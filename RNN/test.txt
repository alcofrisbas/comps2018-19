The Escape                "The land where I shall never be            The love that I shall never see"          Historical Background    Published under the pseudonym, Clive Hamilton, Spirits in Bondage was C.
  S.
 Lewis' first book.
 Released in 1919 by Heinemann, it was reprinted in  1984 by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and included in Lewis' 1994 Collected  Poems.
 It is the first of Lewis' major published works to enter the  public domain in the United States.
 Readers should be aware that in  other countries it may still be under copyright protection.
    Most of the poems appear to have been written between 1915 and 1918, a  period during which Lewis was a student under W.
 T.
 Kirkpatrick, a  military trainee at Oxford, and a soldier serving in the trenches of  World War I.
 Their outlook varies from Romantic expressions of love for  the beauty and simplicity of nature to cynical statements about the  presence of evil in this world.
 In a September 12, 1918 letter to his  friend Arthur Greeves, Lewis said that his book was, "mainly strung  around the idea that I mentioned to you before--that nature is wholly  diabolical & malevolent and that God, if he exists, is outside of and in  opposition to the cosmic arrangements.
" In his cynical poems, Lewis is  dealing with the same questions about evil in nature that Alfred Lord  Tennyson explored from a position of troubled faith in "In Memoriam A.
  H.
" (Stanzas 54f).
 In a letter written perhaps to reassure his father,  Lewis claimed, "You know who the God I blaspheme is and that it is not  the God that you or I worship, or any other Christian.
"    Whatever Lewis believed at that time, the attitude in many of these  poems is quite different from the attitude he expressed in his many  Christian books from the 1930s on.
 Attempts in movies and on stage plays  to portray Lewis as a sheltered professor who knew little about pain  until the death of his wife late in life, have to deal not only with the  many tragedies he experienced from a boy on, but also with the  disturbing issues he faced in many of these early poems.
          Prologue         As of old Phoenician men, to the Tin Isles sailing       Straight against the sunset and the edges of the earth,       Chaunted loud above the storm and the strange sea's wailing,       Legends of their people and the land that gave them birth--       Sang aloud to Baal-Peor, sang unto the horned maiden,       Sang how they should come again with the Brethon treasure laden,       Sang of all the pride and glory of their hardy enterprise,       How they found the outer islands, where the unknown stars arise;       And the rowers down below, rowing hard as they could row,       Toiling at the stroke and feather through the wet and weary weather,       Even they forgot their burden in the measure of a song,       And the merchants and the masters and the bondsmen all together,       Dreaming of the wondrous islands, brought the gallant ship along;       So in mighty deeps alone on the chainless breezes blown       In my coracle of verses I will sing of lands unknown,       Flying from the scarlet city where a Lord that knows no pity,       Mocks the broken people praying round his iron throne,       Sing about the Hidden Country fresh and full of quiet green.
       Sailing over seas uncharted to a port that none has seen.

 Satan Speaks         I am Nature, the Mighty Mother,       I am the law: ye have none other.
         I am the flower and the dewdrop fresh,       I am the lust in your itching flesh.
         I am the battle's filth and strain,       I am the widow's empty pain.
         I am the sea to smother your breath,       I am the bomb, the falling death.
         I am the fact and the crushing reason       To thwart your fantasy's new-born treason.
         I am the spider making her net,       I am the beast with jaws blood-wet.
         I am a wolf that follows the sun       And I will catch him ere day be done.
          II.
 French Nocturne (Monchy-Le-Preux)         Long leagues on either hand the trenches spread       And all is still; now even this gross line       Drinks in the frosty silences divine       The pale, green moon is riding overhead.
         The jaws of a sacked village, stark and grim;       Out on the ridge have swallowed up the sun,       And in one angry streak his blood has run       To left and right along the horizon dim.
         There comes a buzzing plane: and now, it seems       Flies straight into the moon.
 Lo! where he steers       Across the pallid globe and surely nears       In that white land some harbour of dear dreams!         False mocking fancy! Once I too could dream,       Who now can only see with vulgar eye       That he's no nearer to the moon than I       And she's a stone that catches the sun's beam.
         What call have I to dream of anything?       I am a wolf.
 Back to the world again,       And speech of fellow-brutes that once were men       Our throats can bark for slaughter: cannot sing.
          III.
 The Satyr         When the flowery hands of spring       Forth their woodland riches fling,         Through the meadows, through the valleys       Goes the satyr carolling.
         From the mountain and the moor,       Forest green and ocean shore         All the faerie kin he rallies       Making music evermore.
         See! the shaggy pelt doth grow       On his twisted shanks below,         And his dreadful feet are cloven       Though his brow be white as snow--         Though his brow be clear and white       And beneath it fancies bright,         Wisdom and high thoughts are woven       And the musics of delight,         Though his temples too be fair       Yet two horns are growing there         Bursting forth to part asunder       All the riches of his hair.
         Faerie maidens he may meet       Fly the horns and cloven feet,         But, his sad brown eyes with wonder       Seeing-stay from their retreat.
          IV.
 Victory         Roland is dead, Cuchulain's crest is low,       The battered war-rear wastes and turns to rust,       And Helen's eyes and Iseult's lips are dust       And dust the shoulders and the breasts of snow.
         The faerie people from our woods are gone,       No Dryads have I found in all our trees,       No Triton blows his horn about our seas       And Arthur sleeps far hence in Avalon.
         The ancient songs they wither as the grass       And waste as doth a garment waxen old,       All poets have been fools who thought to mould       A monument more durable than brass.
         For these decay: but not for that decays       The yearning, high, rebellious spirit of man       That never rested yet since life began       From striving with red Nature and her ways.
         Now in the filth of war, the baresark shout       Of battle, it is vexed.
 And yet so oft       Out of the deeps, of old, it rose aloft       That they who watch the ages may not doubt.
         Though often bruised, oft broken by the rod,       Yet, like the phoenix, from each fiery bed       Higher the stricken spirit lifts its head       And higher-till the beast become a god.
          V.
 Irish Nocturne         Now the grey mist comes creeping up       From the waste ocean's weedy strand       And fills the valley, as a cup       If filled of evil drink in a wizard's hand;       And the trees fade out of sight,       Like dreary ghosts unhealthily,       Into the damp, pale night,       Till you almost think that a clearer eye could see       Some shape come up of a demon seeking apart       His meat, as Grendel sought in Harte       The thanes that sat by the wintry log--       Grendel or the shadowy mass       Of Balor, or the man with the face of clay,       The grey, grey walker who used to pass       Over the rock-arch nightly to his prey.
       But here at the dumb, slow stream where the willows hang,       With never a wind to blow the mists apart,       Bitter and bitter it is for thee.
 O my heart,       Looking upon this land, where poets sang,       Thus with the dreary shroud       Unwholesome, over it spread,       And knowing the fog and the cloud       In her people's heart and head       Even as it lies for ever upon her coasts       Making them dim and dreamy lest her sons should ever arise       And remember all their boasts;       For I know that the colourless skies       And the blurred horizons breed       Lonely desire and many words and brooding and never a deed.
          VI.
 Spooks         Last night I dreamed that I was come again       Unto the house where my beloved dwells       After long years of wandering and pain.
         And I stood out beneath the drenching rain       And all the street was bare, and black with night,       But in my true love's house was warmth and light.
         Yet I could not draw near nor enter in,       And long I wondered if some secret sin       Or old, unhappy anger held me fast;         Till suddenly it came into my head       That I was killed long since and lying dead--       Only a homeless wraith that way had passed.
         So thus I found my true love's house again       And stood unseen amid the winter night       And the lamp burned within, a rosy light,       And the wet street was shining in the rain.
          VII.
 Apology         If men should ask, Despoina, why I tell       Of nothing glad nor noble in my verse       To lighten hearts beneath this present curse       And build a heaven of dreams in real hell,         Go you to them and speak among them thus:       "There were no greater grief than to recall,       Down in the rotting grave where the lithe worms crawl,       Green fields above that smiled so sweet to us.
"         Is it good to tell old tales of Troynovant       Or praises of dead heroes, tried and sage,       Or sing the queens of unforgotten age,       Brynhild and Maeve and virgin Bradamant?         How should I sing of them? Can it be good       To think of glory now, when all is done,       And all our labour underneath the sun       Has brought us this-and not the thing we would?         All these were rosy visions of the night,       The loveliness and wisdom feigned of old.
       But now we wake.
 The East is pale and cold,       No hope is in the dawn, and no delight.
          VIII.
 Ode for New Year's Day         Woe unto you, ye sons of pain that are this day in earth,       Now cry for all your torment: now curse your hour of birth       And the fathers who begat you to a portion nothing worth.
       And Thou, my own beloved, for as brave as ere thou art,       Bow down thine head, Despoina, clasp thy pale arms over it,       Lie low with fast-closed eyelids, clenched teeth, enduring heart,       For sorrow on sorrow is coming wherein all flesh has part.
       The sky above is sickening, the clouds of God's hate cover it,       Body and soul shall suffer beyond all word or thought,       Till the pain and noisy terror that these first years have wrought       Seem but the soft arising and prelude of the storm       That fiercer still and heavier with sharper lightnings fraught       Shall pour red wrath upon us over a world deform.
         Thrice happy, O Despoina, were the men who were alive       In the great age and the golden age when still the cycle ran       On upward curve and easily, for them both maid and man       And beast and tree and spirit in the green earth could thrive.
       But now one age is ending, and God calls home the stars       And looses the wheel of the ages and sends it spinning back       Amid the death of nations, and points a downward track,       And madness is come over us and great and little wars.
       He has not left one valley, one isle of fresh and green       Where old friends could forgather amid the howling wreck.
       It's vainly we are praying.
 We cannot, cannot check       The Power who slays and puts aside the beauty that has been.
         It's truth they tell, Despoina, none hears the heart's complaining       For Nature will not pity, nor the red God lend an ear,       Yet I too have been mad in the hour of bitter paining       And lifted up my voice to God, thinking that he could hear       The curse wherewith I cursed Him because the Good was dead.
       But lo! I am grown wiser, knowing that our own hearts       Have made a phantom called the Good, while a few years have sped       Over a little planet.
 And what should the great Lord know of it       Who tosses the dust of chaos and gives the suns their parts?       Hither and thither he moves them; for an hour we see the show of it:       Only a little hour, and the life of the race is done.
       And here he builds a nebula, and there he slays a sun       And works his own fierce pleasure.
 All things he shall fulfill,       And O, my poor Despoina, do you think he ever hears       The wail of hearts he has broken, the sound of human ill?       He cares not for our virtues, our little hopes and fears,       And how could it all go on, love, if he knew of laughter and tears?         Ah, sweet, if a man could cheat him! If you could flee away       Into some other country beyond the rosy West,       To hide in the deep forests and be for ever at rest       From the rankling hate of God and the outworn world's decay!          IX.
 Night         After the fret and failure of this day,       And weariness of thought, O Mother Night,       Come with soft kiss to soothe our care away       And all our little tumults set to right;       Most pitiful of all death's kindred fair,       Riding above us through the curtained air       On thy dusk car, thou scatterest to the earth       Sweet dreams and drowsy charms of tender might       And lovers' dear delight before to-morrow's birth.
       Thus art thou wont thy quiet lands to leave       And pillared courts beyond the Milky Way,       Wherein thou tarriest all our solar day       While unsubstantial dreams before thee weave       A foamy dance, and fluttering fancies play       About thy palace in the silver ray       Of some far, moony globe.
 But when the hour,       The long-expected comes, the ivory gates       Open on noiseless hinge before thy bower       Unbidden, and the jewelled chariot waits       With magic steeds.
 Thou from the fronting rim       Bending to urge them, whilst thy sea-dark hair       Falls in ambrosial ripples o'er each limb,       With beautiful pale arms, untrammelled, bare       For horsemanship, to those twin chargers fleet       Dost give full rein across the fires that glow       In the wide floor of heaven, from off their feet       Scattering the powdery star-dust as they go.
       Come swiftly down the sky, O Lady Night,       Fall through the shadow-country, O most kind,       Shake out thy strands of gentle dreams and light       For chains, wherewith thou still art used to bind       With tenderest love of careful leeches' art       The bruised and weary heart       In slumber blind.
          X.
 To Sleep         I will find out a place for thee, O Sleep--       A hidden wood among the hill-tops green,       Full of soft streams and little winds that creep         The murmuring boughs between.
         A hollow cup above the ocean placed       Where nothing rough, nor loud, nor harsh shall be,       But woodland light and shadow interlaced         And summer sky and sea.
         There in the fragrant twilight I will raise       A secret altar of the rich sea sod,       Whereat to offer sacrifice and praise         Unto my lonely god:         Due sacrifice of his own drowsy flowers,       The deadening poppies in an ocean shell       Round which through all forgotten days and hours         The great seas wove their spell.
         So may he send me dreams of dear delight       And draughts of cool oblivion, quenching pain,       And sweet, half-wakeful moments in the night         To hear the falling rain.
         And when he meets me at the dusk of day       To call me home for ever, this I ask--       That he may lead me friendly on that way         And wear no frightful mask.
          XI.
 In Prison         I cried out for the pain of man,       I cried out for my bitter wrath       Against the hopeless life that ran       For ever in a circling path       From death to death since all began;       Till on a summer night       I lost my way in the pale starlight       And saw our planet, far and small,       Through endless depths of nothing fall       A lonely pin-prick spark of light,       Upon the wide, enfolding night,       With leagues on leagues of stars above it,       And powdered dust of stars below--       Dead things that neither hate nor love it       Not even their own loveliness can know,       Being but cosmic dust and dead.
       And if some tears be shed,       Some evil God have power,       Some crown of sorrow sit       Upon a little world for a little hour--       Who shall remember? Who shall care for it?          XII.
 De Profundis         Come let us curse our Master ere we die,       For all our hopes in endless ruin lie.
       The good is dead.
 Let us curse God most High.
         Four thousand years of toil and hope and thought       Wherein man laboured upward and still wrought       New worlds and better, Thou hast made as naught.
         We built us joyful cities, strong and fair,       Knowledge we sought and gathered wisdom rare.
       And all this time you laughed upon our care,         And suddenly the earth grew black with wrong,       Our hope was crushed and silenced was our song,       The heaven grew loud with weeping.
 Thou art strong.
         Come then and curse the Lord.
 Over the earth       Gross darkness falls, and evil was our birth       And our few happy days of little worth.
         Even if it be not all a dream in vain       The ancient hope that still will rise again--       Of a just God that cares for earthly pain,         Yet far away beyond our labouring night,       He wanders in the depths of endless light,       Singing alone his musics of delight;         Only the far, spent echo of his song       Our dungeons and deep cells can smite along,       And Thou art nearer.
 Thou art very strong.
         O universal strength, I know it well,       It is but froth of folly to rebel;       For thou art Lord and hast the keys of Hell.
         Yet I will not bow down to thee nor love thee,       For looking in my own heart I can prove thee,       And know this frail, bruised being is above thee.
         Our love, our hope, our thirsting for the right,       Our mercy and long seeking of the light,       Shall we change these for thy relentless might?         Laugh then and slay.
 Shatter all things of worth,       Heap torment still on torment for thy mirth--       Thou art not Lord while there are Men on earth.
          XIII.
 Satan Speaks         I am the Lord your God: even he that made       Material things, and all these signs arrayed       Above you and have set beneath the race       Of mankind, who forget their Father's face       And even while they drink my light of day       Dream of some other gods and disobey       My warnings, and despise my holy laws,       Even tho' their sin shall slay them.
 For which cause,       Dreams dreamed in vain, a never-filled desire       And in close flesh a spiritual fire,       A thirst for good their kind shall not attain,       A backward cleaving to the beast again.
       A loathing for the life that I have given,       A haunted, twisted soul for ever riven       Between their will and mine-such lot I give       White still in my despite the vermin live.
       They hate my world! Then let that other God       Come from the outer spaces glory-shod,       And from this castle I have built on Night       Steal forth my own thought's children into light,       If such an one there be.
 But far away       He walks the airy fields of endless day,       And my rebellious sons have called Him long       And vainly called.
 My order still is strong       And like to me nor second none I know.
       Whither the mammoth went this creature too shall go.
          XIV.
 The Witch         Trapped amid the woods with guile       They've led her bound in fetters vile       To death, a deadlier sorceress       Than any born for earth's distress       Since first the winner of the fleece       Bore home the Colchian witch to Greece--       Seven months with snare and gin       They've sought the maid o'erwise within       The forest's labyrinthine shade.
       The lonely woodman half afraid       Far off her ragged form has seen       Sauntering down the alleys green,       Or crouched in godless prayer alone       At eve before a Druid stone.
       But now the bitter chase is won,       The quarry's caught, her magic's done,       The bishop's brought her strongest spell       To naught with candle, book, and bell;       With holy water splashed upon her,       She goes to burning and dishonour       Too deeply damned to feel her shame,       For, though beneath her hair of flame       Her thoughtful head be lowly bowed       It droops for meditation proud       Impenitent, and pondering yet       Things no memory can forget,       Starry wonders she has seen       Brooding in the wildwood green       With holiness.
 For who can say       In what strange crew she loved to play,       What demons or what gods of old       Deep mysteries unto her have told       At dead of night in worship bent       At ruined shrines magnificent,       Or how the quivering will she sent       Alone into the great alone       Where all is loved and all is known,       Who now lifts up her maiden eyes       And looks around with soft surprise       Upon the noisy, crowded square,       The city oafs that nod and stare,       The bishop's court that gathers there,       The faggots and the blackened stake       Where sinners die for justice' sake?       Now she is set upon the pile,       The mob grows still a little while,       Till lo! before the eager folk       Up curls a thin, blue line of smoke.
       "Alas!" the full-fed burghers cry,       "That evil loveliness must die!"          XV.
 Dungeon Grates         So piteously the lonely soul of man       Shudders before this universal plan,       So grievous is the burden and the pain,       So heavy weighs the long, material chain       From cause to cause, too merciless for hate,       The nightmare march of unrelenting fate,       I think that he must die thereof unless       Ever and again across the dreariness       There came a sudden glimpse of spirit faces,       A fragrant breath to tell of flowery places       And wider oceans, breaking on the shore       From which the hearts of men are always sore.
       It lies beyond endeavour; neither prayer       Nor fasting, nor much wisdom winneth there,       Seeing how many prophets and wise men       Have sought for it and still returned again       With hope undone.
 But only the strange power       Of unsought Beauty in some casual hour       Can build a bridge of light or sound or form       To lead you out of all this strife and storm;       When of some beauty we are grown a part       Till from its very glory's midmost heart       Out leaps a sudden beam of larger light       Into our souls.
 All things are seen aright       Amid the blinding pillar of its gold,       Seven times more true than what for truth we hold       In vulgar hours.
 The miracle is done       And for one little moment we are one       With the eternal stream of loveliness       That flows so calm, aloft from all distress       Yet leaps and lives around us as a fire       Making us faint with overstrong desire       To sport and swim for ever in its deep--       Only a moment.
                             O! but we shall keep       Our vision still.
 One moment was enough,       We know we are not made of mortal stuff.
       And we can bear all trials that come after,       The hate of men and the fool's loud bestial laughter       And Nature's rule and cruelties unclean,       For we have seen the Glory-we have seen.

 The Philosopher         Who shall be our prophet then,       Chosen from all the sons of men       To lead his fellows on the way       Of hidden knowledge, delving deep       To nameless mysteries that keep       Their secret from the solar day!       Or who shall pierce with surer eye!       This shifting veil of bittersweet       And find the real things that lie       Beyond this turmoil, which we greet       With such a wasted wealth of tears?       Who shall cross over for us the bridge of fears       And pass in to the country where the ancient Mothers dwell?       Is it an elder, bent and hoar       Who, where the waste Atlantic swell       On lonely beaches makes its roar,       In his solitary tower       Through the long night hour by hour       Pores on old books with watery eye       When all his youth has passed him by,       And folly is schooled and love is dead       And frozen fancy laid abed,       While in his veins the gradual blood       Slackens to a marish flood?       For he rejoiceth not in the ocean's might,       Neither the sun giveth delight,       Nor the moon by night       Shall call his feet to wander in the haunted forest lawn.
       He shall no more rise suddenly in the dawn       When mists are white and the dew lies pearly       Cold and cold on every meadow,       To take his joy of the season early,       The opening flower and the westward shadow,       And scarcely can he dream of laughter and love,       They lie so many leaden years behind.
       Such eyes are dim and blind,       And the sad, aching head that nods above       His monstrous books can never know       The secret we would find.
       But let our seer be young and kind       And fresh and beautiful of show,       And taken ere the lustyhead       And rapture of his youth be dead;       Ere the gnawing, peasant reason       School him over-deep in treason       To the ancient high estate       Of his fancy's principate,       That he may live a perfect whole,       A mask of the eternal soul,       And cross at last the shadowy bar       To where the ever-living are.

 The Ocean Strand         O leave the labouring roadways of the town,       The shifting faces and the changeful hue       Of markets, and broad echoing streets that drown       The heart's own silent music.
 Though they too       Sing in their proper rhythm, and still delight       The friendly ear that loves warm human kind,       Yet it is good to leave them all behind,       Now when from lily dawn to purple night       Summer is queen,       Summer is queen in all the happy land.
       Far, far away among the valleys green       Let us go forth and wander hand in hand       Beyond those solemn hills that we have seen       So often welcome home the falling sun       Into their cloudy peaks when day was done--       Beyond them till we find the ocean strand       And hear the great waves run,       With the waste song whose melodies I'd follow       And weary not for many a summer day,       Born of the vaulted breakers arching hollow       Before they flash and scatter into spray,       On, if we should be weary of their play       Then I would lead you further into land       Where, with their ragged walls, the stately rocks       Shunt in smooth courts and paved with quiet sand       To silence dedicate.
 The sea-god's flocks       Have rested here, and mortal eyes have seen       By great adventure at the dead of noon       A lonely nereid drowsing half a-swoon       Buried beneath her dark and dripping locks.

 Noon         Noon! and in the garden bower       The hot air quivers o'er the grass,       The little lake is smooth as glass       And still so heavily the hour       Drags, that scarce the proudest flower       Pressed upon its burning bed       Has strength to lift a languid head:--       Rose and fainting violet       By the water's margin set       Swoon and sink as they were dead       Though their weary leaves be fed       With the foam-drops of the pool       Where it trembles dark and cool       Wrinkled by the fountain spraying       O'er it.
 And the honey-bee       Hums his drowsy melody       And wanders in his course a-straying       Through the sweet and tangled glade       With his golden mead o'erladen,       Where beneath the pleasant shade       Of the darkling boughs a maiden--       Milky limb and fiery tress,       All at sweetest random laid--       Slumbers, drunken with the excess       Of the noontide's loveliness.

 Milton Read Again (In Surrey)         Three golden months while summer on us stole       I have read your joyful tale another time,       Breathing more freely in that larger clime       And learning wiselier to deserve the whole.
         Your Spirit, Master, has been close at hand       And guided me, still pointing treasures rare,       Thick-sown where I before saw nothing fair       And finding waters in the barren land,         Barren once thought because my eyes were dim.
       Like one I am grown to whom the common field       And often-wandered copse one morning yield       New pleasures suddenly; for over him         Falls the weird spirit of unexplained delight,       New mystery in every shady place,       In every whispering tree a nameless grace,       New rapture on the windy seaward height.
         So may she come to me, teaching me well       To savour all these sweets that lie to hand       In wood and lane about this pleasant land       Though it be not the land where I would dwell.

 Sonnet         The stars come out; the fragrant shadows fall       About a dreaming garden still and sweet,       I hear the unseen bats above me bleat       Among the ghostly moths their hunting call,       And twinkling glow-worms all about me crawl.
       Now for a chamber dim, a pillow meet       For slumbers deep as death, a faultless sheet,       Cool, white and smooth.
 So may I reach the hall       With poppies strewn where sleep that is so dear       With magic sponge can wipe away an hour       Or twelve and make them naught.
 Why not a year,       Why could a man not loiter in that bower       Until a thousand painless cycles wore,       And then-what if it held him evermore?          XXI.
 The Autumn Morning         See! the pale autumn dawn       Is faint, upon the lawn         That lies in powdered white             Of hoar-frost dight         And now from tree to tree       The ghostly mist we see         Hung like a silver pall             To hallow all.
         It wreathes the burdened air       So strangely everywhere         That I could almost fear             This silence drear         Where no one song-bird sings       And dream that wizard things         Mighty for hate or love             Were close above.
         White as the fog and fair       Drifting through the middle air         In magic dances dread             Over my head.
         Yet these should know me too       Lover and bondman true,         One that has honoured well             The mystic spell         Of earth's most solemn hours       Wherein the ancient powers         Of dryad, elf, or faun             Or leprechaun         Oft have their faces shown       To me that walked alone         Seashore or haunted fen             Or mountain glen         Wherefore I will not fear       To walk the woodlands sere         Into this autumn day             Far, far away.

 L'Apprenti Sorcier         Suddenly there came to me       The music of a mighty sea       That on a bare and iron shore       Thundered with a deeper roar       Than all the tides that leap and run       With us below the real sun:       Because the place was far away,       Above, beyond our homely day,       Neighbouring close the frozen clime       Where out of all the woods of time,       Amid the frightful seraphim       The fierce, cold eyes of Godhead gleam,       Revolving hate and misery       And wars and famines yet to be.
       And in my dreams I stood alone       Upon a shelf of weedy stone,       And saw before my shrinking eyes       The dark, enormous breakers rise,       And hover and fall with deafening thunder       Of thwarted foam that echoed under       The ledge, through many a cavern drear,       With hollow sounds of wintry fear.
       And through the waters waste and grey,       Thick-strown for many a league away,       Out of the toiling sea arose       Many a face and form of those       Thin, elemental people dear       Who live beyond our heavy sphere.
       And all at once from far and near,       They all held out their arms to me,       Crying in their melody,       "Leap in! Leap in and take thy fill       Of all the cosmic good and ill,       Be as the Living ones that know       Enormous joy, enormous woe,       Pain beyond thought and fiery bliss:       For all thy study hunted this,       On wings of magic to arise,       And wash from off thy filmed eyes       The cloud of cold mortality,       To find the real life and be       As are the children of the deep!       Be bold and dare the glorious leap,       Or to thy shame, go, slink again       Back to the narrow ways of men.
"       So all these mocked me as I stood       Striving to wake because I feared the flood.

 Alexandrines         There is a house that most of all on earth I hate.
       Though I have passed through many sorrows and have been       In bloody fields, sad seas, and countries desolate,       Yet most I fear that empty house where the grasses green       Grow in the silent court the gaping flags between,       And down the moss-grown paths and terrace no man treads       Where the old, old weeds rise deep on the waste garden beds.
       Like eyes of one long dead the empty windows stare       And I fear to cross the garden, I fear to linger there,       For in that house I know a little, silent room       Where Someone's always waiting, waiting in the gloom       To draw me with an evil eye, and hold me fast--       Yet thither doom will drive me and He will win at last.

 In Praise of Solid People         Thank God that there are solid folk       Who water flowers and roll the lawn,       And sit an sew and talk and smoke,       And snore all through the summer dawn.
         Who pass untroubled nights and days       Full-fed and sleepily content,       Rejoicing in each other's praise,       Respectable and innocent.
         Who feel the things that all men feel,       And think in well-worn grooves of thought,       Whose honest spirits never reel       Before man's mystery, overwrought.
         Yet not unfaithful nor unkind,       with work-day virtues surely staid,       Theirs is the sane and humble mind,       And dull affections undismayed.
         O happy people! I have seen       No verse yet written in your praise,       And, truth to tell, the time has been       I would have scorned your easy ways.
         But now thro' weariness and strife       I learn your worthiness indeed,       The world is better for such life       As stout suburban people lead.
         Too often have I sat alone       When the wet night falls heavily,       And fretting winds around me moan,       And homeless longing vexes me         For lore that I shall never know,       And visions none can hope to see,       Till brooding works upon me so       A childish fear steals over me.
         I look around the empty room,       The clock still ticking in its place,       And all else silent as the tomb,       Till suddenly, I think, a face         Grows from the darkness just beside.
       I turn, and lo! it fades away,       And soon another phantom tide       Of shifting dreams begins to play,         And dusky galleys past me sail,       Full freighted on a faerie sea;       I hear the silken merchants hail       Across the ringing waves to me         --Then suddenly, again, the room,       Familiar books about me piled,       And I alone amid the gloom,       By one more mocking dream beguiled.
         And still no neared to the Light,       And still no further from myself,       Alone and lost in clinging night--       (The clock's still ticking on the shelf).
         Then do I envy solid folk       Who sit of evenings by the fire,       After their work and doze and smoke,       And are not fretted by desire.

 Song of the Pilgrims         O Dwellers at the back of the North Wind,       What have we done to you? How have we sinned       Wandering the Earth from Orkney unto Ind?         With many deaths our fellowship is thinned,       Our flesh is withered in the parching wind,       Wandering the earth from Orkney unto Ind.
         We have no rest.
 We cannot turn again       Back to the world and all her fruitless pain,       Having once sought the land where ye remain.
         Some say ye are not.
 But, ah God! we know       That somewhere, somewhere past the Northern snow       Waiting for us the red-rose gardens blow:         --The red-rose and the white-rose gardens blow       In the green Northern land to which we go,       Surely the ways are long and the years are slow.
         We have forsaken all things sweet and fair,       We have found nothing worth a moment's care       Because the real flowers are blowing there.
         Land of the Lotus fallen from the sun,       Land of the Lake from whence all rivers run,       Land where the hope of all our dreams is won!         Shall we not somewhere see at close of day       The green walls of that country far away,       And hear the music of her fountains play?         So long we have been wandering all this while       By many a perilous sea and drifting isle,       We scarce shall dare to look thereon and smile.
         Yea, when we are drawing very near to thee,       And when at last the ivory port we see       Our hearts will faint with mere felicity:         But we shall wake again in gardens bright       Of green and gold for infinite delight,       Sleeping beneath the solemn mountains white,       While from the flowery copses still unseen       Sing out the crooning birds that ne'er have been       Touched by the hand of winter frore and lean;         And ever living queens that grow not old       And poets wise in robes of faerie gold       Whisper a wild, sweet song that first was told         Ere God sat down to make the Milky Way.
       And in those gardens we shall sleep and play       For ever and for ever and a day.
         Ah, Dwellers at the back of the North Wind,       What have we done to you? How have we sinned,       That yes should hide beyond the Northern wind?         Land of the Lotus, fallen from the Sun,       When shall your hidden, flowery vales be won       And all the travail of our way be done?         Very far we have searched; we have even seen       The Scythian waste that bears no soft nor green,       And near the Hideous Pass our feet have been.
         We have heard Syrens singing all night long       Beneath the unknown stars their lonely song       In friendless seas beyond the Pillars strong.
         Nor by the dragon-daughter of Hypocras       Nor the vale of the Devil's head we have feared to pass,       Yet is our labour lost and vain, alas!         Scouring the earth from Orkney unto Ind,       Tossed on the seas and withered in the wind,       We seek and seek your land.
 How have we sinned?         Or is it all a folly of the wise,       Bidding us walk these ways with blinded eyes       While all around us real flowers arise?         But, by the very God, we know, we know       That somewhere still, beyond the Northern snow       Waiting for us the red-rose gardens blow.

 Song         Faeries must be in the woods       Or the satyrs' laughing broods--       Tritons in the summer sea,       Else how could the dead things be       Half so lovely as they are?       How could wealth of star on star       Dusted o'er the frosty night       Fill thy spirit with delight       And lead thee from this care of thine       Up among the dreams divine,       Were it not that each and all       Of them that walk the heavenly hall       Is in truth a happy isle,       Where eternal meadows smile,       And golden globes of fruit are seen       Twinkling through the orchards green;       Were the Other People go       On the bright sward to and fro?       Atoms dead could never thus       Stir the human heart of us       Unless the beauty that we see       The veil of endless beauty be,       Filled full of spirits that have trod       Far hence along the heavenly sod       And see the bright footprints of God.

 The Ass         I woke and rose and slipt away       To the heathery hills in the morning grey.
         In a field where the dew lay cold and deep       I met an ass, new-roused from sleep.
         I stroked his nose and I tickled his ears,       And spoke soft words to quiet his fears.
         His eyes stared into the eyes of me       And he kissed my hands of his courtesy.
         "O big, brown brother out of the waste,       How do thistles for breakfast taste?         "And do you rejoice in the dawn divine       With a heart that is glad no less than mine?         "For, brother, the depth of your gentle eyes       Is strange and mystic as the skies:         "What are the thoughts that grope behind,       Down in the mist of a donkey mind?         "Can it be true, as the wise men tell,       That you are a mask of God as well,         "And, as in us, so in you no less       Speaks the eternal Loveliness,         "And words of the lips that all things know       Among the thoughts of a donkey go?         "However it be, O four-foot brother,       Fair to-day is the earth, our mother.
         "God send you peace and delight thereof,       And all green meat of the waste you love,         "And guard you well from violent men       Who'd put you back in the shafts again.
"         But the ass had far too wise a head       To answer one of the things I said,         So he twitched his fair ears up and down       And turned to nuzzle his shoulder brown.

 Ballade Mystique         The big, red-house is bare and lone       The stony garden waste and sere       With blight of breezes ocean blown       To pinch the wakening of the year;       My kindly friends with busy cheer       My wretchedness could plainly show.
       They tell me I am lonely here--       What do they know? What do they know?         They think that while the gables moan       And easements creak in winter drear       I should be piteously alone       Without the speech of comrades dear;       And friendly for my sake they fear,       It grieves them thinking of me so       While all their happy life is near--       What do they know? What do they know?         That I have seen the Dagda's throne       In sunny lands without a tear       And found a forest all my own       To ward with magic shield and spear,       Where, through the stately towers I rear       For my desire, around me go       Immortal shapes of beauty clear:       They do not know, they do not know.

 Night         I know a little Druid wood       Where I would slumber if I could       And have the murmuring of the stream       To mingle with a midnight dream,       And have the holy hazel trees       To play above me in the breeze,       And smell the thorny eglantine;       For there the white owls all night long       In the scented gloom divine       Hear the wild, strange, tuneless song       Of faerie voices, thin and high       As the bat's unearthly cry,       And the measure of their shoon       Dancing, dancing, under the moon,       Until, amid the pale of dawn       The wandering stars begin to swoon.

       Ah, leave the world and come away!         The windy folk are in the glade,       And men have seen their revels, laid       In secret on some flowery lawn       Underneath the beechen covers,       Kings of old, I've heard them say,       Here have found them faerie lovers       That charmed them out of life and kissed       Their lips with cold lips unafraid,       And such a spell around them made       That they have passed beyond the mist       And found the Country-under-wave.

 Oxford         It is well that there are palaces of peace       And discipline and dreaming and desire,       Lest we forget our heritage and cease       The Spirit's work-to hunger and aspire:         Lest we forget that we were born divine,       Now tangled in red battle's animal net,       Murder the work and lust the anodyne,       Pains of the beast 'gainst bestial solace set.
         But this shall never be: to us remains       One city that has nothing of the beast,       That was not built for gross, material gains,       Sharp, wolfish power or empire's glutted feast.
         We are not wholly brute.
 To us remains       A clean, sweet city lulled by ancient streams,       A place of visions and of loosening chains,       A refuge of the elect, a tower of dreams.
         She was not builded out of common stone       But out of all men's yearning and all prayer       That she might live, eternally our own,       The Spirit's stronghold-barred against despair.

 Hymn (For Boys' Voices)         All the things magicians do       Could be done by me and you       Freely, if we only knew.
         Human children every day       Could play at games the faeries play       If they were but shown the way.
         Every man a God would be       Laughing through eternity       If as God's his eyes could see.
         All the wizardries of God--       Slaying matter with a nod,       Charming spirits with his rod,         With the singing of his voice       Making lonely lands rejoice,       Leaving us no will nor choice,         Drawing headlong me and you       As the piping Orpheus drew       Man and beast the mountains through,         By the sweetness of his horn       Calling us from lands forlorn       Nearer to the widening morn--         All that loveliness of power       Could be man's peculiar dower,       Even mine, this very hour;         We should reach the Hidden Land       And grow immortal out of hand,       If we could but understand!         We could revel day and night       In all power and all delight       If we learn to think aright.

 "Our Daily Bread"         We need no barbarous words nor solemn spell       To raise the unknown.
 It lies before our feet;       There have been men who sank down into Hell         In some suburban street,         And some there are that in their daily walks       Have met archangels fresh from sight of God,       Or watched how in their beans and cabbage-stalks         Long files of faerie trod.
         Often me too the Living voices call       In many a vulgar and habitual place,       I catch a sight of lands beyond the wall,         I see a strange god's face.
         And some day this work will work upon me so       I shall arise and leave both friends and home       And over many lands a pilgrim go         Through alien woods and foam,         Seeking the last steep edges of the earth       Whence I may leap into that gulf of light       Wherein, before my narrowing Self had birth,         Part of me lived aright.
          XXXIII.
 How He Saw Angus the God         I heard the swallow sing in the eaves and rose       All in a strange delight while others slept,       And down the creaking stair, alone, tip-toes,         So carefully I crept.
         The house was dark with silly blinds yet drawn,       But outside the clean air was filled with light,       And underneath my feet the cold, wet lawn         With dew was twinkling bright.
         The cobwebs hung from every branch and spray       Gleaming with pearly strands of laden thread,       And long and still the morning shadows lay         Across the meadows spread.
         At that pure hour when yet no sound of man,       Stirs in the whiteness of the wakening earth,       Alone through innocent solitudes I ran         Singing aloud for mirth.
         Till I had found the open mountain heath       Yellow with gorse, and rested there and stood       To gaze upon the misty sea beneath,         Or on the neighbouring wood,         --That little wood of hazel and tall pine       And youngling fir, where oft we have loved to see       The level beams of early morning shine         Freshly from tree to tree.
         Through the denser wood there's many a pool       Of deep and night-born shadow lingers yet       Where the new-wakened flowers are damp and cool         And the long grass is wet.
         In the sweet heather long I rested there       Looking upon the dappled, early sky,       When suddenly, from out the shining air         A god came flashing by.
         Swift, naked, eager, pitilessly fair,       With a live crown of birds about his head,       Singing and fluttering, and his fiery hair,         Far out behind him spread,         Streamed like a rippling torch upon the breeze       Of his own glorious swiftness: in the grass       He bruised no feathery stalk, and through the trees         I saw his whiteness pass.
         But when I followed him beyond the wood,       Lo! He was changed into a solemn bull       That there upon the open pasture stood         And browsed his lazy full.
          XXXIV.
 The Roads         I stand on the windy uplands among the hills of Down       With all the world spread out beneath, meadow and sea and town,       And ploughlands on the far-off hills that glow with friendly brown.
         And ever across the rolling land to the far horizon line,       Where the blue hills border the misty west, I see the white roads twine,       The rare roads and the fair roads that call this heart of mine.
         I see them dip in the valleys and vanish and rise and bend       From shadowy dell to windswept fell, and still to the West they wend,       And over the cold blue ridge at last to the great world's uttermost end.
         And the call of the roads is upon me, a desire in my spirit has grown       To wander forth in the highways, 'twixt earth and sky alone,       And seek for the lands no foot has trod and the seas no sail has known:         For the lands to the west of the evening and east of the morning's birth,       Where the gods unseen in their valleys green are glad at the ends of the earth       And fear no morrow to bring them sorrow, nor night to quench their mirth.
          XXXV.
 Hesperus         Through the starry hollow       Of the summer night       I would follow, follow       Hesperus the bright,       To seek beyond the western wave       His garden of delight.
         Hesperus the fairest       Of all gods that are,       Peace and dreams thou bearest       In thy shadowy car,       And often in my evening walks       I've blessed thee from afar.
         Stars without number,       Dust the noon of night,       Thou the early slumber       And the still delight       Of the gentle twilit hours       Rulest in thy right.
         When the pale skies shiver,       Seeing night is done,       Past the ocean-river,       Lightly thou dost run,       To look for pleasant, sleepy lands,       That never fear the sun.
         Where, beyond the waters       Of the outer sea,       Thy triple crown of daughters       That guards the golden tree       Sing out across the lonely tide       A welcome home to thee.
         And while the old, old dragon       For joy lifts up his head,       They bring thee forth a flagon       Of nectar foaming red,       And underneath the drowsy trees       Of poppies strew thy bed.
         Ah! that I could follow       In thy footsteps bright,       Through the starry hollow       Of the summer night,       Sloping down the western ways       To find my heart's delight!          XXXVI.
 The Star Bath         A place uplifted towards the midnight sky       Far, far away among the mountains old,       A treeless waste of rocks and freezing cold,       Where the dead, cheerless moon rode neighbouring by--       And in the midst a silent tarn there lay,       A narrow pool, cold as the tide that flows       Where monstrous bergs beyond Varanger stray,       Rising from sunless depths that no man knows;       Thither as clustering fireflies have I seen       At fixed seasons all the stars come down       To wash in that cold wave their brightness clean       And win the special fire wherewith they crown       The wintry heavens in frost.
 Even as a flock       Of falling birds, down to the pool they came.
       I saw them and I heard the icy shock       Of stars engulfed with hissing of faint flame--       Ages ago before the birth of men       Or earliest beast.
 Yet I was still the same       That now remember, knowing not where or when.
          XXXVII.
 Tu Ne Quaesieris         For all the lore of Lodge and Myers       I cannot heal my torn desires,       Nor hope for all that man can speer       To make the riddling earth grow clear.
       Though it were sure and proven well       That I shall prosper, as they tell,       In fields beneath a different sun       By shores where other oceans run,       When this live body that was I       Lies hidden from the cheerful sky,       Yet what were endless lives to me       If still my narrow self I be       And hope and fail and struggle still,       And break my will against God's will,       To play for stakes of pleasure and pain       And hope and fail and hope again,       Deluded, thwarted, striving elf       That through the window of my self       As through a dark glass scarce can see       A warped and masked reality?       But when this searching thought of mine       Is mingled in the large Divine,       And laughter that was in my mouth       Runs through the breezes of the South,       When glory I have built in dreams       Along some fiery sunset gleams,       And my dead sin and foolishness       Grow one with Nature's whole distress,       To perfect being I shall win,       And where I end will Life begin.
          XXXVIII.
 Lullaby         Lullaby! Lullaby!       There's a tower strong and high       Built of oak and brick and stone,       Stands before a wood alone.
       The doors are of the oak so brown       As any ale in Oxford town,       The walls are builded warm and thick       Of the old red Roman brick,       The good grey stone is over all       In arch and floor of the tower tall.
       And maidens three are living there       All in the upper chamber fair,       Hung with silver, hung with pall,       And stories painted on the wall.
       And softly goes the whirring loom       In my ladies' upper room,       For they shall spin both night and day       Until the stars do pass away.
       But every night at evening.
       The window open wide they fling,       And one of them says a word they know       And out as three white swans they go,       And the murmuring of the woods is drowned       In the soft wings' whirring sound,       As they go flying round, around,       Singing in swans' voices high       A lonely, lovely lullaby.
          XXXIX.
 World's Desire         Love, there is a castle built in a country desolate,       On a rock above a forest where the trees are grim and great,       Blasted with the lightning sharp-giant boulders strewn between,       And the mountains rise above, and the cold ravine       Echoes to the crushing roar and thunder of a mighty river       Raging down a cataract.
 Very tower and forest quiver       And the grey wolves are afraid and the call of birds is drowned,       And the thought and speech of man in the boiling water's sound.
       But upon the further side of the barren, sharp ravine       With the sunlight on its turrets is the castle seen,       Calm and very wonderful, white above the green       Of the wet and waving forest, slanted all away,       Because the driving Northern wind will not rest by night or day.
       Yet the towers are sure above, very mighty is the stead,       The gates are made of ivory, the roofs of copper red.
         Round and round the warders grave walk upon the walls for ever       And the wakeful dragons couch in the ports of ivory,       Nothing is can trouble it, hate of the gods nor man's endeavour,       And it shall be a resting-place, dear heart, for you and me.
         Through the wet and waving forest with an age-old sorrow laden       Singing of the world's regret wanders wild the faerie maiden,       Through the thistle and the brier, through the tangles of the thorn,       Till her eyes be dim with weeping and her homeless feet are torn.
         Often to the castle gate up she looks with vain endeavour,       For her soulless loveliness to the castle winneth never.
         But within the sacred court, hidden high upon the mountain,       Wandering in the castle gardens lovely folk enough there be,       Breathing in another air, drinking of a purer fountain       And among that folk, beloved, there's a place for you and me.
          XL.
 Death in Battle         Open the gates for me,       Open the gates of the peaceful castle, rosy in the West,       In the sweet dim Isle of Apples over the wide sea's breast,         Open the gates for me!         Sorely pressed have I been       And driven and hurt beyond bearing this summer day,       But the heat and the pain together suddenly fall away,       All's cool and green.
         But a moment agone,       Among men cursing in fight and toiling, blinded I fought,       But the labour passed on a sudden even as a passing thought,         And now-alone!         Ah, to be ever alone,       In flowery valleys among the mountains and silent wastes untrod,       In the dewy upland places, in the garden of God,       This would atone!         I shall not see       The brutal, crowded faces around me, that in their toil have grown       Into the faces of devils-yea, even as my own--       When I find thee,         O Country of Dreams!       Beyond the tide of the ocean, hidden and sunk away,       Out of the sound of battles, near to the end of day,       Full of dim woods and streams.

If I lay here dead  XXIV    Let the world's sharpness like a clasping knife  XXV     A heavy heart, Beloved, have I borne  XXVI    I lived with visions for my company  XXVII   My own Beloved, who hast lifted me  XXVIII  My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!

XLI     I thank all who have loved me in their hearts  XLII    My future will not copy fair my past  XLIII   How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways  XLIV    Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers          I      I thought once how Theocritus had sung  Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,  Who each one in a gracious hand appears  To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:  And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,  I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,  The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,  Those of my own life, who by turns had flung  A shadow across me.
  Straightway I was 'ware,  So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move  Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;  And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,--  "Guess now who holds thee!"--"Death," I said, But, there,  The silver answer rang, "Not Death, but Love.
"          II      But only three in all God's universe  Have heard this word thou hast said,--Himself, beside  Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied  One of us .
 .
 .
 that was God, .
 .
 .
 and laid the curse  So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce  My sight from seeing thee,--that if I had died,  The death-weights, placed there, would have signified  Less absolute exclusion.
  "Nay" is worse  From God than from all others, O my friend!  Men could not part us with their worldly jars,  Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;  Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:  And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,  We should but vow the faster for the stars.
          III      Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart!  Unlike our uses and our destinies.
  Our ministering two angels look surprise  On one another, as they strike athwart  Their wings in passing.
  Thou, bethink thee, art  A guest for queens to social pageantries,  With gages from a hundred brighter eyes  Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part  Of chief musician.
  What hast thou to do  With looking from the lattice-lights at me,  A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through  The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?  The chrism is on thine head,--on mine, the dew,--  And Death must dig the level where these agree.
          IV      Thou hast thy calling to some palace-floor,  Most gracious singer of high poems! where  The dancers will break footing, from the care  Of watching up thy pregnant lips for more.
  And dost thou lift this house's latch too poor  For hand of thine? and canst thou think and bear  To let thy music drop here unaware  In folds of golden fulness at my door?  Look up and see the casement broken in,  The bats and owlets builders in the roof!  My cricket chirps against thy mandolin.
  Hush, call no echo up in further proof  Of desolation! there's a voice within  That weeps .
 .
 .
 as thou must sing .
 .
 .
 alone, aloof.
          V      I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,  As once Electra her sepulchral urn,  And, looking in thine eyes, I over-turn  The ashes at thy feet.
  Behold and see  What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,  And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn  Through the ashen greyness.
  If thy foot in scorn  Could tread them out to darkness utterly,  It might be well perhaps.
  But if instead  Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow  The grey dust up, .
 .
 .
 those laurels on thine head,  O my Beloved, will not shield thee so,  That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred  The hair beneath.
  Stand further off then! go!          VI      Go from me.
  Yet I feel that I shall stand  Henceforward in thy shadow.
  Nevermore  Alone upon the threshold of my door  Of individual life, I shall command  The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand  Serenely in the sunshine as before,  Without the sense of that which I forbore--  Thy touch upon the palm.
  The widest land  Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine  With pulses that beat double.
  What I do  And what I dream include thee, as the wine  Must taste of its own grapes.
  And when I sue  God for myself, He hears that name of thine,  And sees within my eyes the tears of two.
          VII      The face of all the world is changed, I think,  Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul  Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole  Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink  Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,  Was caught up into love, and taught the whole  Of life in a new rhythm.
  The cup of dole  God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,  And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.
  The names of country, heaven, are changed away  For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;  And this .
 .
 .
 this lute and song .
 .
 .
 loved yesterday,  (The singing angels know) are only dear  Because thy name moves right in what they say.
          VIII      What can I give thee back, O liberal  And princely giver, who hast brought the gold  And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,  And laid them on the outside of the wall  For such as I to take or leave withal,  In unexpected largesse? am I cold,  Ungrateful, that for these most manifold  High gifts, I render nothing back at all?  Not so; not cold,--but very poor instead.
  Ask God who knows.
  For frequent tears have run  The colours from my life, and left so dead  And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done  To give the same as pillow to thy head.
  Go farther! let it serve to trample on.
          IX      Can it be right to give what I can give?  To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears  As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years  Re-sighing on my lips renunciative  Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live  For all thy adjurations?  O my fears,  That this can scarce be right!  We are not peers  So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,  That givers of such gifts as mine are, must  Be counted with the ungenerous.
  Out, alas!  I will not soil thy purple with my dust,  Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,  Nor give thee any love--which were unjust.
  Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass.
          X      Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed  And worthy of acceptation.
  Fire is bright,  Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light  Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:  And love is fire.
  And when I say at need  I love thee .
 .
 .
 mark! .
 .
 .
 I love thee--in thy sight  I stand transfigured, glorified aright,  With conscience of the new rays that proceed  Out of my face toward thine.
  There's nothing low  In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures  Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
  And what I feel, across the inferior features  Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show  How that great work of Love enhances Nature's.
          XI      And therefore if to love can be desert,  I am not all unworthy.
  Cheeks as pale  As these you see, and trembling knees that fail  To bear the burden of a heavy heart,--  This weary minstrel-life that once was girt  To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail  To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale  A melancholy music,--why advert  To these things?  O Beloved, it is plain  I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!  And yet, because I love thee, I obtain  From that same love this vindicating grace  To live on still in love, and yet in vain,--  To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.
          XII      Indeed this very love which is my boast,  And which, when rising up from breast to brow,  Doth crown me with a ruby large enow  To draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost,--  This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,  I should not love withal, unless that thou  Hadst set me an example, shown me how,  When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,  And love called love.
  And thus, I cannot speak  Of love even, as a good thing of my own:  Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,  And placed it by thee on a golden throne,--  And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)  Is by thee only, whom I love alone.
          XIII      And wilt thou have me fashion into speech  The love I bear thee, finding words enough,  And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,  Between our faces, to cast light on each?--  I drop it at thy feet.
  I cannot teach  My hand to hold my spirits so far off  From myself--me--that I should bring thee proof  In words, of love hid in me out of reach.
  Nay, let the silence of my womanhood  Commend my woman-love to thy belief,--  Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,  And rend the garment of my life, in brief,  By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,  Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.
          XIV      If thou must love me, let it be for nought  Except for love's sake only.
  Do not say  "I love her for her smile--her look--her way  Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought  That falls in well with mine, and certes brought  A sense of pleasant ease on such a day"--  For these things in themselves, Beloved, may  Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought,  May be unwrought so.
  Neither love me for  Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,--  A creature might forget to weep, who bore  Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!  But love me for love's sake, that evermore  Thou may'st love on, through love's eternity.
          XV      Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear  Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;  For we two look two ways, and cannot shine  With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.
  On me thou lookest with no doubting care,  As on a bee shut in a crystalline;  Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love's divine,  And to spread wing and fly in the outer air  Were most impossible failure, if I strove  To fail so.
  But I look on thee--on thee--  Beholding, besides love, the end of love,  Hearing oblivion beyond memory;  As one who sits and gazes from above,  Over the rivers to the bitter sea.
          XVI      And yet, because thou overcomest so,  Because thou art more noble and like a king,  Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling  Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow  Too close against thine heart henceforth to know  How it shook when alone.
  Why, conquering  May prove as lordly and complete a thing  In lifting upward, as in crushing low!  And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword  To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,  Even so, Beloved, I at last record,  Here ends my strife.
  If thou invite me forth,  I rise above abasement at the word.
  Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth!          XVII      My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes  God set between His After and Before,  And strike up and strike off the general roar  Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats  In a serene air purely.
  Antidotes  Of medicated music, answering for  Mankind's forlornest uses, thou canst pour  From thence into their ears.
  God's will devotes  Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.
  How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?  A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine  Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?  A shade, in which to sing--of palm or pine?  A grave, on which to rest from singing?  Choose.
          XVIII      I never gave a lock of hair away  To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,  Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully  I ring out to the full brown length and say  "Take it.
"  My day of youth went yesterday;  My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee,  Nor plant I it from rose- or myrtle-tree,  As girls do, any more: it only may  Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,  Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside  Through sorrow's trick.
  I thought the funeral-shears  Would take this first, but Love is justified,--  Take it thou,--finding pure, from all those years,  The kiss my mother left here when she died.
          XIX      The soul's Rialto hath its merchandize;  I barter curl for curl upon that mart,  And from my poet's forehead to my heart  Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,--  As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes  The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart  The nine white Muse-brows.
  For this counterpart, .
 .
 .
  The bay crown's shade, Beloved, I surmise,  Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!  Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,  I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,  And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;  Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack  No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.
          XX      Beloved, my Beloved, when I think  That thou wast in the world a year ago,  What time I sat alone here in the snow  And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink  No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,  Went counting all my chains as if that so  They never could fall off at any blow  Struck by thy possible hand,--why, thus I drink  Of life's great cup of wonder!  Wonderful,  Never to feel thee thrill the day or night  With personal act or speech,--nor ever cull  Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white  Thou sawest growing!  Atheists are as dull,  Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight.
          XXI      Say over again, and yet once over again,  That thou dost love me.
  Though the word repeated  Should seem a "cuckoo-song," as thou dost treat it,  Remember, never to the hill or plain,  Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain  Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.
  Beloved, I, amid the darkness greeted  By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt's pain  Cry, "Speak once more--thou lovest!"  Who can fear  Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,  Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?  Say thou dost love me, love me, love me--toll  The silver iterance!--only minding, Dear,  To love me also in silence with thy soul.
          XXII      When our two souls stand up erect and strong,  Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,  Until the lengthening wings break into fire  At either curved point,--what bitter wrong  Can the earth do to us, that we should not long  Be here contented?  Think!  In mounting higher,  The angels would press on us and aspire  To drop some golden orb of perfect song  Into our deep, dear silence.
  Let us stay  Rather on earth, Beloved,--where the unfit  Contrarious moods of men recoil away  And isolate pure spirits, and permit  A place to stand and love in for a day,  With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.
          XXIII      Is it indeed so?  If I lay here dead,  Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?  And would the sun for thee more coldly shine  Because of grave-damps falling round my head?  I marvelled, my Beloved, when I read  Thy thought so in the letter.
  I am thine--  But .
 .
 .
 so much to thee?  Can I pour thy wine  While my hands tremble?  Then my soul, instead  Of dreams of death, resumes life's lower range.
  Then, love me, Love! look on me--breathe on me!  As brighter ladies do not count it strange,  For love, to give up acres and degree,  I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange  My near sweet view of heaven, for earth with thee!          XXIV      Let the world's sharpness like a clasping knife  Shut in upon itself and do no harm  In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,  And let us hear no sound of human strife  After the click of the shutting.
  Life to life--  I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,  And feel as safe as guarded by a charm  Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife  Are weak to injure.
  Very whitely still  The lilies of our lives may reassure  Their blossoms from their roots, accessible  Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer;  Growing straight, out of man's reach, on the hill.
  God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.
          XXV      A heavy heart, Beloved, have I borne  From year to year until I saw thy face,  And sorrow after sorrow took the place  Of all those natural joys as lightly worn  As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn  By a beating heart at dance-time.
  Hopes apace  Were changed to long despairs, till God's own grace  Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn  My heavy heart.
  Then thou didst bid me bring  And let it drop adown thy calmly great  Deep being!  Fast it sinketh, as a thing  Which its own nature does precipitate,  While thine doth close above it, mediating  Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.
          XXVI      I lived with visions for my company  Instead of men and women, years ago,  And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know  A sweeter music than they played to me.
  But soon their trailing purple was not free  Of this world's dust, their lutes did silent grow,  And I myself grew faint and blind below  Their vanishing eyes.
  Then thou didst come--to be,  Beloved, what they seemed.
  Their shining fronts,  Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,  As river-water hallowed into fonts)  Met in thee, and from out thee overcame  My soul with satisfaction of all wants:  Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.
          XXVII      My own Beloved, who hast lifted me  From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,  And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown  A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully  Shines out again, as all the angels see,  Before thy saving kiss!  My own, my own,  Who camest to me when the world was gone,  And I who looked for only God, found thee!  I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad.
  As one who stands in dewless asphodel,  Looks backward on the tedious time he had  In the upper life,--so I, with bosom-swell,  Make witness, here, between the good and bad,  That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well.
          XXVIII      My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!  And yet they seem alive and quivering  Against my tremulous hands which loose the string  And let them drop down on my knee to-night.
  This said,--he wished to have me in his sight  Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring  To come and touch my hand .
 .
 .
 a simple thing,  Yet I wept for it!--this, .
 .
 .
 the paper's light .
 .
 .
  Said, Dear I love thee; and I sank and quailed  As if God's future thundered on my past.
  This said, I am thine--and so its ink has paled  With lying at my heart that beat too fast.
  And this .
 .
 .
 O Love, thy words have ill availed  If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!          XXIX      I think of thee!--my thoughts do twine and bud  About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,  Put out broad leaves, and soon there's nought to see  Except the straggling green which hides the wood.
  Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood  I will not have my thoughts instead of thee  Who art dearer, better!  Rather, instantly  Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,  Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,  And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee,  Drop heavily down,--burst, shattered everywhere!  Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee  And breathe within thy shadow a new air,  I do not think of thee--I am too near thee.
          XXX      I see thine image through my tears to-night,  And yet to-day I saw thee smiling.
  How  Refer the cause?--Beloved, is it thou  Or I, who makes me sad?  The acolyte  Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite  May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,  On the altar-stair.
  I hear thy voice and vow,  Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,  As he, in his swooning ears, the choir's amen.
  Beloved, dost thou love? or did I see all  The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when  Too vehement light dilated my ideal,  For my soul's eyes?  Will that light come again,  As now these tears come--falling hot and real?          XXXI      Thou comest! all is said without a word.
  I sit beneath thy looks, as children do  In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through  Their happy eyelids from an unaverred  Yet prodigal inward joy.
  Behold, I erred  In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue  The sin most, but the occasion--that we two  Should for a moment stand unministered  By a mutual presence.
  Ah, keep near and close,  Thou dove-like help! and when my fears would rise,  With thy broad heart serenely interpose:  Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies  These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,  Like callow birds left desert to the skies.
          XXXII      The first time that the sun rose on thine oath  To love me, I looked forward to the moon  To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon  And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
  Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;  And, looking on myself, I seemed not one  For such man's love!--more like an out-of-tune  Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth  To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,  Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
  I did not wrong myself so, but I placed  A wrong on thee.
  For perfect strains may float  'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,--  And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.
          XXXIII      Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear  The name I used to run at, when a child,  From innocent play, and leave the cowslips plied,  To glance up in some face that proved me dear  With the look of its eyes.
  I miss the clear  Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled  Into the music of Heaven's undefiled,  Call me no longer.
  Silence on the bier,  While I call God--call God!--so let thy mouth  Be heir to those who are now exanimate.
  Gather the north flowers to complete the south,  And catch the early love up in the late.
  Yes, call me by that name,--and I, in truth,  With the same heart, will answer and not wait.
          XXXIV      With the same heart, I said, I'll answer thee  As those, when thou shalt call me by my name--  Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,  Perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy?  When called before, I told how hastily  I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.
  To run and answer with the smile that came  At play last moment, and went on with me  Through my obedience.
  When I answer now,  I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;  Yet still my heart goes to thee--ponder how--  Not as to a single good, but all my good!  Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow  That no child's foot could run fast as this blood.
          XXXV      If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange  And be all to me?  Shall I never miss  Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss  That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,  When I look up, to drop on a new range  Of walls and floors, another home than this?  Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is  Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change  That's hardest.
  If to conquer love, has tried,  To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove,  For grief indeed is love and grief beside.
  Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.
  Yet love me--wilt thou?  Open thy heart wide,  And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.
          XXXVI      When we met first and loved, I did not build  Upon the event with marble.
  Could it mean  To last, a love set pendulous between  Sorrow and sorrow?  Nay, I rather thrilled,  Distrusting every light that seemed to gild  The onward path, and feared to overlean  A finger even.
  And, though I have grown serene  And strong since then, I think that God has willed  A still renewable fear .
 .
 .
 O love, O troth .
 .
 .
  Lest these enclasped hands should never hold,  This mutual kiss drop down between us both  As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.
  And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,  Must lose one joy, by his life's star foretold.
          XXXVII      Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make  Of all that strong divineness which I know  For thine and thee, an image only so  Formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break.
  It is that distant years which did not take  Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,  Have forced my swimming brain to undergo  Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake  Thy purity of likeness and distort  Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit.
  As if a shipwrecked Pagan, safe in port,  His guardian sea-god to commemorate,  Should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort  And vibrant tail, within the temple-gate.
          XXXVIII      First time he kissed me, he but only kissed  The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;  And ever since, it grew more clean and white.
  Slow to world-greetings, quick with its "O, list,"  When the angels speak.
  A ring of amethyst  I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,  Than that first kiss.
  The second passed in height  The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,  Half falling on the hair.
  O beyond meed!  That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,  With sanctifying sweetness, did precede  The third upon my lips was folded down  In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,  I have been proud and said, "My love, my own.
"          XXXIX      Because thou hast the power and own'st the grace  To look through and behind this mask of me,  (Against which, years have beat thus blanchingly,  With their rains,) and behold my soul's true face,  The dim and weary witness of life's race,--  Because thou hast the faith and love to see,  Through that same soul's distracting lethargy,  The patient angel waiting for a place  In the new Heavens,--because nor sin nor woe,  Nor God's infliction, nor death's neighbourhood,  Nor all which others viewing, turn to go,  Nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,--  Nothing repels thee, .
 .
 .
 Dearest, teach me so  To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!          XL      Oh, yes! they love through all this world of ours!  I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth:  I have heard love talked in my early youth,  And since, not so long back but that the flowers  Then gathered, smell still.
  Mussulmans and Giaours  Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth  For any weeping.
  Polypheme's white tooth  Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,  The shell is over-smooth,--and not so much  Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate  Or else to oblivion.
  But thou art not such  A lover, my Beloved! thou canst wait  Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,  And think it soon when others cry "Too late.
"          XLI      I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,  With thanks and love from mine.
  Deep thanks to all  Who paused a little near the prison-wall  To hear my music in its louder parts  Ere they went onward, each one to the mart's  Or temple's occupation, beyond call.
  But thou, who, in my voice's sink and fall  When the sob took it, thy divinest Art's  Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot  To harken what I said between my tears, .
 .
 .
  Instruct me how to thank thee!  Oh, to shoot  My soul's full meaning into future years,  That they should lend it utterance, and salute  Love that endures, from life that disappears!          XLII      My future will not copy fair my past--  I wrote that once; and thinking at my side  My ministering life-angel justified  The word by his appealing look upcast  To the white throne of God, I turned at last,  And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied  To angels in thy soul!  Then I, long tried  By natural ills, received the comfort fast,  While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim's staff  Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled.
  I seek no copy now of life's first half:  Leave here the pages with long musing curled,  And write me new my future's epigraph,  New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!          XLIII      How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.
  I love thee to the depth and breadth and height  My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight  For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
  I love thee to the level of everyday's  Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
  I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;  I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
  I love thee with the passion put to use  In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
  I love thee with a love I seemed to lose  With my lost saints,--I love thee with the breath,  Smiles, tears, of all my life!--and, if God choose,  I shall but love thee better after death.
          XLIV      Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers  Plucked in the garden, all the summer through,  And winter, and it seemed as if they grew  In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.
  So, in the like name of that love of ours,  Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,  And which on warm and cold days I withdrew  From my heart's ground.
  Indeed, those beds and bowers  Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,  And wait thy weeding; yet here's eglantine,  Here's ivy!--take them, as I used to do  Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.
  Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,  And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine.

          AN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE PROGRESS OF OPINION ON THE ORIGIN OF  SPECIES,    PREVIOUSLY TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS WORK.
    I will here give a brief sketch of the progress of opinion on the Origin  of Species.
 Until recently the great majority of naturalists believed  that species were immutable productions, and had been separately  created.
 This view has been ably maintained by many authors.
 Some few  naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species undergo  modification, and that the existing forms of life are the descendants  by true generation of pre existing forms.
 Passing over allusions to  the subject in the classical writers (Aristotle, in his "Physicae  Auscultationes" (lib.
2, cap.
8, s.
2), after remarking that rain does not  fall in order to make the corn grow, any more than it falls to spoil the  farmer's corn when threshed out of doors, applies the same argument  to organisation; and adds (as translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first  pointed out the passage to me), "So what hinders the different parts (of  the body) from having this merely accidental relation in nature? as the  teeth, for example, grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted  for dividing, and the grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating  the food; since they were not made for the sake of this, but it was the  result of accident.
 And in like manner as to other parts in which there  appears to exist an adaptation to an end.
 Wheresoever, therefore, all  things together (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if  they were made for the sake of something, these were preserved,  having been appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and  whatsoever things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.
"  We here see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but  how little Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his  remarks on the formation of the teeth.
), the first author who in modern  times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.
 But as his  opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not  enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need  not here enter on details.
    Lamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much  attention.
 This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views  in 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his "Philosophie Zoologique",  and subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his "Hist.
 Nat.
 des  Animaux sans Vertebres".
 In these works he up holds the doctrine that  all species, including man, are descended from other species.
 He first  did the eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of  all change in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the  result of law, and not of miraculous interposition.
 Lamarck seems  to have been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of  species, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties,  by the almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by  the analogy of domestic productions.
 With respect to the means of  modification, he attributed something to the direct action of the  physical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already  existing forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of  habit.
 To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful  adaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for  browsing on the branches of trees.
 But he likewise believed in a law  of progressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to  progress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of  simple productions, he maintains that such forms are now spontaneously  generated.
 (I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck  from Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's ("Hist.
 Nat.
 Generale", tom.
 ii.
  page 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject.
 In  this work a full account is given of Buffon's conclusions on the same  subject.
 It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr.
 Erasmus Darwin,  anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in  his "Zoonomia" (vol.
 i.
 pages 500-510), published in 1794.
 According to  Isid.
 Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme partisan of  similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work written in 1794  and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he has pointedly  remarked ("Goethe als Naturforscher", von Dr.
 Karl Meding, s.
 34) that  the future question for naturalists will be how, for instance, cattle  got their horns and not for what they are used.
 It is rather a singular  instance of the manner in which similar views arise at about the same  time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr.
 Darwin in England, and Geoffroy  Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in France, came to the same  conclusion on the origin of species, in the years 1794-5.
)    Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his "Life", written by his  son, suspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various  degenerations of the same type.
 It was not until 1828 that he published  his conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since  the origin of all things.
 Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the  conditions of life, or the "monde ambiant" as the cause of change.
 He  was cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing  species are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, "C'est  donc un probleme a reserver entierement a l'avenir, suppose meme que  l'avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.
"    In 1813 Dr.
 W.
C.
 Wells read before the Royal Society "An Account of a  White Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro"; but his  paper was not published until his famous "Two Essays upon Dew and Single  Vision" appeared in 1818.
 In this paper he distinctly recognises the  principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which  has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man, and to  certain characters alone.
 After remarking that negroes and mulattoes  enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he observes, firstly,  that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and, secondly, that  agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by selection; and  then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case "by art, seems to  be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by nature, in the  formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the country which they  inhabit.
 Of the accidental varieties of man, which would occur among  the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle regions of Africa,  some one would be better fitted than others to bear the diseases of the  country.
 This race would consequently multiply, while the others would  decrease; not only from their in ability to sustain the attacks of  disease, but from their incapacity of contending with their more  vigorous neighbours.
 The colour of this vigorous race I take for  granted, from what has been already said, would be dark.
 But the same  disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a darker race  would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would be the best  fitted for the climate, this would at length become the most prevalent,  if not the only race, in the particular country in which it had  originated.
" He then extends these same views to the white inhabitants  of colder climates.
 I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the United States,  for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to the above passage  of Dr.
 Wells' work.
    The Hon.
 and Rev.
 W.
 Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the  fourth volume of the "Horticultural Transactions", 1822, and in his  work on the "Amaryllidaceae" (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that  "horticultural experiments have established, beyond the possibility of  refutation, that botanical species are only a higher and more permanent  class of varieties.
" He extends the same view to animals.
 The dean  believes that single species of each genus were created in an originally  highly plastic condition, and that these have produced, chiefly by  inter-crossing, but likewise by variation, all our existing species.
    In 1826 Professor Grant, in the concluding paragraph in his well-known  paper ("Edinburgh Philosophical Journal", vol.
 XIV, page 283) on the  Spongilla, clearly declares his belief that species are descended  from other species, and that they become improved in the course of  modification.
 This same view was given in his Fifty-fifth Lecture,  published in the "Lancet" in 1834.
    In 1831 Mr. Patrick Matthew published his work on "Naval Timber and  Arboriculture", in which he gives precisely the same view on the origin  of species as that (presently to be alluded to) propounded by Mr.  Wallace and myself in the "Linnean Journal", and as that enlarged in  the present volume.
 Unfortunately the view was given by Mr. Matthew very  briefly in scattered passages in an appendix to a work on a different  subject, so that it remained unnoticed until Mr. Matthew himself drew  attention to it in the "Gardeners' Chronicle", on April 7, 1860.
 The  differences of Mr. Matthew's views from mine are not of much importance:  he seems to consider that the world was nearly depopulated at successive  periods, and then restocked; and he gives as an alternative, that new  forms may be generated "without the presence of any mold or germ of  former aggregates.
" I am not sure that I understand some passages; but  it seems that he attributes much influence to the direct action of  the conditions of life.
 He clearly saw, however, the full force of the  principle of natural selection.
    The celebrated geologist and naturalist, Von Buch, in his excellent  "Description Physique des Isles Canaries" (1836, page 147), clearly  expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into permanent  species, which are no longer capable of intercrossing.
    Rafinesque, in his "New Flora of North America", published in 1836,  wrote (page 6) as follows: "All species might have been varieties once,  and many varieties are gradually becoming species by assuming constant  and peculiar characters;" but further on (page 18) he adds, "except the  original types or ancestors of the genus.
"    In 1843-44 Professor Haldeman ("Boston Journal of Nat.
 Hist.
 U.
 States",  vol.
 iv, page 468) has ably given the arguments for and against the  hypothesis of the development and modification of species: he seems to  lean toward the side of change.
    The "Vestiges of Creation" appeared in 1844.
 In the tenth and much  improved edition (1853) the anonymous author says (page 155): "The  proposition determined on after much consideration is, that the several  series of animated beings, from the simplest and oldest up to the  highest and most recent, are, under the providence of God, the results,  FIRST, of an impulse which has been imparted to the forms of life,  advancing them, in definite times, by generation, through grades of  organisation terminating in the highest dicotyledons and vertebrata,  these grades being few in number, and generally marked by intervals  of organic character, which we find to be a practical difficulty in  ascertaining affinities; SECOND, of another impulse connected with the  vital forces, tending, in the course of generations, to modify organic  structures in accordance with external circumstances, as food, the  nature of the habitat, and the meteoric agencies, these being the  'adaptations' of the natural theologian.
" The author apparently believes  that organisation progresses by sudden leaps, but that the effects  produced by the conditions of life are gradual.
 He argues with much  force on general grounds that species are not immutable productions.
  But I cannot see how the two supposed "impulses" account in a scientific  sense for the numerous and beautiful coadaptations which we see  throughout nature; I cannot see that we thus gain any insight how, for  instance, a woodpecker has become adapted to its peculiar habits of  life.
 The work, from its powerful and brilliant style, though displaying  in the early editions little accurate knowledge and a great want of  scientific caution, immediately had a very wide circulation.
 In my  opinion it has done excellent service in this country in calling  attention to the subject, in removing prejudice, and in thus preparing  the ground for the reception of analogous views.
    In 1846 the veteran geologist M.
J.
 d'Omalius d'Halloy published in an  excellent though short paper ("Bulletins de l'Acad.
 Roy.
 Bruxelles",  tom.
 xiii, page 581) his opinion that it is more probable that new  species have been produced by descent with modification than that they  have been separately created: the author first promulgated this opinion  in 1831.
    Professor Owen, in 1849 ("Nature of Limbs", page 86), wrote as follows:  "The archetypal idea was manifested in the flesh under diverse such  modifications, upon this planet, long prior to the existence of those  animal species that actually exemplify it.
 To what natural laws or  secondary causes the orderly succession and progression of such organic  phenomena may have been committed, we, as yet, are ignorant.
" In his  address to the British Association, in 1858, he speaks (page li) of "the  axiom of the continuous operation of creative power, or of the ordained  becoming of living things.
" Further on (page xc), after referring  to geographical distribution, he adds, "These phenomena shake our  confidence in the conclusion that the Apteryx of New Zealand and the  Red Grouse of England were distinct creations in and for those islands  respectively.
 Always, also, it may be well to bear in mind that by the  word 'creation' the zoologist means 'a process he knows not what.
'" He  amplifies this idea by adding that when such cases as that of the Red  Grouse are "enumerated by the zoologist as evidence of distinct creation  of the bird in and for such islands, he chiefly expresses that he  knows not how the Red Grouse came to be there, and there exclusively;  signifying also, by this mode of expressing such ignorance, his belief  that both the bird and the islands owed their origin to a great first  Creative Cause.
" If we interpret these sentences given in the same  address, one by the other, it appears that this eminent philosopher felt  in 1858 his confidence shaken that the Apteryx and the Red Grouse first  appeared in their respective homes "he knew not how," or by some process  "he knew not what.
"    This address was delivered after the papers by Mr. Wallace and myself on  the Origin of Species, presently to be referred to, had been read before  the Linnean Society.
 When the first edition of this work was published,  I was so completely deceived, as were many others, by such expressions  as "the continuous operation of creative power," that I included  Professor Owen with other palaeontologists as being firmly convinced  of the immutability of species; but it appears ("Anat.
 of Vertebrates",  vol.
 iii, page 796) that this was on my part a preposterous error.
 In  the last edition of this work I inferred, and the inference still seems  to me perfectly just, from a passage beginning with the words "no doubt  the type-form," etc.
(Ibid.
, vol.
 i, page xxxv), that Professor Owen  admitted that natural selection may have done something in the formation  of a new species; but this it appears (Ibid.
, vol.
 iii.
 page 798)  is inaccurate and without evidence.
 I also gave some extracts from a  correspondence between Professor Owen and the editor of the "London  Review", from which it appeared manifest to the editor as well as to  myself, that Professor Owen claimed to have promulgated the theory of  natural selection before I had done so; and I expressed my surprise  and satisfaction at this announcement; but as far as it is possible to  understand certain recently published passages (Ibid.
, vol.
 iii.
 page  798) I have either partially or wholly again fallen into error.
 It  is consolatory to me that others find Professor Owen's controversial  writings as difficult to understand and to reconcile with each other,  as I do.
 As far as the mere enunciation of the principle of natural  selection is concerned, it is quite immaterial whether or not Professor  Owen preceded me, for both of us, as shown in this historical sketch,  were long ago preceded by Dr.
 Wells and Mr. Matthews.
    M.
 Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in his lectures delivered in 1850 (of  which a Resume appeared in the "Revue et Mag.
 de Zoolog.
", Jan.
, 1851),  briefly gives his reason for believing that specific characters "sont  fixes, pour chaque espece, tant qu'elle se perpetue au milieu des memes  circonstances: ils se modifient, si les circonstances ambiantes viennent  a changer.
 En resume, L'OBSERVATION des animaux sauvages demontre deja  la variabilite LIMITEE des especes.
 Les EXPERIENCES sur les animaux  sauvages devenus domestiques, et sur les animaux domestiques redevenus  sauvages, la demontrent plus clairment encore.
 Ces memes experiences  prouvent, de plus, que les differences produites peuvent etre de VALEUR  GENERIQUE.
" In his "Hist.
 Nat.
 Generale" (tom.
 ii, page 430, 1859) he  amplifies analogous conclusions.
    From a circular lately issued it appears that Dr.
 Freke, in 1851  ("Dublin Medical Press", page 322), propounded the doctrine that all  organic beings have descended from one primordial form.
 His grounds of  belief and treatment of the subject are wholly different from mine;  but as Dr.
 Freke has now (1861) published his Essay on the "Origin of  Species by means of Organic Affinity", the difficult attempt to give any  idea of his views would be superfluous on my part.
    Mr. Herbert Spencer, in an Essay (originally published in the "Leader",  March, 1852, and republished in his "Essays", in 1858), has contrasted  the theories of the Creation and the Development of organic beings  with remarkable skill and force.
 He argues from the analogy of domestic  productions, from the changes which the embryos of many species undergo,  from the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, and from  the principle of general gradation, that species have been modified;  and he attributes the modification to the change of circumstances.
  The author (1855) has also treated Psychology on the principle of the  necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.
    In 1852 M.
 Naudin, a distinguished botanist, expressly stated, in an  admirable paper on the Origin of Species ("Revue Horticole", page 102;  since partly republished in the "Nouvelles Archives du Museum", tom.
 i,  page 171), his belief that species are formed in an analogous manner as  varieties are under cultivation; and the latter process he attributes to  man's power of selection.
 But he does not show how selection acts under  nature.
 He believes, like Dean Herbert, that species, when nascent,  were more plastic than at present.
 He lays weight on what he calls the  principle of finality, "puissance mysterieuse, indeterminee; fatalite  pour les uns; pour les autres volonte providentielle, dont l'action  incessante sur les etres vivantes determine, a toutes les epoques de  l'existence du monde, la forme, le volume, et la duree de chacun d'eux,  en raison de sa destinee dans l'ordre de choses dont il fait partie.
  C'est cette puissance qui harmonise chaque membre a l'ensemble, en  l'appropriant a la fonction qu'il doit remplir dans l'organisme general  de la nature, fonction qui est pour lui sa raison d'etre.
" (From  references in Bronn's "Untersuchungen uber die Entwickelungs-Gesetze",  it appears that the celebrated botanist and palaeontologist Unger  published, in 1852, his belief that species undergo development and  modification.
 Dalton, likewise, in Pander and Dalton's work on Fossil  Sloths, expressed, in 1821, a similar belief.
 Similar views have, as is  well known, been maintained by Oken in his mystical "Natur-Philosophie".
  From other references in Godron's work "Sur l'Espece", it seems that  Bory St.
 Vincent, Burdach, Poiret and Fries, have all admitted that  new species are continually being produced.
 I may add, that of the  thirty-four authors named in this Historical Sketch, who believe in  the modification of species, or at least disbelieve in separate acts  of creation, twenty-seven have written on special branches of natural  history or geology.
)    In 1853 a celebrated geologist, Count Keyserling ("Bulletin de la Soc.
  Geolog.
", 2nd Ser.
, tom.
 x, page 357), suggested that as new diseases,  supposed to have been caused by some miasma have arisen and spread over  the world, so at certain periods the germs of existing species may have  been chemically affected by circumambient molecules of a particular  nature, and thus have given rise to new forms.
    In this same year, 1853, Dr.
 Schaaffhausen published an excellent  pamphlet ("Verhand.
 des Naturhist.
 Vereins der Preuss.
 Rheinlands",  etc.
), in which he maintains the development of organic forms on the  earth.
 He infers that many species have kept true for long periods,  whereas a few have become modified.
 The distinction of species he  explains by the destruction of intermediate graduated forms.
 "Thus  living plants and animals are not separated from the extinct by new  creations, but are to be regarded as their descendants through continued  reproduction.
"    A well-known French botanist, M.
 Lecoq, writes in 1854 ("Etudes sur  Geograph.
" Bot.
 tom.
 i, page 250), "On voit que nos recherches sur la  fixite ou la variation de l'espece, nous conduisent directement aux  idees emises par deux hommes justement celebres, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire  et Goethe.
" Some other passages scattered through M.
 Lecoq's large  work make it a little doubtful how far he extends his views on the  modification of species.
    The "Philosophy of Creation" has been treated in a masterly manner by  the Rev.
 Baden Powell, in his "Essays on the Unity of Worlds", 1855.
  Nothing can be more striking than the manner in which he shows that the  introduction of new species is "a regular, not a casual phenomenon," or,  as Sir John Herschel expresses it, "a natural in contradistinction to a  miraculous process.
"    The third volume of the "Journal of the Linnean Society" contains  papers, read July 1, 1858, by Mr. Wallace and myself, in which, as  stated in the introductory remarks to this volume, the theory of  Natural Selection is promulgated by Mr. Wallace with admirable force and  clearness.
    Von Baer, toward whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect,  expressed about the year 1859 (see Prof.
 Rudolph Wagner,  "Zoologisch-Anthropologische Untersuchungen", 1861, s.
 51) his  conviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution,  that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single  parent-form.
    In June, 1859, Professor Huxley gave a lecture before the Royal  Institution on the "Persistent Types of Animal Life".
 Referring to such  cases, he remarks, "It is difficult to comprehend the meaning of such  facts as these, if we suppose that each species of animal and plant, or  each great type of organisation, was formed and placed upon the surface  of the globe at long intervals by a distinct act of creative power; and  it is well to recollect that such an assumption is as unsupported by  tradition or revelation as it is opposed to the general analogy of  nature.
 If, on the other hand, we view "Persistent Types" in relation to  that hypothesis which supposes the species living at any time to be the  result of the gradual modification of pre-existing species, a hypothesis  which, though unproven, and sadly damaged by some of its supporters,  is yet the only one to which physiology lends any countenance; their  existence would seem to show that the amount of modification which  living beings have undergone during geological time is but very small in  relation to the whole series of changes which they have suffered.
"    In December, 1859, Dr.
 Hooker published his "Introduction to the  Australian Flora".
 In the first part of this great work he admits the  truth of the descent and modification of species, and supports this  doctrine by many original observations.
    The first edition of this work was published on November 24, 1859, and  the second edition on January 7, 1860.

          ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
          INTRODUCTION.
    When on board H.
M.
S.
 Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with  certain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting South  America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past  inhabitants of that continent.
 These facts, as will be seen in the  latter chapters of this volume, seemed to throw some light on the origin  of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one  of our greatest philosophers.
 On my return home, it occurred to me,  in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by  patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could  possibly have any bearing on it.
 After five years' work I allowed myself  to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I  enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to  me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued  the same object.
 I hope that I may be excused for entering on these  personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in  coming to a decision.
    My work is now (1859) nearly finished; but as it will take me many more  years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been  urged to publish this abstract.
 I have more especially been induced to  do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of  the Malay Archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general  conclusions that I have on the origin of species.
 In 1858 he sent me a  memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to Sir  Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published  in the third volume of the Journal of that Society.
 Sir C.
 Lyell and Dr.
  Hooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having read my sketch  of 1844--honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr.  Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.
    This abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect.
 I  cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements;  and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy.
  No doubt errors may have crept in, though I hope I have always been  cautious in trusting to good authorities alone.
 I can here give only  the general conclusions at which I have arrived, with a few facts in  illustration, but which, I hope, in most cases will suffice.
 No one can  feel more sensible than I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in  detail all the facts, with references, on which my conclusions have been  grounded; and I hope in a future work to do this.
 For I am well aware  that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts  cannot be adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions directly  opposite to those at which I have arrived.
 A fair result can be obtained  only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both  sides of each question; and this is here impossible.
    I much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of  acknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very  many naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me.
 I cannot,  however, let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep  obligations to Dr.
 Hooker, who, for the last fifteen years, has aided me  in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent  judgment.
    In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a  naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings,  on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution,  geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the  conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had  descended, like varieties, from other species.
 Nevertheless, such a  conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it  could be shown how the innumerable species, inhabiting this world  have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure  and coadaptation which justly excites our admiration.
 Naturalists  continually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, etc.
,  as the only possible cause of variation.
 In one limited sense, as  we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to  attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance,  of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably  adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees.
 In the case of the  mistletoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which has  seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers  with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects  to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally preposterous  to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to  several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions,  or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself.
    It is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into  the means of modification and coadaptation.
 At the commencement of  my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of  domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best  chance of making out this obscure problem.
 Nor have I been disappointed;  in this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that  our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication,  afforded the best and safest clue.
 I may venture to express my  conviction of the high value of such studies, although they have been  very commonly neglected by naturalists.
    From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this  abstract to variation under domestication.
 We shall thus see that a  large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible; and, what  is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man  in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations.
 I will  then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but  I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too  briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of  facts.
 We shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances  are most favourable to variation.
 In the next chapter the struggle  for existence among all organic beings throughout the world, which  inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their increase,  will be considered.
 This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the  whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.
 As many more individuals of each  species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there  is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any  being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself,  under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have  a better chance of surviving, and thus be NATURALLY SELECTED.
 From  the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to  propagate its new and modified form.
    This fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at  some length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how natural  selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved  forms of life, and leads to what I have called divergence of character.
  In the next  shall discuss the complex and little known laws  of variation.
 In the five succeeding chapters, the most apparent and  gravest difficulties in accepting the theory will be given: namely,  first, the difficulties of transitions, or how a simple being or a  simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed  being or into an elaborately constructed organ; secondly the subject of  instinct, or the mental powers of animals; thirdly, hybridism, or the  infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed;  and fourthly, the imperfection of the geological record.
 In the next   shall consider the geological succession of organic beings  throughout time; in the twelfth and thirteenth, their geographical  distribution throughout space; in the fourteenth, their classification  or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an embryonic condition.
 In  the last  shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work,  and a few concluding remarks.
    No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in  regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he make due allowance  for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of the  many beings which live around us.
 Who can explain why one species ranges  widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow  range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest importance,  for they determine the present welfare and, as I believe, the future  success and modification of every inhabitant of this world.
 Still less  do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the  world during the many past geological epochs in its history.
 Although  much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no  doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of  which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists until recently  entertained, and which I formerly entertained--namely, that each species  has been independently created--is erroneous.
 I am fully convinced that  species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called  the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally  extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of  any one species are the descendants of that species.
 Furthermore, I am  convinced that natural selection has been the most important, but not  the exclusive, means of modification.

 VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.
     Causes of Variability--Effects of Habit and the use and disuse of   Parts--Correlated Variation--Inheritance--Character of Domestic   Varieties--Difficulty of distinguishing between Varieties and   Species--Origin of Domestic Varieties from one or more Species--Domestic   Pigeons, their Differences and Origin--Principles of Selection,   anciently followed, their Effects--Methodical and Unconscious   Selection--Unknown Origin of our Domestic Productions--Circumstances   favourable to Man's power of Selection.
      CAUSES OF VARIABILITY.
    When we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of  our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which  strikes us is, that they generally differ more from each other than do  the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature.
 And  if we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have  been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most  different climates and treatment, we are driven to conclude that this  great variability is due to our domestic productions having been raised  under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from,  those to which the parent species had been exposed under nature.
 There  is, also, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that  this variability may be partly connected with excess of food.
 It seems  clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to  new conditions to cause any great amount of variation; and that, when  the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues varying  for many generations.
 No case is on record of a variable organism  ceasing to vary under cultivation.
 Our oldest cultivated plants, such  as wheat, still yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are  still capable of rapid improvement or modification.
    As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the  conditions of life appear to act in two ways--directly on the whole  organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the  reproductive system.
 With respect to the direct action, we must bear in  mind that in every case, as Professor Weismann has lately insisted,  and as I have incidently shown in my work on "Variation under  Domestication," there are two factors: namely, the nature of the  organism and the nature of the conditions.
 The former seems to be much  the more important; for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under,  as far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and, on the other hand,  dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be  nearly uniform.
 The effects on the offspring are either definite or in  definite.
 They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the  offspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several  generations are modified in the same manner.
 It is extremely difficult  to come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which  have been thus definitely induced.
 There can, however, be little doubt  about many slight changes, such as size from the amount of food,  colour from the nature of the food, thickness of the skin and hair from  climate, etc.
 Each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage  of our fowls must have had some efficient cause; and if the same cause  were to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many  individuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner.
 Such  facts as the complex and extraordinary out growths which variably  follow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a gall-producing  insect, shows us what singular modifications might result in the case of  plants from a chemical change in the nature of the sap.
    In definite variability is a much more common result of changed  conditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more  important part in the formation of our domestic races.
 We see in  definite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which  distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be  accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote  ancestor.
 Even strongly-marked differences occasionally appear in the  young of the same litter, and in seedlings from the same seed-capsule.
  At long intervals of time, out of millions of individuals reared in the  same country and fed on nearly the same food, deviations of structure so  strongly pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise; but  monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line from slighter  variations.
 All such changes of structure, whether extremely slight or  strongly marked, which appear among many individuals living together,  may be considered as the in definite effects of the conditions of life  on each individual organism, in nearly the same manner as the chill  effects different men in an in definite manner, according to their  state of body or constitution, causing coughs or colds, rheumatism, or  inflammation of various organs.
    With respect to what I have called the in direct action of changed  conditions, namely, through the reproductive system of being affected,  we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of  this system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions,  and partly from the similarity, as Kolreuter and others have remarked,  between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct  species, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when  reared under new or unnatural conditions.
 Many facts clearly show how  eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes  in the surrounding conditions.
 Nothing is more easy than to tame an  animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely  under confinement, even when the male and female unite.
 How many animals  there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in  their native country! This is generally, but erroneously attributed to  vitiated instincts.
 Many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour,  and yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has been discovered  that a very trifling change, such as a little more or less water at some  particular period of growth, will determine whether or not a plant will  produce seeds.
 I cannot here give the details which I have collected and  elsewhere published on this curious subject; but to show how singular  the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under  confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even from the  tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with  the exception of the plantigrades or bear family, which seldom produce  young; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exception, hardly  ever lay fertile eggs.
 Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless,  in the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids.
 When, on the one  hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and  sickly, breeding freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand,  we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature perfectly  tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous  instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected  by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not be surprised at  this system, when it does act under confinement, acting irregularly,  and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents.
 I may add that  as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions--for  instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches--showing that their  reproductive organs are not easily affected; so will some animals  and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very  slightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.
    Some naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with  the act of sexual reproduction; but this is certainly an error; for I  have given in another work a long list of "sporting plants;" as they are  called by gardeners; that is, of plants which have suddenly produced a  single bud with a new and sometimes widely different character from that  of the other buds on the same plant.
 These bud variations, as they may  be named, can be propagated by grafts, offsets, etc.
, and sometimes  by seed.
 They occur rarely under nature, but are far from rare under  culture.
 As a single bud out of many thousands produced year after year  on the same tree under uniform conditions, has been known suddenly to  assume a new character; and as buds on distinct trees, growing  under different conditions, have sometimes yielded nearly the same  variety--for instance, buds on peach-trees producing nectarines, and  buds on common roses producing moss-roses--we clearly see that the  nature of the conditions is of subordinate importance in comparison  with the nature of the organism in determining each particular form of  variation; perhaps of not more importance than the nature of the spark,  by which a mass of combustible matter is ignited, has in determining the  nature of the flames.
    EFFECTS OF HABIT AND OF THE USE OR DISUSE OF PARTS; CORRELATED  VARIATION; INHERITANCE.
    Changed habits produce an inherited effect as in the period of the  flowering of plants when transported from one climate to another.
 With  animals the increased use or disuse of parts has had a more marked  influence; thus I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing  weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole  skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild duck; and this change may  be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking  more, than its wild parents.
 The great and inherited development of the  udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked,  in comparison with these organs in other countries, is probably another  instance of the effects of use.
 Not one of our domestic animals can be  named which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view which  has been suggested that the drooping is due to disuse of the muscles of  the ear, from the animals being seldom much alarmed, seems probable.
    Many laws regulate variation, some few of which can be dimly seen, and  will hereafter be briefly discussed.
 I will here only allude to what may  be called correlated variation.
 Important changes in the embryo or larva  will probably entail changes in the mature animal.
 In monstrosities,  the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many  instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St.
 Hilaire's great work on this  subject.
 Breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied  by an elongated head.
 Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical;  thus cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally  deaf; but it has been lately stated by Mr. Tait that this is confined to  the males.
 Colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which  many remarkable cases could be given among animals and plants.
 From  facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs  are injured by certain plants, while dark-coloured individuals escape:  Professor Wyman has recently communicated to me a good illustration of  this fact; on asking some farmers in Virginia how it was that all their  pigs were black, they informed him that the pigs ate the paint-root  (Lachnanthes), which coloured their bones pink, and which caused  the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off; and one of the  "crackers" (i.
e.
 Virginia squatters) added, "we select the black members  of a litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living.
"  Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired  animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons  with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with  short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet.
 Hence  if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will  almost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure,  owing to the mysterious laws of correlation.
    The results of the various, unknown, or but dimly understood laws of  variation are infinitely complex and diversified.
 It is well worth while  carefully to study the several treatises on some of our old cultivated  plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, etc.
; and it  is really surprising to note the endless points of structure and  constitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly  from each other.
 The whole organisation seems to have become plastic,  and departs in a slight degree from that of the parental type.
    Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us.
 But the  number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both  those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance,  are endless.
 Dr.
 Prosper Lucas' treatise, in two large volumes, is the  fullest and the best on this subject.
 No breeder doubts how strong is  the tendency to inheritance; that like produces like is his fundamental  belief: doubts have been thrown on this principle only by theoretical  writers.
 When any deviation of structure often appears, and we see it  in the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the  same cause having acted on both; but when among individuals, apparently  exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some  extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say,  once among several million individuals--and it reappears in the  child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute  its reappearance to inheritance.
 Every one must have heard of cases of  albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc.
, appearing in several members  of the same family.
 If strange and rare deviations of structure are  truly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely  admitted to be inheritable.
 Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole  subject would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever  as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.
    The laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown; no one  can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same  species, or in different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes  not so; why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its  grandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is  often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone,  more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex.
 It is a fact of  some importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our  domestic breeds are often transmitted, either exclusively or in a much  greater degree, to the males alone.
 A much more important rule, which I  think may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity  first appears, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding  age, though sometimes earlier.
 In many cases this could not be  otherwise; thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could  appear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the  silk-worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon  stage.
 But hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe  that the rule has a wider extension, and that, when there is no apparent  reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that  it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it  first appeared in the parent.
 I believe this rule to be of the highest  importance in explaining the laws of embryology.
 These remarks are of  course confined to the first APPEARANCE of the peculiarity, and not  to the primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or on the male  element; in nearly the same manner as the increased length of the horns  in the offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, though  appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male element.
    Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to  a statement often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic  varieties, when run wild, gradually but invariably revert in character  to their aboriginal stocks.
 Hence it has been argued that no deductions  can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature.
 I  have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above  statement has so often and so boldly been made.
 There would be great  difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many  of the most strongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live  in a wild state.
 In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock  was, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion  had ensued.
 It would be necessary, in order to prevent the effects of  intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in  its new home.
 Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally  revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me  not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to  cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance,  of the cabbage, in very poor soil--in which case, however, some  effect would have to be attributed to the DEFINITE action of the poor  soil--that they would, to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the  wild aboriginal stock.
 Whether or not the experiment would succeed is  not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment  itself the conditions of life are changed.
 If it could be shown that our  domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion--that is,  to lose their acquired characters, while kept under the same conditions  and while kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might  check, by blending together, any slight deviations in their structure,  in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic  varieties in regard to species.
 But there is not a shadow of evidence  in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart  and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various  breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an unlimited number of generations,  would be opposed to all experience.
    CHARACTER OF DOMESTIC VARIETIES; DIFFICULTY OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN  VARIETIES AND SPECIES; ORIGIN OF DOMESTIC VARIETIES FROM ONE OR MORE  SPECIES.
    When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic  animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we  generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less  uniformity of character than in true species.
 Domestic races often  have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although  differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in  several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in  some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially  when compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest  allied.
 With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of  varieties when crossed--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic  races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as  do the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature,  but the differences in most cases are less in degree.
 This must be  admitted as true, for the domestic races of many animals and plants have  been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally  distinct species, and by other competent judges as mere varieties.
  If any well marked distinction existed between a domestic race and a  species, this source of doubt would not so perpetually recur.
 It has  often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in  characters of generic value.
 It can be shown that this statement is not  correct; but naturalists differ much in determining what characters are  of generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical.
 When  it is explained how genera originate under nature, it will be seen that  we have no right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference  in our domesticated races.
    In attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference between  allied domestic races, we are soon involved in doubt, from not knowing  whether they are descended from one or several parent species.
 This  point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for  instance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier,  spaniel and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind truly, were  the offspring of any single species, then such facts would have great  weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many closely  allied natural species--for instance, of the many foxes--inhabiting the  different quarters of the world.
 I do not believe, as we shall presently  see, that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of  the dog has been produced under domestication; I believe that a small  part of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct  species.
 In the case of strongly marked races of some other domesticated  species, there is presumptive or even strong evidence that all are  descended from a single wild stock.
    It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals  and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and  likewise to withstand diverse climates.
 I do not dispute that these  capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated  productions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed  an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether  it would endure other climates? Has the little variability of the ass  and goose, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer,  or of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication? I  cannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our  domesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and  countries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed  for an equal number of generations under domestication, they would on  an average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing  domesticated productions have varied.
    In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants,  it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they are  descended from one or several wild species.
 The argument mainly relied  on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals  is, that we find in the most ancient times, on the monuments of Egypt,  and in the lake-habitations of Switzerland, much diversity in the  breeds; and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble, or are  even identical with, those still existing.
 But this only throws far  backward the history of civilisation, and shows that animals were  domesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed.
  The lake-inhabitants of Switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat  and barley, the pea, the poppy for oil and flax; and they possessed  several domesticated animals.
 They also carried on commerce with other  nations.
 All this clearly shows, as Heer has remarked, that they had at  this early age progressed considerably in civilisation; and this again  implies a long continued previous period of less advanced civilisation,  during which the domesticated animals, kept by different tribes in  different districts, might have varied and given rise to distinct races.
  Since the discovery of flint tools in the superficial formations of many  parts of the world, all geologists believe that barbarian men existed at  an enormously remote period; and we know that at the present day there  is hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the  dog.
    The origin of most of our domestic animals will probably forever remain  vague.
 But I may here state that, looking to the domestic dogs of the  whole world, I have, after a laborious collection of all known facts,  come to the conclusion that several wild species of Canidae have been  tamed, and that their blood, in some cases mingled together, flows in  the veins of our domestic breeds.
 In regard to sheep and goats I can  form no decided opinion.
 From facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth,  on the habits, voice, constitution and structure of the humped Indian  cattle, it is almost certain that they are descended from a different  aboriginal stock from our European cattle; and some competent judges  believe that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors,  whether or not these deserve to be called species.
 This conclusion, as  well as that of the specific distinction between the humped and common  cattle, may, indeed, be looked upon as established by the admirable  researches of Professor Rutimeyer.
 With respect to horses, from reasons  which I cannot here give, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in  opposition to several authors, that all the races belong to the same  species.
 Having kept nearly all the English breeds of the fowl alive,  having bred and crossed them, and examined their skeletons, it appears  to me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild Indian  fowl, Gallus bankiva; and this is the conclusion of Mr. Blyth, and  of others who have studied this bird in India.
 In regard to ducks and  rabbits, some breeds of which differ much from each other, the evidence  is clear that they are all descended from the common duck and wild  rabbit.
    The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several  aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some  authors.
 They believe that every race which breeds true, let the  distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype.
  At this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild  cattle, as many sheep, and several goats, in Europe alone, and several  even within Great Britain.
 One author believes that there formerly  existed eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to Great Britain! When we  bear in mind that Britain has now not one peculiar mammal, and France  but few distinct from those of Germany, and so with Hungary, Spain,  etc.
, but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds  of cattle, sheep, etc.
, we must admit that many domestic breeds must  have originated in Europe; for whence otherwise could they have been  derived? So it is in India.
 Even in the case of the breeds of the  domestic dog throughout the world, which I admit are descended from  several wild species, it cannot be doubted that there has been an  immense amount of inherited variation; for who will believe that animals  closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog,  pug-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.
--so unlike all wild Canidae--ever  existed in a state of nature? It has often been loosely said that all  our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few  aboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree  intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several  domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence of  the most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog,  etc.
, in the wild state.
 Moreover, the possibility of making distinct  races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated.
 Many cases are on record  showing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided  by the careful selection of the individuals which present the desired  character; but to obtain a race intermediate between two quite distinct  races would be very difficult.
 Sir J.
 Sebright expressly experimented  with this object and failed.
 The offspring from the first cross between  two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with  pigeons) quite uniform in character, and every thing seems simple  enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several  generations, hardly two of them are alike, and then the difficulty of  the task becomes manifest.
    BREEDS OF THE DOMESTIC PIGEON, THEIR DIFFERENCES AND ORIGIN.
    Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have,  after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons.
 I have kept every breed  which I could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured  with skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the  Hon.
 W.
 Elliot from India, and by the Hon.
 C.
 Murray from Persia.
 Many  treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons, and  some of them are very important, as being of considerable antiquity.
 I  have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted  to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs.
 The diversity of the breeds is  something astonishing.
 Compare the English carrier and the short-faced  tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing  corresponding differences in their skulls.
 The carrier, more especially  the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the  carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly  elongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a  wide gape of mouth.
 The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost  like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited  habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in  the air head over heels.
 The runt is a bird of great size, with long,  massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very  long necks, others very long wings and tails, others singularly short  tails.
 The barb is allied to the carrier, but, instead of a long beak,  has a very short and broad one.
 The pouter has a much elongated body,  wings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop, which it glories in  inflating, may well excite astonishment and even laughter.
 The turbit  has a short and conical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the  breast; and it has the habit of continually expanding, slightly, the  upper part of the oesophagus.
 The Jacobin has the feathers so much  reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood, and it  has, proportionally to its size, elongated wing and tail feathers.
 The  trumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a very different  coo from the other breeds.
 The fantail has thirty or even forty  tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal number in all  the members of the great pigeon family: these feathers are kept expanded  and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch: the  oil-gland is quite aborted.
 Several other less distinct breeds might be  specified.
    In the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of  the face, in length and breadth and curvature, differs enormously.
 The  shape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw,  varies in a highly remarkable manner.
 The caudal and sacral vertebrae  vary in number; as does the number of the ribs, together with their  relative breadth and the presence of processes.
 The size and shape of  the apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree  of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula.
 The  proportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the  eyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in  strict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and  of the upper part of the oesophagus; the development and abortion of  the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the  relative length of the wing and tail to each other and to the body;  the relative length of the leg and foot; the number of scutellae on  the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of  structure which are variable.
 The period at which the perfect plumage is  acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling  birds are clothed when hatched.
 The shape and size of the eggs vary.
 The  manner of flight, and in some breeds the voice and disposition, differ  remarkably.
 Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have come  to differ in a slight degree from each other.
    Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which, if shown  to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would  certainly be ranked by him as well-defined species.
 Moreover, I do not  believe that any ornithologist would in this case place the English  carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and  fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds  several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species, as he would call them,  could be shown him.
    Great as are the differences between the breeds of the pigeon, I am  fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct,  namely, that all are descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia),  including under this term several geographical races or sub-species,  which differ from each other in the most trifling respects.
 As several  of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree  applicable in other cases, I will here briefly give them.
 If the several  breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon,  they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks;  for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing  of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced  by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the  characteristic enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all  have been rock-pigeons, that is, they did not breed or willingly perch  on trees.
 But besides C.
 livia, with its geographical sub-species, only  two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have  not any of the characters of the domestic breeds.
 Hence the supposed  aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they  were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and  this, considering their size, habits and remarkable characters, seems  improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state.
 But  birds breeding on precipices, and good flyers, are unlikely to be  exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with  the domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the  smaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean.
 Hence the  supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with  the rock-pigeon seems a very rash assumption.
 Moreover, the several  above-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of  the world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back  again into their native country; but not one has become wild or feral,  though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly  altered state, has become feral in several places.
 Again, all recent  experience shows that it is difficult to get wild animals to breed  freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin  of our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species  were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man,  as to be quite prolific under confinement.
    An argument of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, is,  that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally with the wild  rock-pigeon in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts  of their structure, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts; we  may look in vain through the whole great family of Columbidae for a beak  like that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or  barb; for reversed feathers like those of the Jacobin; for a crop like  that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail.
 Hence  it must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man succeeded in  thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or  by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that  these very species have since all become extinct or unknown.
 So many  strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree.
    Some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve  consideration.
 The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, with white loins;  but the Indian sub-species, C.
 intermedia of Strickland, has this  part bluish.
 The tail has a terminal dark bar, with the outer feathers  externally edged at the base with white.
 The wings have two black bars.
  Some semi-domestic breeds, and some truly wild breeds, have, besides the  two black bars, the wings chequered with black.
 These several marks do  not occur together in any other species of the whole family.
 Now, in  every one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all  the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers,  sometimes concur perfectly developed.
 Moreover, when birds belonging to  two or more distinct breeds are crossed, none of which are blue or have  any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt  suddenly to acquire these characters.
 To give one instance out of  several which I have observed: I crossed some white fantails, which  breed very true, with some black barbs--and it so happens that blue  varieties of barbs are so rare that I never heard of an instance in  England; and the mongrels were black, brown and mottled.
 I also crossed  a barb with a spot, which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot  on the forehead, and which notoriously breeds very true; the mongrels  were dusky and mottled.
 I then crossed one of the mongrel barb-fantails  with a mongrel barb-spot, and they produced a bird of as beautiful a  blue colour, with the white loins, double black wing-bar, and barred and  white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand  these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to ancestral  characters, if all the domestic breeds are descended from the  rock-pigeon.
 But if we deny this, we must make one of the two following  highly improbable suppositions.
 Either, first, that all the several  imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the  rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and  marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to  revert to the very same colours and markings.
 Or, secondly, that each  breed, even the purest, has within a dozen, or at most within a score,  of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen  or twenty generations, for no instance is known of crossed descendants  reverting to an ancestor of foreign blood, removed by a greater number  of generations.
 In a breed which has been crossed only once the tendency  to revert to any character derived from such a cross will naturally  become less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be  less of the foreign blood; but when there has been no cross, and there  is a tendency in the breed to revert to a character which was lost  during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to  the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite  number of generations.
 These two distinct cases of reversion are often  confounded together by those who have written on inheritance.
    Lastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the breeds of the  pigeon are perfectly fertile, as I can state from my own observations,  purposely made, on the most distinct breeds.
 Now, hardly any cases  have been ascertained with certainty of hybrids from two quite distinct  species of animals being perfectly fertile.
 Some authors believe  that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to  sterility in species.
 From the history of the dog, and of some other  domestic animals, this conclusion is probably quite correct, if applied  to species closely related to each other.
 But to extend it so far as to  suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers,  pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile,  inter se, seems to me rash in the extreme.
    From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having  formerly made seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely  under domestication--these supposed species being quite unknown in a  wild state, and their not having become anywhere feral--these species  presenting certain very abnormal characters, as compared with all other  Columbidae, though so like the rock-pigeon in most other respects--the  occasional reappearance of the blue colour and various black marks in  all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed--and lastly, the  mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile--from these several reasons,  taken together, we may safely conclude that all our domestic breeds are  descended from the rock-pigeon or Columba livia with its geographical  sub-species.
    In favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that the wild C.
 livia has  been found capable of domestication in Europe and in India; and that it  agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all  the domestic breeds.
 Secondly, that although an English carrier or a  short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the  rock-pigeon, yet that by comparing the several sub-breeds of these two  races, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can  make, between them and the rock-pigeon, an almost perfect series; so  we can in some other cases, but not with all the breeds.
 Thirdly,  those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed are in each  eminently variable, for instance, the wattle and length of beak of  the carrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of  tail-feathers in the fantail; and the explanation of this fact will be  obvious when we treat of selection.
 Fourthly, pigeons have been watched  and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many people.
 They have  been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the  world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth Aegyptian  dynasty, about 3000 B.
C.
, as was pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius;  but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in  the previous dynasty.
 In the time of the Romans, as we hear from Pliny,  immense prices were given for pigeons; "nay, they are come to this pass,  that they can reckon up their pedigree and race.
" Pigeons were much  valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year 1600; never less than  20,000 pigeons were taken with the court.
 "The monarchs of Iran and  Turan sent him some very rare birds;" and, continues the courtly  historian, "His Majesty, by crossing the breeds, which method was never  practised before, has improved them astonishingly.
" About this same  period the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old Romans.
 The  paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense  amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will likewise be  obvious when we treat of selection.
 We shall then, also, see how it is  that the several breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character.
  It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct  breeds, that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and  thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.
    I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some,  yet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and  watched the several kinds, well knowing how truly they breed, I  felt fully as much difficulty in believing that since they had been  domesticated they had all proceeded from a common parent, as any  naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the  many species of finches, or other groups of birds, in nature.
 One  circumstance has struck me much; namely, that nearly all the breeders of  the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom  I have conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced  that the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended  from so many aboriginally distinct species.
 Ask, as I have asked, a  celebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have  descended from Long-horns, or both from a common parent-stock, and he  will laugh you to scorn.
 I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck,  or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main breed was  descended from a distinct species.
 Van Mons, in his treatise on pears  and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts,  for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have proceeded  from the seeds of the same tree.
 Innumerable other examples could be  given.
 The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued study  they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several  races; and though they well know that each race varies slightly, for  they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they  ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight  differences accumulated during many successive generations.
 May not  those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than  does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate  links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic  races are descended from the same parents--may they not learn a lesson  of caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature  being lineal descendants of other species?    PRINCIPLES OF SELECTION ANCIENTLY FOLLOWED, AND THEIR EFFECTS.
    Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been  produced, either from one or from several allied species.
 Some effect  may be attributed to the direct and definite action of the external  conditions of life, and some to habit; but he would be a bold man who  would account by such agencies for the differences between a dray and  race-horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon.
  One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we  see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good,  but to man's use or fancy.
 Some variations useful to him have probably  arisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe  that the fuller's teasel, with its hooks, which can not be rivalled by  any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and  this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling.
 So it has  probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been  the case with the ancon sheep.
 But when we compare the dray-horse and  race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted  either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one  breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another  purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man  in different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in  battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with "everlasting  layers" which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and  elegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard,  and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different  seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we  must, I think, look further than to mere variability.
 We can not suppose  that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as  we now see them; indeed, in many cases, we know that this has not been  their history.
 The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature  gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions  useful to him.
 In this sense he may be said to have made for himself  useful breeds.
    The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical.
  It is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a  single lifetime, modified to a large extent their breeds of cattle  and sheep.
 In order fully to realise what they have done it is almost  necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject,  and to inspect the animals.
 Breeders habitually speak of an animal's  organisation as something plastic, which they can model almost as they  please.
 If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this effect  from highly competent authorities.
 Youatt, who was probably better  acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other  individual, and who was himself a very good judge of animals, speaks of  the principle of selection as "that which enables the agriculturist, not  only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether.
  It is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life  whatever form and mould he pleases.
" Lord Somerville, speaking of  what breeders have done for sheep, says: "It would seem as if they had  chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then had given it  existence.
" In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in  regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a  trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture  by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and  the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may  ultimately be selected for breeding.
    What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous  prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have been  exported to almost every quarter of the world.
 The improvement is by no  means generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders  are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes among closely  allied sub-breeds.
 And when a cross has been made, the closest selection  is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases.
 If selection  consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding  from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth  notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by  the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of  differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye--differences  which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate.
 Not one man in  a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an  eminent breeder.
 If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his  subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable  perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he  wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail.
 Few would readily  believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to  become even a skilful pigeon-fancier.
    The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations  are here often more abrupt.
 No one supposes that our choicest  productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal  stock.
 We have proofs that this is not so in several cases in which  exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance,  the steadily increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted.
  We see an astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the  flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only  twenty or thirty years ago.
 When a race of plants is once pretty well  established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but  merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the "rogues," as they call  the plants that deviate from the proper standard.
 With animals this kind  of selection is, in fact, likewise followed; for hardly any one is so  careless as to breed from his worst animals.
    In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated  effects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in  the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the  diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the  kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties;  and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in  comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties.
 See  how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the  flowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the  leaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ  in size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very  slight differences.
 It is not that the varieties which differ largely  in some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly  ever--I speak after careful observation--perhaps never, the case.
 The  law of correlated variation, the importance of which should never be  overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, it  cannot be doubted that the continued selection of slight variations,  either in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races  differing from each other chiefly in these characters.
    It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to  methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century;  it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises  have been published on the subject; and the result has been, in a  corresponding degree, rapid and important.
 But it is very far from  true that the principle is a modern discovery.
 I could give several  references to works of high antiquity, in which the full importance of  the principle is acknowledged.
 In rude and barbarous periods of English  history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to  prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain  size was ordered, and this may be compared to the "roguing" of plants  by nurserymen.
 The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an  ancient Chinese encyclopaedia.
 Explicit rules are laid down by some of  the Roman classical writers.
 From passages in Genesis, it is clear that  the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to.
  Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to  improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages  in Pliny.
 The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by  colour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs.
 Livingstone  states that good domestic breeds are highly valued by the negroes in the  interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans.
 Some of these  facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of  domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now  attended to by the lowest savages.
 It would, indeed, have been a strange  fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of  good and bad qualities is so obvious.
    UNCONSCIOUS SELECTION.
    At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with  a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior  to anything of the kind in the country.
 But, for our purpose, a form of  selection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from every  one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is  more important.
 Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries  to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best  dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the  breed.
 Nevertheless we may infer that this process, continued during  centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as  Bakewell, Collins, etc.
, by this very same process, only carried on more  methodically, did greatly modify, even during their lifetimes, the forms  and qualities of their cattle.
 Slow and insensible changes of this kind  could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings  of the breeds in question have been made long ago, which may serve for  comparison.
 In some cases, however, unchanged, or but little changed,  individuals of the same breed exist in less civilised districts, where  the breed has been less improved.
 There is reason to believe that King  Charles' spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent  since the time of that monarch.
 Some highly competent authorities are  convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and  has probably been slowly altered from it.
 It is known that the English  pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in this  case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses  with the foxhound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been  effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually that,  though the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr. Borrow  has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain like our  pointer.
    By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, English  race-horses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent Arabs,  so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races, are  favoured in the weights which they carry.
 Lord Spencer and others have  shown how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early  maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country.
 By  comparing the accounts given in various old treatises of the former  and present state of carrier and tumbler pigeons in Britain, India,  and Persia, we can trace the stages through which they have insensibly  passed, and come to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.
    Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of  selection which may be considered as unconscious, in so far that the  breeders could never have expected, or even wished, to produce the  result which ensued--namely, the production of the distinct strains.
 The  two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as  Mr. Youatt remarks, "Have been purely bred from the original stock  of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years.
 There is not a suspicion  existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that  the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the  pure blood of Mr. Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the  sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the  appearance of being quite different varieties.
"    If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited  character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal  particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully  preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are  so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more  offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a  kind of unconscious selection going on.
 We see the value set on animals  even by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and  devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than  their dogs.
    In plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional  preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently  distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties,  and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended  together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size  and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose,  pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older  varieties or with their parent-stocks.
 No one would ever expect to get  a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant.
 No one  would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild  pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it  had come from a garden-stock.
 The pear, though cultivated in classical  times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have been a fruit of very  inferior quality.
 I have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural  works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such  splendid results from such poor materials; but the art has been simple,  and, as far as the final result is concerned, has been followed almost  unconsciously.
 It has consisted in always cultivating the best known  variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly better variety chanced  to appear, selecting it, and so onwards.
 But the gardeners of the  classical period, who cultivated the best pears which they could  procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we  owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally  chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.
    A large amount of change, thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated,  explains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that in a number of cases  we cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the wild parent-stocks  of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and  kitchen gardens.
 If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to  improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of  usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia,  the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite  uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture.
 It is  not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance  possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native  plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard  of perfection comparable with that acquired by the plants in countries  anciently civilised.
    In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should  not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their  own food, at least during certain seasons.
 And in two countries very  differently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having  slightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed  better in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of  "natural selection," as will hereafter be more fully explained, two  sub-breeds might be formed.
 This, perhaps, partly explains why the  varieties kept by savages, as has been remarked by some authors,  have more of the character of true species than the varieties kept in  civilised countries.
    On the view here given of the important part which selection by man has  played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races  show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants  or fancies.
 We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal  character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so  great in external characters, and relatively so slight in internal parts  or organs.
 Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any  deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and  indeed he rarely cares for what is internal.
 He can never act by  selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some  slight degree by nature.
 No man would ever try to make a fantail till he  saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual  manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual  size; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first  appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention.
 But to use  such an expression as trying to make a fantail is, I have no doubt, in  most cases, utterly incorrect.
 The man who first selected a pigeon  with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of  that pigeon would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and  partly methodical, selection.
 Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails  had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java  fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as  many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted.
 Perhaps the first  pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now  does the upper part of its oesophagus--a habit which is disregarded by  all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed.
    Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would  be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small  differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however  slight, in one's own possession.
 Nor must the value which would formerly  have been set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same  species, be judged of by the value which is now set on them, after  several breeds have fairly been established.
 It is known that with  pigeons many slight variations now occasionally appear, but these are  rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection in  each breed.
 The common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties;  hence the Toulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour,  that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct  at our poultry-shows.
    These views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed, namely,  that we know hardly anything about the origin or history of any of our  domestic breeds.
 But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language,  can hardly be said to have a distinct origin.
 A man preserves and breeds  from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes  more care than usual in matching his best animals, and thus improves  them, and the improved animals slowly spread in the immediate  neighbourhood.
 But they will as yet hardly have a distinct name,  and from being only slightly valued, their history will have been  disregarded.
 When further improved by the same slow and gradual process,  they will spread more widely, and will be recognised as something  distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial  name.
 In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the  spreading of a new sub-breed will be a slow process.
 As soon as the  points of value are once acknowledged, the principle, as I have called  it, of unconscious selection will always tend--perhaps more at one  period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion--perhaps  more in one district than in another, according to the state of  civilisation of the inhabitants--slowly to add to the characteristic  features of the breed, whatever they may be.
 But the chance will be  infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow,  varying, and insensible changes.
    CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE TO MAN'S POWER OF SELECTION.
    I will now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable or the  reverse, to man's power of selection.
 A high degree of variability is  obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to  work on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient,  with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount  of modification in almost any desired direction.
 But as variations  manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the  chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of  individuals being kept.
 Hence number is of the highest importance for  success.
 On this principle Marshall formerly remarked, with respect  to the sheep of part of Yorkshire, "As they generally belong to poor  people, and are mostly IN SMALL LOTS, they never can be improved.
" On  the other hand, nurserymen, from keeping large stocks of the same plant,  are generally far more successful than amateurs in raising new and  valuable varieties.
 A large number of individuals of an animal or  plant can be reared only where the conditions for its propagation are  favourable.
 When the individuals are scanty all will be allowed to  breed, whatever their quality may be, and this will effectually prevent  selection.
 But probably the most important element is that the animal or  plant should be so highly valued by man, that the closest attention is  paid to even the slightest deviations in its qualities or structure.
  Unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected.
 I have seen it  gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began  to vary just when gardeners began to attend to this plant.
 No doubt the  strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight  varieties had been neglected.
 As soon, however, as gardeners picked out  individual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and  raised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and  bred from them, then (with some aid by crossing distinct species)  those many admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which have  appeared during the last half-century.
    With animals, facility in preventing crosses is an important element  in the formation of new races--at least, in a country which is already  stocked with other races.
 In this respect enclosure of the land plays a  part.
 Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess  more than one breed of the same species.
 Pigeons can be mated for life,  and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may  be improved and kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and this  circumstance must have largely favoured the formation of new breeds.
  Pigeons, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a very  quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed  they serve for food.
 On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal  rambling habits, can not be easily matched, and, although so much valued  by women and children, we rarely see a distinct breed long kept up; such  breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other  country.
 Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less  than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat,  the donkey, peacock, goose, etc.
, may be attributed in main part  to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the  difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by  poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; for recently  in certain parts of Spain and of the United States this animal has been  surprisingly modified and improved by careful selection; in peacocks,  from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese,  from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more  especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct  breeds; but the goose, under the conditions to which it is exposed when  domesticated, seems to have a singularly inflexible organisation, though  it has varied to a slight extent, as I have elsewhere described.
    Some authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our  domestic productions is soon reached, and can never afterward be  exceeded.
 It would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has been  attained in any one case; for almost all our animals and plants have  been greatly improved in many ways within a recent period; and this  implies variation.
 It would be equally rash to assert that characters  now increased to their utmost limit, could not, after remaining fixed  for many centuries, again vary under new conditions of life.
 No doubt,  as Mr. Wallace has remarked with much truth, a limit will be at last  reached.
 For instance, there must be a limit to the fleetness of any  terrestrial animal, as this will be determined by the friction to  be overcome, the weight of the body to be carried, and the power of  contraction in the muscular fibres.
 But what concerns us is that the  domestic varieties of the same species differ from each other in almost  every character, which man has attended to and selected, more than do  the distinct species of the same genera.
 Isidore Geoffroy St.
 Hilaire  has proved this in regard to size, and so it is with colour, and  probably with the length of hair.
 With respect to fleetness, which  depends on many bodily characters, Eclipse was far fleeter, and  a dray-horse is comparably stronger, than any two natural species  belonging to the same genus.
 So with plants, the seeds of the different  varieties of the bean or maize probably differ more in size than do the  seeds of the distinct species in any one genus in the same two families.
  The same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the several  varieties of the plum, and still more strongly with the melon, as well  as in many other analogous cases.
    To sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants.
  Changed conditions of life are of the highest importance in causing  variability, both by acting directly on the organisation, and  indirectly by affecting the reproductive system.
 It is not probable  that variability is an inherent and necessary contingent, under all  circumstances.
 The greater or less force of inheritance and reversion  determine whether variations shall endure.
 Variability is governed  by many unknown laws, of which correlated growth is probably the most  important.
 Something, but how much we do not know, may be attributed to  the definite action of the conditions of life.
 Some, perhaps a great,  effect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of parts.
 The  final result is thus rendered infinitely complex.
 In some cases the  intercrossing of aboriginally distinct species appears to have played  an important part in the origin of our breeds.
 When several breeds have  once been formed in any country, their occasional intercrossing, with  the aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation  of new sub-breeds; but the importance of crossing has been much  exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are  propagated by seed.
 With plants which are temporarily propagated by  cuttings, buds, etc.
, the importance of crossing is immense; for the  cultivator may here disregard the extreme variability both of hybrids  and of mongrels, and the sterility of hybrids; but plants not propagated  by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only  temporary.
 Over all these causes of change, the accumulative action of  selection, whether applied methodically and quickly, or unconsciously  and slowly, but more efficiently, seems to have been the predominant  power.
          .
 VARIATION UNDER NATURE.
     Variability--Individual differences--Doubtful species--Wide ranging,   much diffused, and common species, vary most--Species of the larger   genera in each country vary more frequently than the species of the   smaller genera--Many of the species of the larger genera resemble   varieties in being very closely, but unequally, related to each other,   and in having restricted ranges.
      Before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic  beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these  latter are subject to any variation.
 To treat this subject properly, a  long catalogue of dry facts ought to be given; but these I shall reserve  for a future work.
 Nor shall I here discuss the various definitions  which have been given of the term species.
 No one definition has  satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what  he means when he speaks of a species.
 Generally the term includes the  unknown element of a distinct act of creation.
 The term "variety" is  almost equally difficult to define; but here community of descent is  almost universally implied, though it can rarely be proved.
 We have also  what are called monstrosities; but they graduate into varieties.
 By a  monstrosity I presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure,  generally injurious, or not useful to the species.
 Some authors use  the term "variation" in a technical sense, as implying a modification  directly due to the physical conditions of life; and "variations" in  this sense are supposed not to be inherited; but who can say that the  dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the Baltic, or  dwarfed plants on Alpine summits, or the thicker fur of an animal from  far northwards, would not in some cases be inherited for at least a few  generations? And in this case I presume that the form would be called a  variety.
    It may be doubted whether sudden and considerable deviations of  structure, such as we occasionally see in our domestic productions, more  especially with plants, are ever permanently propagated in a state  of nature.
 Almost every part of every organic being is so beautifully  related to its complex conditions of life that it seems as improbable  that any part should have been suddenly produced perfect, as that a  complex machine should have been invented by man in a perfect state.
  Under domestication monstrosities sometimes occur which resemble normal  structures in widely different animals.
 Thus pigs have occasionally been  born with a sort of proboscis, and if any wild species of the same genus  had naturally possessed a proboscis, it might have been argued that this  had appeared as a monstrosity; but I have as yet failed to find, after  diligent search, cases of monstrosities resembling normal structures in  nearly allied forms, and these alone bear on the question.
 If monstrous  forms of this kind ever do appear in a state of nature and are capable  of reproduction (which is not always the case), as they occur rarely  and singly, their preservation would depend on unusually favourable  circumstances.
 They would, also, during the first and succeeding  generations cross with the ordinary form, and thus their abnormal  character would almost inevitably be lost.
 But I shall have to return  in a future chapter to the preservation and perpetuation of single or  occasional variations.
    INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES.
    The many slight differences which appear in the offspring from the  same parents, or which it may be presumed have thus arisen, from being  observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same  confined locality, may be called individual differences.
 No one supposes  that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the same actual  mould.
 These individual differences are of the highest importance for  us, for they are often inherited, as must be familiar to every one;  and they thus afford materials for natural selection to act on and  accumulate, in the same manner as man accumulates in any given direction  individual differences in his domesticated productions.
 These individual  differences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant  parts; but I could show, by a long catalogue of facts, that parts  which must be called important, whether viewed under a physiological or  classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the individuals of the  same species.
 I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist  would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in  important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority,  as I have collected, during a course of years.
 It should be remembered  that systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability  in important characters, and that there are not many men who will  laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in  many specimens of the same species.
 It would never have been expected  that the branching of the main nerves close to the great central  ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species;  it might have been thought that changes of this nature could have been  effected only by slow degrees; yet Sir J.
 Lubbock has shown a degree of  variability in these main nerves in Coccus, which may almost be compared  to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree.
 This philosophical  naturalist, I may add, has also shown that the muscles in the larvae  of certain insects are far from uniform.
 Authors sometimes argue in a  circle when they state that important organs never vary; for these  same authors practically rank those parts as important (as some few  naturalists have honestly confessed) which do not vary; and, under  this point of view, no instance will ever be found of an important part  varying; but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can  be given.
    There is one point connected with individual differences which is  extremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have been called  "protean" or "polymorphic," in which species present an inordinate  amount of variation.
 With respect to many of these forms, hardly two  naturalists agree whether to rank them as species or as varieties.
 We  may instance Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium among plants, several genera of  insects, and of Brachiopod shells.
 In most polymorphic genera some  of the species have fixed and definite characters.
 Genera which  are polymorphic in one country seem to be, with a few exceptions,  polymorphic in other countries, and likewise, judging from Brachiopod  shells, at former periods of time.
 These facts are very perplexing, for  they seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the  conditions of life.
 I am inclined to suspect that we see, at least in  some of these polymorphic genera, variations which are of no service or  disservice to the species, and which consequently have not been seized  on and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter to be  explained.
    Individuals of the same species often present, as is known to every one,  great differences of structure, independently of variation, as in the  two sexes of various animals, in the two or three castes of sterile  females or workers among insects, and in the immature and larval states  of many of the lower animals.
 There are, also, cases of dimorphism and  trimorphism, both with animals and plants.
 Thus, Mr. Wallace, who has  lately called attention to the subject, has shown that the females of  certain species of butterflies, in the Malayan Archipelago, regularly  appear under two or even three conspicuously distinct forms, not  connected by intermediate varieties.
 Fritz Muller has described  analogous but more extraordinary cases with the males of certain  Brazilian Crustaceans: thus, the male of a Tanais regularly occurs  under two distinct forms; one of these has strong and differently shaped  pincers, and the other has antennae much more abundantly furnished with  smelling-hairs.
 Although in most of these cases, the two or three forms,  both with animals and plants, are not now connected by intermediate  gradations, it is possible that they were once thus connected.
 Mr.  Wallace, for instance, describes a certain butterfly which presents in  the same island a great range of varieties connected by intermediate  links, and the extreme links of the chain closely resemble the two forms  of an allied dimorphic species inhabiting another part of the Malay  Archipelago.
 Thus also with ants, the several worker-castes are  generally quite distinct; but in some cases, as we shall hereafter see,  the castes are connected together by finely graduated varieties.
 So it  is, as I have myself observed, with some dimorphic plants.
 It certainly  at first appears a highly remarkable fact that the same female butterfly  should have the power of producing at the same time three distinct  female forms and a male; and that an hermaphrodite plant should produce  from the same seed-capsule three distinct hermaphrodite forms, bearing  three different kinds of females and three or even six different kinds  of males.
 Nevertheless these cases are only exaggerations of the common  fact that the female produces offspring of two sexes which sometimes  differ from each other in a wonderful manner.
    DOUBTFUL SPECIES.
    The forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of  species, but which are so closely similar to other forms, or are so  closely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do  not like to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the  most important for us.
 We have every reason to believe that many of  these doubtful and closely allied forms have permanently retained their  characters for a long time; for as long, as far as we know, as have good  and true species.
 Practically, when a naturalist can unite by means of  intermediate links any two forms, he treats the one as a variety of the  other, ranking the most common, but sometimes the one first described  as the species, and the other as the variety.
 But cases of great  difficulty, which I will not here enumerate, sometimes arise in deciding  whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another, even when  they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor will the commonly  assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate forms always remove the  difficulty.
 In very many cases, however, one form is ranked as a variety  of another, not because the intermediate links have actually been found,  but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do  now somewhere exist, or may formerly have existed; and here a wide door  for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened.
    Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or  a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide  experience seems the only guide to follow.
 We must, however, in many  cases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and  well-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species  by at least some competent judges.
    That varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be  disputed.
 Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of France, or  of the United States, drawn up by different botanists, and see what  a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good  species, and by another as mere varieties.
 Mr. H.
C.
 Watson, to whom I  lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for  me 182 British plants, which are generally considered as varieties, but  which have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making this  list he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have  been ranked by some botanists as species, and he has entirely omitted  several highly polymorphic genera.
 Under genera, including the most  polymorphic forms, Mr. Babington gives 251 species, whereas Mr. Bentham  gives only 112--a difference of 139 doubtful forms! Among animals which  unite for each birth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful forms,  ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety, can  rarely be found within the same country, but are common in separated  areas.
 How many of the birds and insects in North America and Europe,  which differ very slightly from each other, have been ranked by one  eminent naturalist as undoubted species, and by another as varieties,  or, as they are often called, geographical races! Mr. Wallace, in  several valuable papers on the various animals, especially on the  Lepidoptera, inhabiting the islands of the great Malayan Archipelago,  shows that they may be classed under four heads, namely, as variable  forms, as local forms, as geographical races or sub-species, and as true  representative species.
 The first or variable forms vary much within the  limits of the same island.
 The local forms are moderately constant and  distinct in each separate island; but when all from the several islands  are compared together, the differences are seen to be so slight and  graduated that it is impossible to define or describe them, though  at the same time the extreme forms are sufficiently distinct.
 The  geographical races or sub-species are local forms completely fixed and  isolated; but as they do not differ from each other by strongly marked  and important characters, "There is no possible test but individual  opinion to determine which of them shall be considered as species and  which as varieties.
" Lastly, representative species fill the same  place in the natural economy of each island as do the local forms and  sub-species; but as they are distinguished from each other by a greater  amount of difference than that between the local forms and sub-species,  they are almost universally ranked by naturalists as true species.
  Nevertheless, no certain criterion can possibly be given by which  variable forms, local forms, sub species and representative species can  be recognised.
    Many years ago, when comparing, and seeing others compare, the birds  from the closely neighbouring islands of the Galapagos Archipelago,  one with another, and with those from the American mainland, I was  much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between  species and varieties.
 On the islets of the little Madeira group there  are many insects which are characterized as varieties in Mr. Wollaston's  admirable work, but which would certainly be ranked as distinct species  by many entomologists.
 Even Ireland has a few animals, now generally  regarded as varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some  zoologists.
 Several experienced ornithologists consider our British red  grouse as only a strongly marked race of a Norwegian species, whereas  the greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to Great  Britain.
 A wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads  many naturalists to rank them as distinct species; but what distance, it  has been well asked, will suffice if that between America and Europe  is ample, will that between Europe and the Azores, or Madeira, or the  Canaries, or between the several islets of these small archipelagos, be  sufficient?    Mr. B.
D.
 Walsh, a distinguished entomologist of the United States, has  described what he calls Phytophagic varieties and Phytophagic species.
  Most vegetable-feeding insects live on one kind of plant or on one  group of plants; some feed indiscriminately on many kinds, but do not  in consequence vary.
 In several cases, however, insects found living on  different plants, have been observed by Mr. Walsh to present in their  larval or mature state, or in both states, slight, though constant  differences in colour, size, or in the nature of their secretions.
  In some instances the males alone, in other instances, both males and  females, have been observed thus to differ in a slight degree.
 When the  differences are rather more strongly marked, and when both sexes and  all ages are affected, the forms are ranked by all entomologists as good  species.
 But no observer can determine for another, even if he can do so  for himself, which of these Phytophagic forms ought to be called species  and which varieties.
 Mr. Walsh ranks the forms which it may be supposed  would freely intercross, as varieties; and those which appear to have  lost this power, as species.
 As the differences depend on the insects  having long fed on distinct plants, it cannot be expected that  intermediate links connecting the several forms should now be found.
  The naturalist thus loses his best guide in determining whether to rank  doubtful forms as varieties or species.
 This likewise necessarily occurs  with closely allied organisms, which inhabit distinct continents or  islands.
 When, on the other hand, an animal or plant ranges over the  same continent, or inhabits many islands in the same archipelago, and  presents different forms in the different areas, there is always a  good chance that intermediate forms will be discovered which will link  together the extreme states; and these are then degraded to the rank of  varieties.
    Some few naturalists maintain that animals never present varieties; but  then these same naturalists rank the slightest difference as of specific  value; and when the same identical form is met with in two distant  countries, or in two geological formations, they believe that two  distinct species are hidden under the same dress.
 The term species thus  comes to be a mere useless abstraction, implying and assuming a separate  act of creation.
 It is certain that many forms, considered by highly  competent judges to be varieties, resemble species so completely in  character that they have been thus ranked by other highly competent  judges.
 But to discuss whether they ought to be called species or  varieties, before any definition of these terms has been generally  accepted, is vainly to beat the air.
    Many of the cases of strongly marked varieties or doubtful species well  deserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from  geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, etc.
, have  been brought to bear in the attempt to determine their rank; but space  does not here permit me to discuss them.
 Close investigation, in many  cases, will no doubt bring naturalists to agree how to rank doubtful  forms.
 Yet it must be confessed that it is in the best known countries  that we find the greatest number of them.
 I have been struck with the  fact that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful  to man, or from any cause closely attracts his attention, varieties of  it will almost universally be found recorded.
 These varieties, moreover,  will often be ranked by some authors as species.
 Look at the common oak,  how closely it has been studied; yet a German author makes more than a  dozen species out of forms, which are almost universally considered  by other botanists to be varieties; and in this country the highest  botanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the  sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or  mere varieties.
    I may here allude to a remarkable memoir lately published by A.
 de  Candolle, on the oaks of the whole world.
 No one ever had more ample  materials for the discrimination of the species, or could have worked on  them with more zeal and sagacity.
 He first gives in detail all the many  points of structure which vary in the several species, and estimates  numerically the relative frequency of the variations.
 He specifies above  a dozen characters which may be found varying even on the same branch,  sometimes according to age or development, sometimes without any  assignable reason.
 Such characters are not of course of specific value,  but they are, as Asa Gray has remarked in commenting on this memoir,  such as generally enter into specific definitions.
 De Candolle then goes  on to say that he gives the rank of species to the forms that differ by  characters never varying on the same tree, and never found connected  by intermediate states.
 After this discussion, the result of so much  labour, he emphatically remarks: "They are mistaken, who repeat that the  greater part of our species are clearly limited, and that the doubtful  species are in a feeble minority.
 This seemed to be true, so long as  a genus was imperfectly known, and its species were founded upon a few  specimens, that is to say, were provisional.
 Just as we come to know  them better, intermediate forms flow in, and doubts as to specific  limits augment.
" He also adds that it is the best known species which  present the greatest number of spontaneous varieties and sub-varieties.
  Thus Quercus robur has twenty-eight varieties, all of which, excepting  six, are clustered round three sub-species, namely Q.
 pedunculata,  sessiliflora and pubescens.
 The forms which connect these three  sub-species are comparatively rare; and, as Asa Gray again remarks, if  these connecting forms which are now rare were to become totally extinct  the three sub-species would hold exactly the same relation to each other  as do the four or five provisionally admitted species which closely  surround the typical Quercus robur.
 Finally, De Candolle admits that  out of the 300 species, which will be enumerated in his Prodromus  as belonging to the oak family, at least two-thirds are provisional  species, that is, are not known strictly to fulfil the definition above  given of a true species.
 It should be added that De Candolle no longer  believes that species are immutable creations, but concludes that the  derivative theory is the most natural one, "and the most accordant with  the known facts in palaeontology, geographical botany and zoology, of  anatomical structure and classification.
"    When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms  quite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed in determining what  differences to consider as specific and what as varietal; for he knows  nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is  subject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some  variation.
 But if he confine his attention to one class within one  country he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful  forms.
 His general tendency will be to make many species, for he will  become impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry fancier before alluded  to, with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually  studying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation  in other groups and in other countries by which to correct his first  impressions.
 As he extends the range of his observations he will meet  with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater number of  closely-allied forms.
 But if his observations be widely extended he  will in the end generally be able to make up his own mind; but he will  succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variation, and the  truth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists.
  When he comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now  continuous, in which case he cannot hope to find intermediate links,  he will be compelled to trust almost entirely to analogy, and his  difficulties will rise to a climax.
    Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between  species and sub-species--that is, the forms which in the opinion of some  naturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at, the rank of  species; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or  between lesser varieties and individual differences.
 These differences  blend into each other by an insensible series; and a series impresses  the mind with the idea of an actual passage.
    Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to the  systematist, as of the highest importance for us, as being the first  step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording  in works on natural history.
 And I look at varieties which are in any  degree more distinct and permanent, as steps toward more strongly marked  and permanent varieties; and at the latter, as leading to sub-species,  and then to species.
 The passage from one stage of difference to another  may, in many cases, be the simple result of the nature of the organism  and of the different physical conditions to which it has long been  exposed; but with respect to the more important and adaptive characters,  the passage from one stage of difference to another may be safely  attributed to the cumulative action of natural selection, hereafter  to be explained, and to the effects of the increased use or disuse  of parts.
 A well-marked variety may therefore be called an incipient  species; but whether this belief is justifiable must be judged by the  weight of the various facts and considerations to be given throughout  this work.
    It need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species attain  the rank of species.
 They may become extinct, or they may endure as  varieties for very long periods, as has been shown to be the case by Mr.  Wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil land-shells in Madeira,  and with plants by Gaston de Saporta.
 If a variety were to flourish so  as to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then rank as the  species, and the species as the variety; or it might come to supplant  and exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist, and both  rank as independent species.
 But we shall hereafter return to this  subject.
    From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species  as one arbitrarily given, for the sake of convenience, to a set  of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not  essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less  distinct and more fluctuating forms.
 The term variety, again,  in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied  arbitrarily, for convenience sake.
    WIDE-RANGING, MUCH DIFFUSED, AND COMMON SPECIES VARY MOST.
    Guided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some interesting  results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the  species which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several  well-worked floras.
 At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H.
C.
  Watson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance  on this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as  did subsequently Dr.
 Hooker, even in stronger terms.
 I shall reserve for  a future work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables of  the proportional numbers of the varying species.
 Dr.
 Hooker permits me  to add that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined  the tables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well  established.
 The whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here  is with much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be  avoided to the "struggle for existence," "divergence of character," and  other questions, hereafter to be discussed.
    Alphonse de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have  very wide ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been  expected, as they are exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as  they come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far  more important circumstance) with different sets of organic beings.
 But  my tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which  are the most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species  which are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a  different consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from  commonness), oftenest give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to  have been recorded in botanical works.
 Hence it is the most flourishing,  or, as they may be called, the dominant species--those which range  widely, are the most diffused in their own country, and are the most  numerous in individuals--which oftenest produce well-marked varieties,  or, as I consider them, incipient species.
 And this, perhaps, might have  been anticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree  permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of  the country, the species which are already dominant will be the most  likely to yield offspring, which, though in some slight degree modified,  still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become  dominant over their compatriots.
 In these remarks on predominence, it  should be understood that reference is made only to the forms which come  into competition with each other, and more especially to the members  of the same genus or class having nearly similar habits of life.
 With  respect to the number of individuals or commonness of species, the  comparison of course relates only to the members of the same group.
 One  of the higher plants may be said to be dominant if it be more numerous  in individuals and more widely diffused than the other plants of the  same country, which live under nearly the same conditions.
 A plant of  this kind is not the less dominant because some conferva inhabiting  the water or some parasitic fungus is infinitely more numerous in  individuals, and more widely diffused.
 But if the conferva or parasitic  fungus exceeds its allies in the above respects, it will then be  dominant within its own class.
    SPECIES OF THE LARGER GENERA IN EACH COUNTRY VARY MORE FREQUENTLY THAN  THE SPECIES OF THE SMALLER GENERA.
    If the plants inhabiting a country as described in any Flora, be divided  into two equal masses, all those in the larger genera (i.
e.
, those  including many species) being placed on one side, and all those in the  smaller genera on the other side, the former will be found to include a  somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant  species.
 This might have been anticipated, for the mere fact of many  species of the same genus inhabiting any country, shows that there  is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country  favourable to the genus; and, consequently, we might have expected to  have found in the larger genera, or those including many species, a  larger proportional number of dominant species.
 But so many causes tend  to obscure this result, that I am surprised that my tables show even a  small majority on the side of the larger genera.
 I will here allude  to only two causes of obscurity.
 Fresh water and salt-loving plants  generally have very wide ranges and are much diffused, but this seems to  be connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them, and has  little or no relation to the size of the genera to which the species  belong.
 Again, plants low in the scale of organisation are generally  much more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale; and here  again there is no close relation to the size of the genera.
 The cause of  lowly-organised plants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter  on Geographical Distribution.
    From looking at species as only strongly marked and well-defined  varieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera  in each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the  smaller genera; for wherever many closely related species (i.
e.
, species  of the same genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species  ought, as a general rule, to be now forming.
 Where many large trees  grow, we expect to find saplings.
 Where many species of a genus have  been formed through variation, circumstances have been favourable  for variation; and hence we might expect that the circumstances would  generally still be favourable to variation.
 On the other hand, if we  look at each species as a special act of creation, there is no apparent  reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species,  than in one having few.
    To test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of  twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into  two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side,  and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably  proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the  side of the larger genera presented varieties, than on the side of the  smaller genera.
 Moreover, the species of the large genera which present  any varieties, invariably present a larger average number of varieties  than do the species of the small genera.
 Both these results follow when  another division is made, and when all the least genera, with from only  one to four species, are altogether excluded from the tables.
 These  facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only  strongly marked and permanent varieties; for wherever many species of  the same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression,  the manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find  the manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason  to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one.
  And this certainly holds true if varieties be looked at as incipient  species; for my tables clearly show, as a general rule, that, wherever  many species of a genus have been formed, the species of that genus  present a number of varieties, that is, of incipient species, beyond the  average.
 It is not that all large genera are now varying much, and are  thus increasing in the number of their species, or that no small genera  are now varying and increasing; for if this had been so, it would have  been fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small  genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size;  and that large genera have often come to their maxima, declined, and  disappeared.
 All that we want to show is, that where many species of a  genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming; and this  certainly holds good.
    MANY OF THE SPECIES INCLUDED WITHIN THE LARGER GENERA RESEMBLE VARIETIES  IN BEING VERY CLOSELY, BUT UNEQUALLY, RELATED TO EACH OTHER, AND IN  HAVING RESTRICTED RANGES.
    There are other relations between the species of large genera and their  recorded varieties which deserve notice.
 We have seen that there is no  infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked  varieties; and when intermediate links have not been found between  doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by  the amount of difference between them, judging by analogy whether or not  the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species.
 Hence  the amount of difference is one very important criterion in settling  whether two forms should be ranked as species or varieties.
 Now Fries  has remarked in regard to plants, and Westwood in regard to insects,  that in large genera the amount of difference between the species is  often exceedingly small.
 I have endeavoured to test this numerically by  averages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they confirm the view.
  I have also consulted some sagacious and experienced observers,  and, after deliberation, they concur in this view.
 In this respect,  therefore, the species of the larger genera resemble varieties, more  than do the species of the smaller genera.
 Or the case may be put in  another way, and it may be said, that in the larger genera, in which a  number of varieties or incipient species greater than the average are  now manufacturing, many of the species already manufactured still to a  certain extent resemble varieties, for they differ from each other by a  less than the usual amount of difference.
    Moreover, the species of the larger genera are related to each other, in  the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to  each other.
 No naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are  equally distinct from each other; they may generally be divided into  sub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups.
 As Fries has well remarked,  little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around  other species.
 And what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally  related to each other, and clustered round certain forms--that is, round  their parent-species.
 Undoubtedly there is one most important point of  difference between varieties and species, namely, that the amount of  difference between varieties, when compared with each other or with  their parent-species, is much less than that between the species of the  same genus.
 But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of  divergence of character, we shall see how this may be explained, and  how the lesser differences between varieties tend to increase into the  greater differences between species.
    There is one other point which is worth notice.
 Varieties generally have  much restricted ranges.
 This statement is indeed scarcely more than a  truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of  its supposed parent-species, their denominations would be reversed.
  But there is reason to believe that the species which are very closely  allied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties, often have  much restricted ranges.
 For instance, Mr. H.
C.
 Watson has marked for me  in the well-sifted London catalogue of Plants (4th edition) sixty-three  plants which are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as  so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these  sixty-three reputed species range on an average over 6.
9 of the  provinces into which Mr. Watson has divided Great Britain.
 Now, in this  same catalogue, fifty-three acknowledged varieties are recorded, and  these range over 7.
7 provinces; whereas, the species to which these  varieties belong range over 14.
3 provinces.
 So that the acknowledged  varieties have very nearly the same restricted average range, as have  the closely allied forms, marked for me by Mr. Watson as doubtful  species, but which are almost universally ranked by British botanists as  good and true species.
    SUMMARY.
    Finally, varieties cannot be distinguished from species--except, first,  by the discovery of intermediate linking forms; and, secondly, by a  certain indefinite amount of difference between them; for two forms,  if differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties,  notwithstanding that they cannot be closely connected; but the amount  of difference considered necessary to give to any two forms the rank of  species cannot be defined.
 In genera having more than the average number  of species in any country, the species of these genera have more than  the average number of varieties.
 In large genera the species are apt to  be closely but unequally allied together, forming little clusters round  other species.
 Species very closely allied to other species apparently  have restricted ranges.
 In all these respects the species of large  genera present a strong analogy with varieties.
 And we can clearly  understand these analogies, if species once existed as varieties, and  thus originated; whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if  species are independent creations.
    We have also seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant species  of the larger genera within each class which on an average yield the  greatest number of varieties, and varieties, as we shall hereafter see,  tend to become converted into new and distinct species.
 Thus the larger  genera tend to become larger; and throughout nature the forms of life  which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving  many modified and dominant descendants.
 But, by steps hereafter to be  explained, the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera.
  And thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into  groups subordinate to groups.

 STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.
     Its bearing on natural selection--The term used in a wide   sense--Geometrical ratio of increase--Rapid increase of naturalised   animals and plants--Nature of the checks to increase--Competition   universal--Effects of climate--Protection from the number of   individuals--Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout   nature--Struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties   of the same species: often severe between species of the same genus--The   relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations.
    Before entering on the subject of this  must make a few  preliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on  natural selection.
 It has been seen in the last chapter that  among organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual  variability: indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed.
  It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called  species or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or  three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold,  if the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted.
 But the  mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked  varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but  little in understanding how species arise in nature.
 How have all those  exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part,  and to the conditions of life and of one organic being to another being,  been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in  the woodpecker and the mistletoe; and only a little less plainly in the  humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers  of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water;  in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we  see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic  world.
    Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called  incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct  species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far  more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups  of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera and which  differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus,  arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next  chapter, follow from the struggle for life.
 Owing to this struggle,  variations, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if they  be in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species, in their  infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their  physical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of such  individuals, and will generally be inherited by the offspring.
 The  offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of  the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a  small number can survive.
 I have called this principle, by which  each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural  selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.
  But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of  the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.
 We  have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and  can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of  slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature.
 But  Natural Selection, we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready  for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as  the works of Nature are to those of Art.
    We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence.
  In my future work this subject will be treated, as it well deserves,  at greater length.
 The elder De Candolle and Lyell have largely and  philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe  competition.
 In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with  more spirit and ability than W.
 Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently  the result of his great horticultural knowledge.
 Nothing is easier than  to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or  more difficult--at least I found it so--than constantly to bear this  conclusion in mind.
 Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind,  the whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity,  abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite  misunderstood.
 We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we  often see superabundance of food; we do not see or we forget that the  birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds,  and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these  songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and  beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that, though food may be  now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year.
    THE TERM, STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE, USED IN A LARGE SENSE.
    I should premise that I use this term in a large and metaphorical sense,  including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is  more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in  leaving progeny.
 Two canine animals, in a time of dearth, may be truly  said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live.
 But a  plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the  drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the  moisture.
 A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which  only one of an average comes to maturity, may be more truly said to  struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already  clothe the ground.
 The mistletoe is dependent on the apple and a few  other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle  with these trees, for, if too many of these parasites grow on the same  tree, it languishes and dies.
 But several seedling mistletoes, growing  close together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle  with each other.
 As the mistletoe is disseminated by birds, its  existence depends on them; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle  with other fruit-bearing plants, in tempting the birds to devour and  thus disseminate its seeds.
 In these several senses, which pass into  each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of Struggle for  Existence.
    GEOMETRICAL RATIO OF INCREASE.
    A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which  all organic beings tend to increase.
 Every being, which during its  natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction  during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional  year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers  would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support  the product.
 Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly  survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either  one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals  of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life.
 It is the  doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and  vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase  of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage.
 Although some  species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all  cannot do so, for the world would not hold them.
    There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally  increases at so high a rate, that, if not destroyed, the earth would  soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair.
 Even slow-breeding  man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than  a thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his  progeny.
 Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only  two seeds--and there is no plant so unproductive as this--and their  seedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there  would be a million plants.
 The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder  of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its  probable minimum rate of natural increase; it will be safest to assume  that it begins breeding when thirty years old, and goes on breeding  till ninety years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and  surviving till one hundred years old; if this be so, after a period of  from 740 to 750 years there would be nearly nineteen million elephants  alive descended from the first pair.
    But we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical  calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly  rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when  circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following  seasons.
 Still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals  of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world; if the  statements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses  in South America, and latterly in Australia, had not been well  authenticated, they would have been incredible.
 So it is with plants;  cases could be given of introduced plants which have become common  throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years.
 Several of  the plants, such as the cardoon and a tall thistle, which are now the  commonest over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues  of surface almost to the exclusion of every other plant, have been  introduced from Europe; and there are plants which now range in India,  as I hear from Dr.
 Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, which  have been imported from America since its discovery.
 In such cases, and  endless others could be given, no one supposes that the fertility of  the animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any  sensible degree.
 The obvious explanation is that the conditions of life  have been highly favourable, and that there has consequently been less  destruction of the old and young and that nearly all the young have been  enabled to breed.
 Their geometrical ratio of increase, the result  of which never fails to be surprising, simply explains their  extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion in their new homes.
    In a state of nature almost every full-grown plant annually produces  seed, and among animals there are very few which do not annually pair.
  Hence we may confidently assert that all plants and animals are tending  to increase at a geometrical ratio--that all would rapidly stock every  station in which they could any how exist, and that this geometrical  tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of  life.
 Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think,  to mislead us; we see no great destruction falling on them, and we do  not keep in mind that thousands are annually slaughtered for food,  and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be  disposed of.
    The only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or  seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is,  that the slow breeders would require a few more years to people, under  favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large.
 The  condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the  same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two.
 The Fulmar  petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird  in the world.
 One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the  hippobosca, a single one.
 But this difference does not determine how  many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district.
 A  large number of eggs is of some importance to those species which depend  on a fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to increase  in number.
 But the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is  to make up for much destruction at some period of life; and this period  in the great majority of cases is an early one.
 If an animal can in any  way protect its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and  yet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are  destroyed, many must be produced or the species will become extinct.
 It  would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on an  average for a thousand years, if a single seed were produced once in a  thousand years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed and could  be ensured to germinate in a fitting place; so that, in all cases, the  average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the  number of its eggs or seeds.
    In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing  considerations always in mind--never to forget that every single organic  being may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers;  that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy  destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during each  generation or at recurrent intervals.
 Lighten any check, mitigate the  destruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost  instantaneously increase to any amount.
    NATURE OF THE CHECKS TO INCREASE.
    The causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase  are most obscure.
 Look at the most vigorous species; by as much as it  swarms in numbers, by so much will it tend to increase still further.
 We  know not exactly what the checks are even in a single instance.
 Nor will  this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head,  even in regard to mankind, although so incomparably better known than  any other animal.
 This subject of the checks to increase has been ably  treated by several authors, and I hope in a future work to discuss it at  considerable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of  South America.
 Here I will make only a few remarks, just to recall to  the reader's mind some of the chief points.
 Eggs or very young animals  seem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case.
 With  plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but from some observations  which I have made it appears that the seedlings suffer most from  germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants.
  Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for  instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and  cleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, I marked  all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and out of 357  no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects.
 If turf  which has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf  closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants  gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown plants; thus out of  twenty species grown on a little plot of mown turf (three feet by four)  nine species perished, from the other species being allowed to grow up  freely.
    The amount of food for each species, of course, gives the extreme limit  to which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining  food, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the  average number of a species.
 Thus, there seems to be little doubt that  the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends  chiefly on the destruction of vermin.
 If not one head of game were shot  during the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no  vermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game  than at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now  annually shot.
 On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant,  none are destroyed by beasts of prey; for even the tiger in India most  rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.
    Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of  a species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought seem to be  the most effective of all checks.
 I estimated (chiefly from the greatly  reduced numbers of nests in the spring) that the winter of 1854-5  destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is  a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent.
 is an  extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man.
 The action of  climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for  existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it  brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of  the same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food.
  Even when climate, for instance, extreme cold, acts directly, it will  be the least vigorous individuals, or those which have got least food  through the advancing winter, which will suffer the most.
 When we travel  from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably  see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally  disappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are  tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action.
 But this is  a false view; we forget that each species, even where it most abounds,  is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life,  from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food; and if  these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any  slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers; and as each  area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species must  decrease.
 When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in  numbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other  species being favoured, as in this one being hurt.
 So it is when we  travel northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of  species of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northward;  hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener  meet with stunted forms, due to the DIRECTLY injurious action of  climate, than we do in proceeding southward or in descending a mountain.
  When we reach the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute  deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements.
    That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species we  clearly see in the prodigious number of plants which in our gardens can  perfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised,  for they cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by  our native animals.
    When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases  inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics--at least, this  seems generally to occur with our game animals--often ensue; and here  we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life.
 But even  some of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms,  which have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of  diffusion among the crowded animals, been disproportionally favoured:  and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.
    On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the  same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely  necessary for its preservation.
 Thus we can easily raise plenty of  corn and rape-seed, etc.
, in our fields, because the seeds are in great  excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can  the birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season,  increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their  numbers are checked during the winter; but any one who has tried knows  how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants  in a garden; I have in this case lost every single seed.
 This view of  the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation,  explains, I believe, some singular facts in nature such as that of very  rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant, in the few spots where  they do exist; and that of some social plants being social, that is  abounding in individuals, even on the extreme verge of their range.
 For  in such cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where  the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist  together, and thus save the species from utter destruction.
 I should  add that the good effects of intercrossing, and the ill effects of close  interbreeding, no doubt come into play in many of these cases; but I  will not here enlarge on this subject.
    COMPLEX RELATIONS OF ALL ANIMALS AND PLANTS TO EACH OTHER IN THE  STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.
    Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the  checks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle  together in the same country.
 I will give only a single instance, which,  though a simple one, interested me.
 In Staffordshire, on the estate of  a relation, where I had ample means of investigation, there was a large  and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the hand  of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been  enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir.
 The  change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was  most remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from one quite  different soil to another: not only the proportional numbers of the  heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants (not  counting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which could  not be found on the heath.
 The effect on the insects must have been  still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the  plantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was  frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds.
 Here we see how  potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing  whatever else having been done, with the exception of the land having  been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter.
 But how important an  element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey.
 Here  there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on  the distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been  enclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so  close together that all cannot live.
 When I ascertained that these young  trees had not been sown or planted I was so much surprised at their  numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine  hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not  see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps.
 But on looking  closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings  and little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle.
  In one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of  the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, with  twenty-six rings of growth, had, during many years tried to raise its  head above the stems of the heath, and had failed.
 No wonder that, as  soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously  growing young firs.
 Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so  extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so  closely and effectually searched it for food.
    Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch  fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence  of cattle.
 Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this;  for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though  they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and  Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay  of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals  when first born.
 The increase of these flies, numerous as they are,  must be habitually checked by some means, probably by other parasitic  insects.
 Hence, if certain insectivorous birds were to decrease in  Paraguay, the parasitic insects would probably increase; and this would  lessen the number of the navel-frequenting flies--then cattle and horses  would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed  I have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this again  would largely affect the insects; and this, as we have just seen  in Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in  ever-increasing circles of complexity.
 Not that under nature the  relations will ever be as simple as this.
 Battle within battle must be  continually recurring with varying success; and yet in the long-run the  forces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature remains for long  periods of time uniform, though assuredly the merest trifle would give  the victory to one organic being over another.
 Nevertheless, so profound  is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel when we  hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the  cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the  duration of the forms of life!    I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals,  remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex  relations.
 I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic  Lobelia fulgens is never visited in my garden by insects, and  consequently, from its peculiar structure, never sets a seed.
 Nearly  all our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of insects  to remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them.
 I find  from experiments that humble-bees are almost indispensable to the  fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do  not visit this flower.
 I have also found that the visits of bees are  necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover; for instance  twenty heads of Dutch clover (Trifolium repens) yielded 2,290 seeds, but  twenty other heads, protected from bees, produced not one.
 Again, 100  heads of red clover (T.
 pratense) produced 2,700 seeds, but the same  number of protected heads produced not a single seed.
 Humble bees alone  visit red clover, as other bees cannot reach the nectar.
 It has been  suggested that moths may fertilise the clovers; but I doubt whether they  could do so in the case of the red clover, from their weight not being  sufficient to depress the wing petals.
 Hence we may infer as highly  probable that, if the whole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very  rare in England, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare,  or wholly disappear.
 The number of humble-bees in any district depends  in a great measure upon the number of field-mice, which destroy their  combs and nests; and Colonel Newman, who has long attended to the habits  of humble-bees, believes that "more than two-thirds of them are  thus destroyed all over England.
" Now the number of mice is largely  dependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and Colonel  Newman says, "Near villages and small towns I have found the nests  of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the  number of cats that destroy the mice.
" Hence it is quite credible that  the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might  determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the  frequency of certain flowers in that district!    In the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different  periods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come  into play; some one check or some few being generally the most potent,  but all will concur in determining the average number, or even  the existence of the species.
 In some cases it can be shown that  widely-different checks act on the same species in different districts.
  When we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we  are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we  call chance.
 But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that when  an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs  up; but it has been observed that ancient Indian ruins in the Southern  United States, which must formerly have been cleared of trees, now  display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the  surrounding virgin forests.
 What a struggle must have gone on during  long centuries between the several kinds of trees, each annually  scattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and  insect--between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts  of prey--all striving to increase, all feeding on each other, or on the  trees, their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first  clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees.
 Throw up  a handful of feathers, and all fall to the ground according to definite  laws; but how simple is the problem where each shall fall compared to  that of the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals  which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional  numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins!    The dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its  prey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature.
 This  is likewise sometimes the case with those which may strictly be said to  struggle with each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and  grass-feeding quadrupeds.
 But the struggle will almost invariably  be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they  frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed  to the same dangers.
 In the case of varieties of the same species, the  struggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see  the contest soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be  sown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which  best suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will  beat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few  years supplant the other varieties.
 To keep up a mixed stock of even  such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas,  they must be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed  in due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in  number and disappear.
 So again with the varieties of sheep: it has  been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other  mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together.
 The same  result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the  medicinal leech.
 It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any  of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength,  habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed  stock (crossing being prevented) could be kept up for half-a-dozen  generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, in the same  manner as beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young were not  annually preserved in due proportion.
    STRUGGLE FOR LIFE MOST SEVERE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND VARIETIES OF THE  SAME SPECIES.
    As the species of the same genus usually have, though by no means  invariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and always in  structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between them, if  they come into competition with each other, than between the species of  distinct genera.
 We see this in the recent extension over parts of the  United States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of  another species.
 The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of  Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush.
 How frequently we  hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under  the most different climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach  has everywhere driven before it its great congener.
 In Australia the  imported hive-bee is rapidly exterminating the small, stingless native  bee.
 One species of charlock has been known to supplant another species;  and so in other cases.
 We can dimly see why the competition should be  most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in  the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely  say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle  of life.
    A corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing  remarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related,  in the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other  organic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or  residence, or from which it has to escape, or on which it preys.
 This  is obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and in  that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on  the tiger's body.
 But in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion,  and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation  seems at first confined to the elements of air and water.
 Yet the  advantage of the plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation  to the land being already thickly clothed with other plants; so that the  seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground.
 In the  water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for diving,  allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own  prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals.
    The store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at  first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants.
 But from the  strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds, as peas and  beans, when sown in the midst of long grass, it may be suspected that  the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of  the seedlings, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously  all around.
    Look at a plant in the midst of its range! Why does it not double or  quadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand a  little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges  into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts.
 In this case  we can clearly see that if we wish in imagination to give the plant the  power of increasing in numbers, we should have to give it some advantage  over its competitors, or over the animals which prey on it.
 On the  confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with  respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we  have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far,  that they are destroyed exclusively by the rigour of the climate.
 Not  until we reach the extreme confines of life, in the Arctic regions or on  the borders of an utter desert, will competition cease.
 The land may be  extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between some few  species, or between the individuals of the same species, for the warmest  or dampest spots.
    Hence we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country,  among new competitors, the conditions of its life will generally be  changed in an essential manner, although the climate may be exactly the  same as in its former home.
 If its average numbers are to increase in  its new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to what we  should have had to do in its native country; for we should have to give  it some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies.
    It is good thus to try in imagination to give any one species an  advantage over another.
 Probably in no single instance should we know  what to do.
 This ought to convince us of our ignorance on the mutual  relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it is  difficult to acquire.
 All that we can do is to keep steadily in mind  that each organic being is striving to increase in a geometrical ratio;  that each, at some period of its life, during some season of the year,  during each generation, or at intervals, has to struggle for life and  to suffer great destruction.
 When we reflect on this struggle we may  console ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not  incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and  that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.
          .
 NATURAL SELECTION; OR THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
     Natural Selection--its power compared with man's selection--its power   on characters of trifling importance--its power at all ages and on   both sexes--Sexual Selection--On the generality of intercrosses   between individuals of the same species--Circumstances favourable and   unfavourable to the results of Natural Selection, namely, intercrossing,   isolation, number of individuals--Slow action--Extinction caused by   Natural Selection--Divergence of Character, related to the diversity of   inhabitants of any small area and to naturalisation--Action of Natural   Selection, through Divergence of Character and Extinction, on the   descendants from a common parent--Explains the Grouping of all organic   beings--Advance in organisation--Low forms preserved--Convergence of   character--Indefinite multiplication of species--Summary.
      How will the struggle for existence, briefly discussed in the last  chapter, act in regard to variation? Can the principle of selection,  which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply under nature?  I think we shall see that it can act most efficiently.
 Let the endless  number of slight variations and individual differences occurring in our  domestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, in those under nature, be  borne in mind; as well as the strength of the hereditary tendency.
 Under  domestication, it may truly be said that the whole organisation becomes  in some degree plastic.
 But the variability, which we almost universally  meet with in our domestic productions is not directly produced, as  Hooker and Asa Gray have well remarked, by man; he can neither originate  varieties nor prevent their occurrence; he can only preserve and  accumulate such as do occur.
 Unintentionally he exposes organic beings  to new and changing conditions of life, and variability ensues; but  similar changes of conditions might and do occur under nature.
 Let it  also be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are  the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their  physical conditions of life; and consequently what infinitely varied  diversities of structure might be of use to each being under changing  conditions of life.
 Can it then be thought improbable, seeing that  variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other  variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex  battle of life, should occur in the course of many successive  generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more  individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having  any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance  of surviving and procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel  sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly  destroyed.
 This preservation of favourable individual differences and  variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have  called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest.
 Variations  neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection,  and would be left either a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in  certain polymorphic species, or would ultimately become fixed, owing to  the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions.
    Several writers have misapprehended or objected to the term Natural  Selection.
 Some have even imagined that natural selection induces  variability, whereas it implies only the preservation of such variations  as arise and are beneficial to the being under its conditions of life.
  No one objects to agriculturists speaking of the potent effects of man's  selection; and in this case the individual differences given by nature,  which man for some object selects, must of necessity first occur.
 Others  have objected that the term selection implies conscious choice in the  animals which become modified; and it has even been urged that, as  plants have no volition, natural selection is not applicable to them!  In the literal sense of the word, no doubt, natural selection is a  false term; but who ever objected to chemists speaking of the elective  affinities of the various elements?--and yet an acid cannot strictly be  said to elect the base with which it in preference combines.
 It has been  said that I speak of natural selection as an active power or Deity; but  who objects to an author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling  the movements of the planets? Every one knows what is meant and is  implied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary  for brevity.
 So again it is difficult to avoid personifying the word  Nature; but I mean by nature, only the aggregate action and product of  many natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained  by us.
 With a little familiarity such superficial objections will be  forgotten.
    We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by  taking the case of a country undergoing some slight physical change, for  instance, of climate.
 The proportional numbers of its inhabitants will  almost immediately undergo a change, and some species will probably  become extinct.
 We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate  and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are  bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of the  inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would  seriously affect the others.
 If the country were open on its borders,  new forms would certainly immigrate, and this would likewise seriously  disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants.
 Let it be  remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or  mammal has been shown to be.
 But in the case of an island, or of a  country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted  forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy  of nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of the  original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area  been open to immigration, these same places would have been seized on  by intruders.
 In such cases, slight modifications, which in any way  favoured the individuals of any species, by better adapting them to  their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural  selection would have free scope for the work of improvement.
    We have good reason to believe, as shown in the first chapter,  that changes in the conditions of life give a tendency to increased  variability; and in the foregoing cases the conditions the changed, and  this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by affording  a better chance of the occurrence of profitable variations.
 Unless such  occur, natural selection can do nothing.
 Under the term of "variations,"  it must never be forgotten that mere individual differences are  included.
 As man can produce a great result with his domestic animals  and plants by adding up in any given direction individual differences,  so could natural selection, but far more easily from having incomparably  longer time for action.
 Nor do I believe that any great physical change,  as of climate, or any unusual degree of isolation, to check immigration,  is necessary in order that new and unoccupied places should be left  for natural selection to fill up by improving some of the varying  inhabitants.
 For as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling  together with nicely balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in  the structure or habits of one species would often give it an advantage  over others; and still further modifications of the same kind would  often still further increase the advantage, as long as the species  continued under the same conditions of life and profited by similar  means of subsistence and defence.
 No country can be named in which all  the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to  the physical conditions under which they live, that none of them could  be still better adapted or improved; for in all countries, the natives  have been so far conquered by naturalised productions that they have  allowed some foreigners to take firm possession of the land.
 And as  foreigners have thus in every country beaten some of the natives, we  may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with  advantage, so as to have better resisted the intruders.
    As man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result by his  methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not natural  selection effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters:  Nature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural preservation or  survival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so far  as they are useful to any being.
 She can act on every internal organ,  on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of  life.
 Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the  being which she tends.
 Every selected character is fully exercised by  her, as is implied by the fact of their selection.
 Man keeps the natives  of many climates in the same country.
 He seldom exercises each selected  character in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a  short-beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed  or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep  with long and short wool to the same climate; does not allow the most  vigorous males to struggle for the females; he does not rigidly destroy  all inferior animals, but protects during each varying season, as far as  lies in his power, all his productions.
 He often begins his selection  by some half-monstrous form, or at least by some modification prominent  enough to catch the eye or to be plainly useful to him.
 Under nature,  the slightest differences of structure or constitution may well turn the  nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so be preserved.
  How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! How short his time,  and consequently how poor will be his results, compared with those  accumulated by Nature during whole geological periods! Can we wonder,  then, that Nature's productions should be far "truer" in character than  man's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the  most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of  far higher workmanship?    It may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly  scrutinising, throughout the world, the slightest variations; rejecting  those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are good; silently  and insensibly working, WHENEVER AND WHEREVER OPPORTUNITY OFFERS, at  the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and  inorganic conditions of life.
 We see nothing of these slow changes in  progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and  then so imperfect is our view into long-past geological ages that we see  only that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly  were.
    In order that any great amount of modification should be effected in a  species, a variety, when once formed must again, perhaps after a long  interval of time, vary or present individual differences of the same  favourable nature as before; and these must again be preserved, and so  onward, step by step.
 Seeing that individual differences of the  same kind perpetually recur, this can hardly be considered as an  unwarrantable assumption.
 But whether it is true, we can judge only  by seeing how far the hypothesis accords with and explains the general  phenomena of nature.
 On the other hand, the ordinary belief that the  amount of possible variation is a strictly limited quantity, is likewise  a simple assumption.
    Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each  being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of  very trifling importance, may thus be acted on.
 When we see leaf-eating  insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white  in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, we must believe that  these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them  from danger.
 Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives,  would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely  from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey,--so  much so that on parts of the continent persons are warned not to keep  white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction.
 Hence natural  selection might be effective in giving the proper colour to each kind  of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and  constant.
 Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an  animal of any particular colour would produce little effect; we should  remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy a lamb  with the faintest trace of black.
 We have seen how the colour of hogs,  which feed on the "paint-root" in Virginia, determines whether they  shall live or die.
 In plants, the down on the fruit and the colour of  the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling  importance; yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing,  that in the United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a  beetle, a Curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far  more from a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease  attacks yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured  flesh.
 If, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a  great difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a  state of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees  and with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle  which variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or a purple-fleshed  fruit, should succeed.
    In looking at many small points of difference between species, which,  as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem quite unimportant, we  must not forget that climate, food, etc.
, have no doubt produced some  direct effect.
 It is also necessary to bear in mind that, owing to  the law of correlation, when one part varies and the variations are  accumulated through natural selection, other modifications, often of the  most unexpected nature, will ensue.
    As we see that those variations which, under domestication, appear at  any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the  same period; for instance, in the shape, size and flavour of the seeds  of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the  caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the  eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in the  horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult; so in a state of nature  natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at  any age, by the accumulation of variations profitable at that age, and  by their inheritance at a corresponding age.
 If it profit a plant to  have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see  no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection,  than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the  down in the pods on his cotton-trees.
 Natural selection may modify  and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly  different from those which concern the mature insect; and these  modifications may affect, through correlation, the structure of the  adult.
 So, conversely, modifications in the adult may affect the  structure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure  that they shall not be injurious: for if they were so, the species would  become extinct.
    Natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to  the parent and of the parent in relation to the young.
 In social animals  it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the  whole community; if the community profits by the selected change.
 What  natural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of one species,  without giving it any advantage, for the good of another species;  and though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural  history, I cannot find one case which will bear investigation.
 A  structure used only once in an animal's life, if of high importance to  it, might be modified to any extent by natural selection; for instance,  the great jaws possessed by certain insects, used exclusively for  opening the cocoon--or the hard tip to the beak of unhatched birds,  used for breaking the eggs.
 It has been asserted, that of the best  short-beaked tumbler-pigeons a greater number perish in the egg than are  able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching.
  Now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short  for the bird's own advantage, the process of modification would be very  slow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection  of all the young birds within the egg, which had the most powerful and  hardest beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or, more  delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness  of the shell being known to vary like every other structure.
    It may be well here to remark that with all beings there must be much  fortuitous destruction, which can have little or no influence on the  course of natural selection.
 For instance, a vast number of eggs or  seeds are annually devoured, and these could be modified through natural  selection only if they varied in some manner which protected them from  their enemies.
 Yet many of these eggs or seeds would perhaps, if not  destroyed, have yielded individuals better adapted to their conditions  of life than any of those which happened to survive.
 So again a vast  number of mature animals and plants, whether or not they be the best  adapted to their conditions, must be annually destroyed by accidental  causes, which would not be in the least degree mitigated by certain  changes of structure or constitution which would in other ways be  beneficial to the species.
 But let the destruction of the adults be ever  so heavy, if the number which can exist in any district be not wholly  kept down by such causes--or again let the destruction of eggs or  seeds be so great that only a hundredth or a thousandth part are  developed--yet of those which do survive, the best adapted individuals,  supposing that there is any variability in a favourable direction,  will tend to propagate their kind in larger numbers than the less  well adapted.
 If the numbers be wholly kept down by the causes just  indicated, as will often have been the case, natural selection will  be powerless in certain beneficial directions; but this is no valid  objection to its efficiency at other times and in other ways; for we  are far from having any reason to suppose that many species ever undergo  modification and improvement at the same time in the same area.
    SEXUAL SELECTION.
    Inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex  and become hereditarily attached to that sex, so no doubt it will be  under nature.
 Thus it is rendered possible for the two sexes to be  modified through natural selection in relation to different habits  of life, as is sometimes the case; or for one sex to be modified in  relation to the other sex, as commonly occurs.
 This leads me to say a  few words on what I have called sexual selection.
 This form of selection  depends, not on a struggle for existence in relation to other organic  beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the  individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the  other sex.
 The result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but  few or no offspring.
 Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than  natural selection.
 Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are  best fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny.
 But in  many cases victory depends not so much on general vigour, but on having  special weapons, confined to the male sex.
 A hornless stag or spurless  cock would have a poor chance of leaving numerous offspring.
 Sexual  selection, by always allowing the victor to breed, might surely give  indomitable courage, length of spur, and strength to the wing to  strike in the spurred leg, in nearly the same manner as does the brutal  cockfighter by the careful selection of his best cocks.
 How low in the  scale of nature the law of battle descends I know not; male alligators  have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like  Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons  have been observed fighting all day long; male stag-beetles sometimes  bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males; the males of certain  hymenopterous insects have been frequently seen by that inimitable  observer M.
 Fabre, fighting for a particular female who sits by, an  apparently unconcerned beholder of the struggle, and then retires  with the conqueror.
 The war is, perhaps, severest between the males  of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special  weapons.
 The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed; though  to them and to others, special means of defence may be given through  means of sexual selection, as the mane of the lion, and the hooked jaw  to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory as  the sword or spear.
    Among birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character.
 All  those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the  severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract, by  singing, the females.
 The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of paradise,  and some others, congregate, and successive males display with the most  elaborate care, and show off in the best manner, their gorgeous plumage;  they likewise perform strange antics before the females, which, standing  by as spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner.
 Those who  have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they  often take individual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R.
 Heron has  described how a pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen  birds.
 I cannot here enter on the necessary details; but if man can in a  short time give beauty and an elegant carriage to his bantams, according  to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female  birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious  or beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce  a marked effect.
 Some well-known laws, with respect to the plumage of  male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can  partly be explained through the action of sexual selection on variations  occurring at different ages, and transmitted to the males alone or to  both sexes at corresponding ages; but I have not space here to enter on  this subject.
    Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal  have the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour,  or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual  selection: that is, by individual males having had, in successive  generations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons,  means of defence, or charms; which they have transmitted to their  male offspring alone.
 Yet, I would not wish to attribute all sexual  differences to this agency: for we see in our domestic animals  peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex, which  apparently have not been augmented through selection by man.
 The tuft of  hair on the breast of the wild turkey-cock cannot be of any use, and it  is doubtful whether it can be ornamental in the eyes of the female bird;  indeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication it would have been  called a monstrosity.
    ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE ACTION OF NATURAL SELECTION, OR THE SURVIVAL OF THE  FITTEST.
    In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I  must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations.
 Let us  take the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some  by craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose  that the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in  the country increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased  in numbers, during that season of the year when the wolf was hardest  pressed for food.
 Under such circumstances the swiftest and slimmest  wolves have the best chance of surviving, and so be preserved or  selected, provided always that they retained strength to master their  prey at this or some other period of the year, when they were compelled  to prey on other animals.
 I can see no more reason to doubt that  this would be the result, than that man should be able to improve the  fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by  that kind of unconscious selection which follows from each man trying to  keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed.
 I may  add that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf  inhabiting the Catskill Mountains, in the United States, one with a  light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more bulky,  with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the shepherd's flocks.
    Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on  which our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to  pursue certain kinds of prey.
 Nor can this be thought very improbable;  for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our  domestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another  mice; one cat, according to Mr. St.
 John, bringing home winged game,  another hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and  almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes.
 The tendency to catch rats  rather than mice is known to be inherited.
 Now, if any slight innate  change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would  have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring.
 Some of its  young would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the  repetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would  either supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf.
 Or, again,  the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the  lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the  continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites,  two varieties might slowly be formed.
 These varieties would cross and  blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon  have to return.
 I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two  varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the United  States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and  the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks  the shepherd's flocks.
    It should be observed that in the above illustration, I speak of the  slimmest individual wolves, and not of any single strongly marked  variation having been preserved.
 In former editions of this work I  sometimes spoke as if this latter alternative had frequently occurred.
  I saw the great importance of individual differences, and this led me  fully to discuss the results of unconscious selection by man,  which depends on the preservation of all the more or less valuable  individuals, and on the destruction of the worst.
 I saw, also, that  the preservation in a state of nature of any occasional deviation of  structure, such as a monstrosity, would be a rare event; and that, if at  first preserved, it would generally be lost by subsequent intercrossing  with ordinary individuals.
 Nevertheless, until reading an able and  valuable article in the "North British Review" (1867), I did not  appreciate how rarely single variations, whether slight or strongly  marked, could be perpetuated.
 The author takes the case of a pair of  animals, producing during their lifetime two hundred offspring, of  which, from various causes of destruction, only two on an average  survive to pro-create their kind.
 This is rather an extreme estimate  for most of the higher animals, but by no means so for many of the lower  organisms.
 He then shows that if a single individual were born, which  varied in some manner, giving it twice as good a chance of life as that  of the other individuals, yet the chances would be strongly against its  survival.
 Supposing it to survive and to breed, and that half its young  inherited the favourable variation; still, as the Reviewer goes onto  show, the young would have only a slightly better chance of surviving  and breeding; and this chance would go on decreasing in the succeeding  generations.
 The justice of these remarks cannot, I think, be disputed.
  If, for instance, a bird of some kind could procure its food more easily  by having its beak curved, and if one were born with its beak strongly  curved, and which consequently flourished, nevertheless there would be  a very poor chance of this one individual perpetuating its kind to the  exclusion of the common form; but there can hardly be a doubt, judging  by what we see taking place under domestication, that this result would  follow from the preservation during many generations of a large number  of individuals with more or less strongly curved beaks, and from the  destruction of a still larger number with the straightest beaks.
    It should not, however, be overlooked that certain rather strongly  marked variations, which no one would rank as mere individual  differences, frequently recur owing to a similar organisation being  similarly acted on--of which fact numerous instances could be given with  our domestic productions.
 In such cases, if the varying individual did  not actually transmit to its offspring its newly-acquired character, it  would undoubtedly transmit to them, as long as the existing conditions  remained the same, a still stronger tendency to vary in the same manner.
  There can also be little doubt that the tendency to vary in the same  manner has often been so strong that all the individuals of the same  species have been similarly modified without the aid of any form of  selection.
 Or only a third, fifth, or tenth part of the individuals may  have been thus affected, of which fact several instances could be given.
  Thus Graba estimates that about one-fifth of the guillemots in the Faroe  Islands consist of a variety so well marked, that it was formerly ranked  as a distinct species under the name of Uria lacrymans.
 In cases of this  kind, if the variation were of a beneficial nature, the original form  would soon be supplanted by the modified form, through the survival of  the fittest.
    To the effects of intercrossing in eliminating variations of all kinds,  I shall have to recur; but it may be here remarked that most animals and  plants keep to their proper homes, and do not needlessly wander about;  we see this even with migratory birds, which almost always return to the  same spot.
 Consequently each newly-formed variety would generally be at  first local, as seems to be the common rule with varieties in a state  of nature; so that similarly modified individuals would soon exist in a  small body together, and would often breed together.
 If the new variety  were successful in its battle for life, it would slowly spread from  a central district, competing with and conquering the unchanged  individuals on the margins of an ever-increasing circle.
    It may be worth while to give another and more complex illustration of  the action of natural selection.
 Certain plants excrete sweet juice,  apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from the sap:  this is effected, for instance, by glands at the base of the stipules in  some Leguminosae, and at the backs of the leaves of the common laurel.
  This juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects; but  their visits do not in any way benefit the plant.
 Now, let us suppose  that the juice or nectar was excreted from the inside of the flowers of  a certain number of plants of any species.
 Insects in seeking the nectar  would get dusted with pollen, and would often transport it from one  flower to another.
 The flowers of two distinct individuals of the same  species would thus get crossed; and the act of crossing, as can be fully  proved, gives rise to vigorous seedlings, which consequently would have  the best chance of flourishing and surviving.
 The plants which produced  flowers with the largest glands or nectaries, excreting most nectar,  would oftenest be visited by insects, and would oftenest be crossed; and  so in the long-run would gain the upper hand and form a local variety.
  The flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in  relation to the size and habits of the particular insect which visited  them, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of the pollen, would  likewise be favoured.
 We might have taken the case of insects visiting  flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as  pollen is formed for the sole purpose of fertilisation, its destruction  appears to be a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen  were carried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the  pollen-devouring insects from flower to flower, and a cross thus  effected, although nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed it  might still be a great gain to the plant to be thus robbed; and the  individuals which produced more and more pollen, and had larger anthers,  would be selected.
    When our plant, by the above process long continued, had been rendered  highly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part,  regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they do this  effectually I could easily show by many striking facts.
 I will give only  one, as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of  plants.
 Some holly-trees bear only male flowers, which have four stamens  producing a rather small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil;  other holly-trees bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized  pistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain  of pollen can be detected.
 Having found a female tree exactly sixty  yards from a male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from  different branches, under the microscope, and on all, without exception,  there were a few pollen-grains, and on some a profusion.
 As the wind had  set for several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen could  not thus have been carried.
 The weather had been cold and boisterous and  therefore not favourable to bees, nevertheless every female flower which  I examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees, which had flown  from tree to tree in search of nectar.
 But to return to our imaginary  case; as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to  insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another  process might commence.
 No naturalist doubts the advantage of what has  been called the "physiological division of labour;" hence we may believe  that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one  flower or on one whole plant, and pistils alone in another flower or on  another plant.
 In plants under culture and placed under new conditions  of life, sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs  become more or less impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever  so slight a degree under nature, then, as pollen is already carried  regularly from flower to flower, and as a more complete separation of  the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of  the division of labour, individuals with this tendency more and more  increased, would be continually favoured or selected, until at last a  complete separation of the sexes might be effected.
 It would take up  too much space to show the various steps, through dimorphism and other  means, by which the separation of the sexes in plants of various kinds  is apparently now in progress; but I may add that some of the species  of holly in North America are, according to Asa Gray, in an exactly  intermediate condition, or, as he expresses it, are more or less  dioeciously polygamous.
    Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects; we may suppose the  plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued  selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects depended in  main part on its nectar for food.
 I could give many facts showing how  anxious bees are to save time: for instance, their habit of cutting  holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which with  a very little more trouble they can enter by the mouth.
 Bearing such  facts in mind, it may be believed that under certain circumstances  individual differences in the curvature or length of the proboscis,  etc.
, too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other  insect, so that certain individuals would be able to obtain their  food more quickly than others; and thus the communities to which they  belonged would flourish and throw off many swarms inheriting the same  peculiarities.
 The tubes of the corolla of the common red or incarnate  clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance  appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar  out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red clover, which  is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red clover  offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee.
  That this nectar is much liked by the hive-bee is certain; for I have  repeatedly seen, but only in the autumn, many hive-bees sucking the  flowers through holes bitten in the base of the tube by humble bees.
  The difference in the length of the corolla in the two kinds of clover,  which determines the visits of the hive-bee, must be very trifling; for  I have been assured that when red clover has been mown, the flowers of  the second crop are somewhat smaller, and that these are visited by many  hive-bees.
 I do not know whether this statement is accurate; nor whether  another published statement can be trusted, namely, that the Ligurian  bee, which is generally considered a mere variety of the common  hive-bee, and which freely crosses with it, is able to reach and suck  the nectar of the red clover.
 Thus, in a country where this kind of  clover abounded, it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a  slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis.
 On the other hand,  as the fertility of this clover absolutely depends on bees visiting the  flowers, if humble-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be  a great advantage to the plant to have a shorter or more deeply divided  corolla, so that the hive-bees should be enabled to suck its flowers.
  Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either  simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted to each  other in the most perfect manner, by the continued preservation of all  the individuals which presented slight deviations of structure mutually  favourable to each other.
    I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in  the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which  were first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble views on "the modern  changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology;" but we now seldom  hear the agencies which we see still at work, spoken of as trifling and  insignificant, when used in explaining the excavation of the deepest  valleys or the formation of long lines of inland cliffs.
 Natural  selection acts only by the preservation and accumulation of small  inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and  as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a  great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection banish  the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any  great and sudden modification in their structure.
    ON THE INTERCROSSING OF INDIVIDUALS.
    I must here introduce a short digression.
 In the case of animals  and plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two  individuals must always (with the exception of the curious and not well  understood cases of parthenogenesis) unite for each birth; but in the  case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious.
 Nevertheless there is  reason to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals, either  occasionally or habitually, concur for the reproduction of their kind.
  This view was long ago doubtfully suggested by Sprengel, Knight and  Kolreuter.
 We shall presently see its importance; but I must here treat  the subject with extreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared  for an ample discussion.
 All vertebrate animals, all insects and some  other large groups of animals, pair for each birth.
 Modern research  has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of real  hermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly  unite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us.
 But still there  are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair,  and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites.
 What reason, it may be  asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever  concur in reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on details, I  must trust to some general considerations alone.
    In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, and made  so many experiments, showing, in accordance with the almost universal  belief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross between  different varieties, or between individuals of the same variety but of  another strain, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and on the  other hand, that CLOSE interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility;  that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law  of nature that no organic being fertilises itself for a perpetuity  of generations; but that a cross with another individual is  occasionally--perhaps at long intervals of time--indispensable.
    On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, understand  several large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any  other view are inexplicable.
 Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable  exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a  multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the  weather! If an occasional cross be indispensable, notwithstanding that  the plant's own anthers and pistil stand so near each other as almost  to ensure self-fertilisation, the fullest freedom for the entrance of  pollen from another individual will explain the above state of exposure  of the organs.
 Many flowers, on the other hand, have their organs of  fructification closely enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or  pea-family; but these almost invariably present beautiful and curious  adaptations in relation to the visits of insects.
 So necessary are the  visits of bees to many papilionaceous flowers, that their fertility is  greatly diminished if these visits be prevented.
 Now, it is scarcely  possible for insects to fly from flower to flower, and not to carry  pollen from one to the other, to the great good of the plant.
  Insects act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is sufficient, to ensure  fertilisation, just to touch with the same brush the anthers of one  flower and then the stigma of another; but it must not be supposed that  bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species;  for if a plant's own pollen and that from another species are placed  on the same stigma, the former is so prepotent that it invariably and  completely destroys, as has been shown by Gartner, the influence of the  foreign pollen.
    When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or  slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems  adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful  for this end: but the agency of insects is often required to cause the  stamens to spring forward, as Kolreuter has shown to be the case with  the barberry; and in this very genus, which seems to have a special  contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that, if  closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it is  hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they naturally  cross.
 In numerous other cases, far from self-fertilisation being  favoured, there are special contrivances which effectually prevent the  stigma receiving pollen from its own flower, as I could show from the  works of Sprengel and others, as well as from my own observations: for  instance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and elaborate  contrivance by which all the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are  swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower, before the stigma of  that individual flower is ready to receive them; and as this flower is  never visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a seed,  though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another, I  raise plenty of seedlings.
 Another species of Lobelia, which is visited  by bees, seeds freely in my garden.
 In very many other cases, though  there is no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma  receiving pollen from the same flower, yet, as Sprengel, and more  recently Hildebrand and others have shown, and as I can confirm, either  the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the  stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that  these so-named dichogamous plants have in fact separated sexes, and  must habitually be crossed.
 So it is with the reciprocally dimorphic and  trimorphic plants previously alluded to.
 How strange are these facts!  How strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower,  though placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of  self-fertilisation, should be in so many cases mutually useless to each  other! How simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional  cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable!    If several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other  plants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority of the  seedlings thus raised turn out, as I found, mongrels: for instance, I  raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties  growing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to their kind,  and some even of these were not perfectly true.
 Yet the pistil of each  cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but by  those of the many other flowers on the same plant; and the pollen of  each flower readily gets on its stigma without insect agency; for I  have found that plants carefully protected from insects produce the  full number of pods.
 How, then, comes it that such a vast number of the  seedlings are mongrelized? It must arise from the pollen of a distinct  VARIETY having a prepotent effect over the flower's own pollen; and  that this is part of the general law of good being derived from the  intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species.
 When distinct  SPECIES are crossed the case is reversed, for a plant's own pollen  is always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall  return in a future chapter.
    In the case of a large tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may be  objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and at  most only from flower to flower on the same tree; and flowers on the  same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited  sense.
 I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has largely  provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers  with separated sexes.
 When the sexes are separated, although the male  and female flowers may be produced on the same tree, pollen must be  regularly carried from flower to flower; and this will give a better  chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree.
 That  trees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often separated than  other plants, I find to be the case in this country; and at my request  Dr.
 Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr.
 Asa Gray those  of the United States, and the result was as I anticipated.
 On the  other hand, Dr.
 Hooker informs me that the rule does not hold good in  Australia: but if most of the Australian trees are dichogamous, the same  result would follow as if they bore flowers with separated sexes.
 I have  made these few remarks on trees simply to call attention to the subject.
    Turning for a brief space to animals: various terrestrial species are  hermaphrodites, such as the land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these  all pair.
 As yet I have not found a single terrestrial animal which  can fertilise itself.
 This remarkable fact, which offers so strong a  contrast with terrestrial plants, is intelligible on the view of an  occasional cross being indispensable; for owing to the nature of the  fertilising element there are no means, analogous to the action of  insects and of the wind with plants, by which an occasional cross could  be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two  individuals.
 Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising  hermaphrodites; but here the currents of water offer an obvious means  for an occasional cross.
 As in the case of flowers, I have as yet  failed, after consultation with one of the highest authorities, namely,  Professor Huxley, to discover a single hermaphrodite animal with the  organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed that access from without,  and the occasional influence of a distinct individual, can be shown to  be physically impossible.
 Cirripedes long appeared to me to present,  under this point of view, a case of great difficulty; but I have been  enabled, by a fortunate chance, to prove that two individuals, though  both are self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.
    It must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, both  with animals and plants, some species of the same family and even of  the same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in their whole  organisation, are hermaphrodites, and some unisexual.
 But if, in fact,  all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross, the difference between  them and unisexual species is, as far as function is concerned, very  small.
    From these several considerations and from the many special facts which  I have collected, but which I am unable here to give, it appears that  with animals and plants an occasional intercross between distinct  individuals is a very general, if not universal, law of nature.
    CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NEW FORMS THROUGH NATURAL  SELECTION.
    This is an extremely intricate subject.
 A great amount of variability,  under which term individual differences are always included, will  evidently be favourable.
 A large number of individuals, by giving a  better chance within any given period for the appearance of profitable  variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each  individual, and is, I believe, a highly important element of success.
  Though nature grants long periods of time for the work of natural  selection, she does not grant an indefinite period; for as all organic  beings are striving to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if  any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding  degree with its competitors it will be exterminated.
 Unless favourable  variations be inherited by some at least of the offspring, nothing can  be effected by natural selection.
 The tendency to reversion may often  check or prevent the work; but as this tendency has not prevented man  from forming by selection numerous domestic races, why should it prevail  against natural selection?    In the case of methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite  object, and if the individuals be allowed freely to intercross, his work  will completely fail.
 But when many men, without intending to alter  the breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to  procure and breed from the best animals, improvement surely but slowly  follows from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding that  there is no separation of selected individuals.
 Thus it will be under  nature; for within a confined area, with some place in the natural  polity not perfectly occupied, all the individuals varying in the right  direction, though in different degrees, will tend to be preserved.
  But if the area be large, its several districts will almost certainly  present different conditions of life; and then, if the same species  undergoes modification in different districts, the newly formed  varieties will intercross on the confines of each.
 But we shall see in  the sixth chapter that intermediate varieties, inhabiting intermediate  districts, will in the long run generally be supplanted by one of the  adjoining varieties.
 Intercrossing will chiefly affect those animals  which unite for each birth and wander much, and which do not breed at a  very quick rate.
 Hence with animals of this nature, for instance birds,  varieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this  I find to be the case.
 With hermaphrodite organisms which cross only  occasionally, and likewise with animals which unite for each birth, but  which wander little and can increase at a rapid rate, a new and improved  variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there  maintain itself in a body and afterward spread, so that the individuals  of the new variety would chiefly cross together.
 On this principle  nurserymen always prefer saving seed from a large body of plants, as the  chance of intercrossing is thus lessened.
    Even with animals which unite for each birth, and which do not propagate  rapidly, we must not assume that free intercrossing would always  eliminate the effects of natural selection; for I can bring forward  a considerable body of facts showing that within the same area two  varieties of the same animal may long remain distinct, from haunting  different stations, from breeding at slightly different seasons, or from  the individuals of each variety preferring to pair together.
    Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature by keeping the  individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and  uniform in character.
 It will obviously thus act far more efficiently  with those animals which unite for each birth; but, as already stated,  we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with  all animals and plants.
 Even if these take place only at long intervals  of time, the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and  fertility over the offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation,  that they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their  kind; and thus in the long run the influence of crosses, even at rare  intervals, will be great.
 With respect to organic beings extremely low  in the scale, which do not propagate sexually, nor conjugate, and which  cannot possibly intercross, uniformity of character can be retained by  them under the same conditions of life, only through the principle  of inheritance, and through natural selection which will destroy any  individuals departing from the proper type.
 If the conditions of life  change and the form undergoes modification, uniformity of character  can be given to the modified offspring, solely by natural selection  preserving similar favourable variations.
    Isolation also is an important element in the modification of species  through natural selection.
 In a confined or isolated area, if not very  large, the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be  almost uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all  the varying individuals of the same species in the same manner.
  Intercrossing with the inhabitants of the surrounding districts,  will also be thus prevented.
 Moritz Wagner has lately published an  interesting essay on this subject, and has shown that the service  rendered by isolation in preventing crosses between newly-formed  varieties is probably greater even than I supposed.
 But from reasons  already assigned I can by no means agree with this naturalist, that  migration and isolation are necessary elements for the formation of new  species.
 The importance of isolation is likewise great in preventing,  after any physical change in the conditions, such as of climate,  elevation of the land, etc.
, the immigration of better adapted  organisms; and thus new places in the natural economy of the district  will be left open to be filled up by the modification of the old  inhabitants.
 Lastly, isolation will give time for a new variety to be  improved at a slow rate; and this may sometimes be of much importance.
  If, however, an isolated area be very small, either from being  surrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar physical  conditions, the total number of the inhabitants will be small; and this  will retard the production of new species through natural selection, by  decreasing the chances of favourable variations arising.
    The mere lapse of time by itself does nothing, either for or against  natural selection.
 I state this because it has been erroneously asserted  that the element of time has been assumed by me to play an all-important  part in modifying species, as if all the forms of life were necessarily  undergoing change through some innate law.
 Lapse of time is only so far  important, and its importance in this respect is great, that it gives  a better chance of beneficial variations arising and of their being  selected, accumulated, and fixed.
 It likewise tends to increase the  direct action of the physical conditions of life, in relation to the  constitution of each organism.
    If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at any  small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the number of  the species inhabiting it is small, as we shall see in our chapter on  Geographical Distribution; yet of these species a very large proportion  are endemic,--that is, have been produced there and nowhere else in the  world.
 Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly  favourable for the production of new species.
 But we may thus deceive  ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large  open area like a continent, has been most favourable for the production  of new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal  times; and this we are incapable of doing.
    Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new  species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area  is still more important, especially for the production of species which  shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading  widely.
 Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a  better chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of  individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of  life are much more complex from the large number of already existing  species; and if some of these many species become modified and improved,  others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they  will be exterminated.
 Each new form, also, as soon as it has been much  improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and  will thus come into competition with many other forms.
 Moreover, great  areas, though now continuous, will often, owing to former oscillations  of level, have existed in a broken condition, so that the good effects  of isolation will generally, to a certain extent, have concurred.
  Finally, I conclude that, although small isolated areas have been in  some respects highly favourable for the production of new species, yet  that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on  large areas; and what is more important, that the new forms produced on  large areas, which already have been victorious over many competitors,  will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the  greatest number of new varieties and species.
 They will thus play a more  important part in the changing history of the organic world.
    In accordance with this view, we can, perhaps, understand some  facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on Geographical  Distribution; for instance, the fact of the productions of the  smaller continent of Australia now yielding before those of the larger  Europaeo-Asiatic area.
 Thus, also, it is that continental productions  have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands.
 On a small  island, the race for life will have been less severe, and there will  have been less modification and less extermination.
 Hence, we can  understand how it is that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald  Heer, resembles to a certain extent the extinct tertiary flora of  Europe.
 All fresh water basins, taken together, make a small area  compared with that of the sea or of the land.
 Consequently, the  competition between fresh water productions will have been less severe  than elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly produced, and old  forms more slowly exterminated.
 And it is in fresh water basins that  we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant  order: and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now  known in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like  fossils, connect to a certain extent orders at present widely separated  in the natural scale.
 These anomalous forms may be called living  fossils; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited  a confined area, and from having been exposed to less varied, and  therefore less severe, competition.
    To sum up, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits, the  circumstances favourable and unfavourable for the production of new  species through natural selection.
 I conclude that for terrestrial  productions a large continental area, which has undergone many  oscillations of level, will have been the most favourable for the  production of many new forms of life, fitted to endure for a long  time and to spread widely.
 While the area existed as a continent the  inhabitants will have been numerous in individuals and kinds, and will  have been subjected to severe competition.
 When converted by subsidence  into large separate islands there will still have existed many  individuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the  confines of the range of each new species will have been checked: after  physical changes of any kind immigration will have been prevented, so  that new places in the polity of each island will have had to be filled  up by the modification of the old inhabitants; and time will have been  allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected.
  When, by renewed elevation, the islands were reconverted into a  continental area, there will again have been very severe competition;  the most favoured or improved varieties will have been enabled to  spread; there will have been much extinction of the less improved forms,  and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the  reunited continent will again have been changed; and again there will  have been a fair field for natural selection to improve still further  the inhabitants, and thus to produce new species.
    That natural selection generally act with extreme slowness I fully  admit.
 It can act only when there are places in the natural polity of a  district which can be better occupied by the modification of some of its  existing inhabitants.
 The occurrence of such places will often depend  on physical changes, which generally take place very slowly, and on the  immigration of better adapted forms being prevented.
 As some few of  the old inhabitants become modified the mutual relations of others will  often be disturbed; and this will create new places, ready to be filled  up by better adapted forms; but all this will take place very slowly.
  Although all the individuals of the same species differ in some slight  degree from each other, it would often be long before differences of  the right nature in various parts of the organisation might occur.
 The  result would often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing.
 Many will  exclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient to neutralise the  power of natural selection.
 I do not believe so.
 But I do believe that  natural selection will generally act very slowly, only at long intervals  of time, and only on a few of the inhabitants of the same region.
 I  further believe that these slow, intermittent results accord well with  what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of  the world have changed.
    Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much  by artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change,  to the beauty and complexity of the coadaptations between all organic  beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life,  which may have been effected in the long course of time through nature's  power of selection, that is by the survival of the fittest.
    EXTINCTION CAUSED BY NATURAL SELECTION.
    This subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology; but  it must here be alluded to from being intimately connected with natural  selection.
 Natural selection acts solely through the preservation of  variations in some way advantageous, which consequently endure.
 Owing to  the high geometrical rate of increase of all organic beings, each area  is already fully stocked with inhabitants, and it follows from this,  that as the favoured forms increase in number, so, generally, will the  less favoured decrease and become rare.
 Rarity, as geology tells us,  is the precursor to extinction.
 We can see that any form which  is represented by few individuals will run a good chance of utter  extinction, during great fluctuations in the nature or the seasons, or  from a temporary increase in the number of its enemies.
 But we may go  further than this; for as new forms are produced, unless we admit that  specific forms can go on indefinitely increasing in number, many old  forms must become extinct.
 That the number of specific forms has not  indefinitely increased, geology plainly tells us; and we shall presently  attempt to show why it is that the number of species throughout the  world has not become immeasurably great.
    We have seen that the species which are most numerous in individuals  have the best chance of producing favourable variations within any given  period.
 We have evidence of this, in the facts stated in the second  chapter, showing that it is the common and diffused or dominant species  which offer the greatest number of recorded varieties.
 Hence, rare  species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given  period; they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the  modified and improved descendants of the commoner species.
    From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows,  that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural  selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct.
  The forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing  modification and improvement, will naturally suffer most.
 And we have  seen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most  closely-allied forms,--varieties of the same species, and species of  the same genus or related genera,--which, from having nearly the same  structure, constitution and habits, generally come into the severest  competition with each other.
 Consequently, each new variety or species,  during the progress of its formation, will generally press hardest  on its nearest kindred, and tend to exterminate them.
 We see the same  process of extermination among our domesticated productions, through  the selection of improved forms by man.
 Many curious instances could be  given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep and other animals,  and varieties of flowers, take the place of older and inferior kinds.
 In  Yorkshire, it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were  displaced by the long-horns, and that these "were swept away by the  short-horns" (I quote the words of an agricultural writer) "as if by  some murderous pestilence.
"    DIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.
    The principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high  importance, and explains, as I believe, several important facts.
 In  the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having  somewhat of the character of species--as is shown by the hopeless doubts  in many cases how to rank them--yet certainly differ far less from each  other than do good and distinct species.
 Nevertheless according to my  view, varieties are species in the process of formation, or are, as  I have called them, incipient species.
 How, then, does the lesser  difference between varieties become augmented into the greater  difference between species? That this does habitually happen, we must  infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting  well-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and  parents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined  differences.
 Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety  to differ in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this  variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and  in a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual  and large a degree of difference as that between the species of the same  genus.
    As has always been my practice, I have sought light on this head from  our domestic productions.
 We shall here find something analogous.
 It  will be admitted that the production of races so different as short-horn  and Hereford cattle, race and cart horses, the several breeds of  pigeons, etc.
, could never have been effected by the mere chance  accumulation of similar variations during many successive generations.
  In practice, a fancier is, for instance, struck by a pigeon having a  slightly shorter beak; another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a  rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged principle that "fanciers do  not and will not admire a medium standard, but like extremes," they  both go on (as has actually occurred with the sub-breeds of the  tumbler-pigeon) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer  beaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks.
 Again, we may suppose that at  an early period of history, the men of one nation or district required  swifter horses, while those of another required stronger and bulkier  horses.
 The early differences would be very slight; but, in the course  of time, from the continued selection of swifter horses in the one case,  and of stronger ones in the other, the differences would become greater,  and would be noted as forming two sub-breeds.
 Ultimately after the  lapse of centuries, these sub-breeds would become converted into two  well-established and distinct breeds.
 As the differences became greater,  the inferior animals with intermediate characters, being neither very  swift nor very strong, would not have been used for breeding, and will  thus have tended to disappear.
 Here, then, we see in man's productions  the action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing  differences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and  the breeds to diverge in character, both from each other and from their  common parent.
    But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature?  I believe it can and does apply most efficiently (though it was a long  time before I saw how), from the simple circumstance that the more  diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure,  constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to  seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and  so be enabled to increase in numbers.
    We can clearly discern this in the case of animals with simple habits.
  Take the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can  be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average.
  If its natural power of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in  increasing (the country not undergoing any change in conditions) only by  its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other  animals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds  of prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing  trees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous.
  The more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our  carnivorous animals become, the more places they will be enabled to  occupy.
 What applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to  all animals--that is, if they vary--for otherwise natural selection can  effect nothing.
 So it will be with plants.
 It has been experimentally  proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass,  and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses,  a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can be  raised in the latter than in the former case.
 The same has been found  to hold good when one variety and several mixed varieties of wheat have  been sown on equal spaces of ground.
 Hence, if any one species of grass  were to go on varying, and the varieties were continually selected which  differed from each other in the same manner, though in a very slight  degree, as do the distinct species and genera of grasses, a greater  number of individual plants of this species, including its modified  descendants, would succeed in living on the same piece of ground.
 And  we know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing  almost countless seeds; and is thus striving, as it may be said, to  the utmost to increase in number.
 Consequently, in the course of many  thousand generations, the most distinct varieties of any one species  of grass would have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing  in numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties; and  varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of  species.
    The truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be  supported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many  natural circumstances.
 In an extremely small area, especially if freely  open to immigration, and where the contest between individual and  individual must be very severe, we always find great diversity in its  inhabitants.
 For instance, I found that a piece of turf, three feet by  four in size, which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same  conditions, supported twenty species of plants, and these belonged to  eighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how much these plants  differed from each other.
 So it is with the plants and insects on small  and uniform islets: also in small ponds of fresh water.
 Farmers find  that they can raise more food by a rotation of plants belonging to the  most different orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous  rotation.
 Most of the animals and plants which live close round any  small piece of ground, could live on it (supposing its nature not to be  in any way peculiar), and may be said to be striving to the utmost  to live there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the closest  competition, the advantages of diversification of structure, with the  accompanying differences of habit and constitution, determine that the  inhabitants, which thus jostle each other most closely, shall, as a  general rule, belong to what we call different genera and orders.
    The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man's  agency in foreign lands.
 It might have been expected that the plants  which would succeed in becoming naturalised in any land would generally  have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked  at as specially created and adapted for their own country.
 It might  also, perhaps, have been expected that naturalised plants would have  belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in  their new homes.
 But the case is very different; and Alph.
 de Candolle  has well remarked, in his great and admirable work, that floras gain by  naturalisation, proportionally with the number of the native genera and  species, far more in new genera than in new species.
 To give a single  instance: in the last edition of Dr.
 Asa Gray's "Manual of the Flora of  the Northern United States," 260 naturalised plants are enumerated, and  these belong to 162 genera.
 We thus see that these naturalised plants  are of a highly diversified nature.
 They differ, moreover, to a large  extent, from the indigenes, for out of the 162 naturalised genera,  no less than 100 genera are not there indigenous, and thus a large  proportional addition is made to the genera now living in the United  States.
    By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have in any  country struggled successfully with the indigenes, and have there become  naturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of the  natives would have had to be modified in order to gain an advantage over  their compatriots; and we may at least infer that diversification of  structure, amounting to new generic differences, would be profitable to  them.
    The advantage of diversification of structure in the inhabitants of the  same region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division  of labour in the organs of the same individual body--a subject so well  elucidated by Milne Edwards.
 No physiologist doubts that a stomach by  being adapted to digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws  most nutriment from these substances.
 So in the general economy of  any land, the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are  diversified for different habits of life, so will a greater number of  individuals be capable of there supporting themselves.
 A set of animals,  with their organisation but little diversified, could hardly compete  with a set more perfectly diversified in structure.
 It may be doubted,  for instance, whether the Australian marsupials, which are divided into  groups differing but little from each other, and feebly representing, as  Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and  rodent mammals, could successfully compete with these well-developed  orders.
 In the Australian mammals, we see the process of diversification  in an early and incomplete stage of development.
    THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF THE ACTION OF NATURAL SELECTION THROUGH  DIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER AND EXTINCTION, ON THE DESCENDANTS OF A COMMON  ANCESTOR.
    After the foregoing discussion, which has been much compressed, we may  assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed so  much the better as they become more diversified in structure, and are  thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings.
 Now let  us see how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of  character, combined with the principles of natural selection and of  extinction, tends to act.
    The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather  perplexing subject.
 Let A to L represent the species of a genus large  in its own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other  in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is  represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances.
  I have said a large genus, because as we saw in the second chapter, on  an average more species vary in large genera than in small genera; and  the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of  varieties.
 We have, also, seen that the species, which are the commonest  and most widely-diffused, vary more than do the rare and restricted  species.
 Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying species,  belonging to a genus large in its own country.
 The branching and  diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (A), may  represent its varying offspring.
 The variations are supposed to be  extremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not  supposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of  time; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods.
 Only  those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or  naturally selected.
 And here the importance of the principle of benefit  derived from divergence of character comes in; for this will generally  lead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by  the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural  selection.
 When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines,  and is there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient amount of  variation is supposed to have been accumulated to form it into a fairly  well-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record in a  systematic work.
    The intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent  each a thousand or more generations.
 After a thousand generations,  species (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked  varieties, namely a1 and m1.
 These two varieties will generally still  be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable, and  the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary; consequently they  will likewise tend to vary, and commonly in nearly the same manner as  did their parents.
 Moreover, these two varieties, being only slightly  modified forms, will tend to inherit those advantages which made their  parent (A) more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same  country; they will also partake of those more general advantages which  made the genus to which the parent-species belonged, a large genus  in its own country.
 And all these circumstances are favourable to the  production of new varieties.
    If, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of  their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand  generations.
 And after this interval, variety a1 is supposed in the  diagram to have produced variety a2, which will, owing to the principle  of divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety a1.
 Variety m1 is  supposed to have produced two varieties, namely m2 and s2, differing  from each other, and more considerably from their common parent (A).
 We  may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time; some  of the varieties, after each thousand generations, producing only  a single variety, but in a more and more modified condition, some  producing two or three varieties, and some failing to produce any.
 Thus  the varieties or modified descendants of the common parent (A), will  generally go on increasing in number and diverging in character.
 In the  diagram the process is represented up to the ten-thousandth generation,  and under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteen-thousandth  generation.
    But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes  on so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made  somewhat irregular, nor that it goes on continuously; it is far more  probable that each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then  again undergoes modification.
 Nor do I suppose that the most divergent  varieties are invariably preserved: a medium form may often long endure,  and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant; for  natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places  which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings;  and this will depend on infinitely complex relations.
 But as a general  rule, the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one  species can be rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize  on, and the more their modified progeny will increase.
 In our diagram  the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered  letters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently  distinct to be recorded as varieties.
 But these breaks are imaginary,  and might have been inserted anywhere, after intervals long enough to  allow the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation.
    As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused  species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the  same advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will  generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character:  this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches  proceeding from (A).
 The modified offspring from the later and more  highly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable,  often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and less improved  branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower  branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines.
 In some cases no  doubt the process of modification will be confined to a single line of  descent, and the number of modified descendants will not be increased;  although the amount of divergent modification may have been augmented.
  This case would be represented in the diagram, if all the lines  proceeding from (A) were removed, excepting that from a1 to a10.
 In the  same way the English racehorse and English pointer have apparently  both gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks,  without either having given off any fresh branches or races.
    After ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced  three forms, a10, f10, and m10, which, from having diverged in character  during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, but  perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent.
 If we  suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram  to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only well-marked  varieties; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of  modification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these  three forms into doubtful or at least into well-defined species:  thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences  distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences  distinguishing species.
 By continuing the same process for a greater  number of generations (as shown in the diagram in a condensed and  simplified manner), we get eight species, marked by the letters between  a14 and m14, all descended from (A).
 Thus, as I believe, species are  multiplied and genera are formed.
    In a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary.
  In the diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has produced, by  analogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two well-marked  varieties (w10 and z10) or two species, according to the amount of  change supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines.
 After  fourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters  n14 to z14, are supposed to have been produced.
 In any genus, the  species which are already very different in character from each  other, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified  descendants; for these will have the best chance of seizing on new and  widely different places in the polity of nature: hence in the diagram I  have chosen the extreme species (A), and the nearly extreme species (I),  as those which have largely varied, and have given rise to new varieties  and species.
 The other nine species (marked by capital letters) of our  original genus, may for long but unequal periods continue to transmit  unaltered descendants; and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted  lines unequally prolonged upwards.
    But during the process of modification, represented in the diagram,  another of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played  an important part.
 As in each fully stocked country natural selection  necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the  struggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency in  the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate  in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original  progenitor.
 For it should be remembered that the competition will  generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly  related to each other in habits, constitution and structure.
 Hence all  the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that is  between the less and more improved states of a the same species, as well  as the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become  extinct.
 So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of  descent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines.
 If,  however, the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct  country, or become quickly adapted to some quite new station, in which  offspring and progenitor do not come into competition, both may continue  to exist.
    If, then, our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of  modification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have become  extinct, being replaced by eight new species (a14 to m14); and species  (I) will be replaced by six (n14 to z14) new species.
    But we may go further than this.
 The original species of our genus were  supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally  the case in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to B, C, and  D than to the other species; and species (I) more to G, H, K, L, than to  the others.
 These two species (A and I), were also supposed to be very  common and widely diffused species, so that they must originally have  had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus.
 Their  modified descendants, fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth  generation, will probably have inherited some of the same advantages:  they have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at  each stage of descent, so as to have become adapted to many related  places in the natural economy of their country.
 It seems, therefore,  extremely probable that they will have taken the places of, and thus  exterminated, not only their parents (A) and (I), but likewise some of  the original species which were most nearly related to their parents.
  Hence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring  to the fourteen-thousandth generation.
 We may suppose that only one (F)  of the two species (E and F) which were least closely related to the  other nine original species, has transmitted descendants to this late  stage of descent.
    The new species in our diagram, descended from the original eleven  species, will now be fifteen in number.
 Owing to the divergent tendency  of natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in character  between species a14 and z14 will be much greater than that between the  most distinct of the original eleven species.
 The new species, moreover,  will be allied to each other in a widely different manner.
 Of the eight  descendants from (A) the three marked a14, q14, p14, will be nearly  related from having recently branched off from a10; b14 and f14, from  having diverged at an earlier period from a5, will be in some degree  distinct from the three first-named species; and lastly, o14, e14, and  m14, will be nearly related one to the other, but, from having diverged  at the first commencement of the process of modification, will be widely  different from the other five species, and may constitute a sub-genus or  a distinct genus.
    The six descendants from (I) will form two sub-genera or genera.
 But as  the original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly  at the extreme end of the original genus, the six descendants from (I)  will, owing to inheritance alone, differ considerably from the eight  descendants from (A); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have  gone on diverging in different directions.
 The intermediate species,  also (and this is a very important consideration), which connected the  original species (A) and (I), have all become, except (F), extinct, and  have left no descendants.
 Hence the six new species descended from  (I), and the eight descendants from (A), will have to be ranked as very  distinct genera, or even as distinct sub-families.
    Thus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by  descent with modification, from two or more species of the same genus.
  And the two or more parent-species are supposed to be descended from  some one species of an earlier genus.
 In our diagram this is indicated  by the broken lines beneath the capital letters, converging in  sub-branches downwards towards a single point; this point represents  a species, the supposed progenitor of our several new sub-genera and  genera.
    It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new  species F14, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character,  but to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only  in a slight degree.
 In this case its affinities to the other fourteen  new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature.
 Being descended  from a form that stood between the parent-species (A) and (I),  now supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree  intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these  two species.
 But as these two groups have gone on diverging in character  from the type of their parents, the new species (F14) will not be  directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two  groups; and every naturalist will be able to call such cases before his  mind.
    In the diagram each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to  represent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or  more generations; it may also represent a section of the successive  strata of the earth's crust including extinct remains.
 We shall, when we  come to our chapter on geology, have to refer again to this subject,  and I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the  affinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the  same orders, families, or genera, with those now living, yet are often,  in some degree, intermediate in character between existing groups; and  we can understand this fact, for the extinct species lived at various  remote epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less.
    I see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now explained,  to the formation of genera alone.
 If, in the diagram, we suppose the  amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging  dotted lines to be great, the forms marked a14 to p14, those marked  b14 and f14, and those marked o14 to m14, will form three very distinct  genera.
 We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from (I),  differing widely from the descendants of (A).
 These two groups of genera  will thus form two distinct families, or orders, according to the amount  of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram.
 And  the two new families, or orders, are descended from two species of the  original genus; and these are supposed to be descended from some still  more ancient and unknown form.
    We have seen that in each country it is the species belonging to the  larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species.
  This, indeed, might have been expected; for as natural selection acts  through one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle  for existence, it will chiefly act on those which already have some  advantage; and the largeness of any group shows that its species have  inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common.
 Hence, the  struggle for the production of new and modified descendants will mainly  lie between the larger groups, which are all trying to increase in  number.
 One large group will slowly conquer another large group,  reduce its number, and thus lessen its chance of further variation and  improvement.
 Within the same large group, the later and more highly  perfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing on many new places  in the polity of nature, will constantly tend to supplant and destroy  the earlier and less improved sub-groups.
 Small and broken groups and  sub-groups will finally disappear.
 Looking to the future, we can predict  that the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant,  and which are least broken up, that is, which have as yet suffered least  extinction, will, for a long period, continue to increase.
 But which  groups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we know that  many groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become  extinct.
 Looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict  that, owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups,  a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no  modified descendants; and consequently that, of the species living at  any one period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote  futurity.
 I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on  classification, but I may add that as, according to this view, extremely  few of the more ancient species have transmitted descendants to the  present day, and, as all the descendants of the same species form a  class, we can understand how it is that there exist so few classes in  each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
 Although few of  the most ancient species have left modified descendants, yet, at remote  geological periods, the earth may have been almost as well peopled with  species of many genera, families, orders and classes, as at the present  day.
    ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH ORGANISATION TENDS TO ADVANCE.
    Natural selection acts exclusively by the preservation and accumulation  of variations, which are beneficial under the organic and inorganic  conditions to which each creature is exposed at all periods of life.
  The ultimate result is that each creature tends to become more and more  improved in relation to its conditions.
 This improvement inevitably  leads to the gradual advancement of the organisation of the greater  number of living beings throughout the world.
 But here we enter on a  very intricate subject, for naturalists have not defined to each other's  satisfaction what is meant by an advance in organisation.
 Among the  vertebrata the degree of intellect and an approach in structure to man  clearly come into play.
 It might be thought that the amount of change  which the various parts and organs pass through in their development  from embryo to maturity would suffice as a standard of comparison; but  there are cases, as with certain parasitic crustaceans, in which several  parts of the structure become less perfect, so that the mature animal  cannot be called higher than its larva.
 Von Baer's standard seems  the most widely applicable and the best, namely, the amount of  differentiation of the parts of the same organic being, in the adult  state, as I should be inclined to add, and their specialisation  for different functions; or, as Milne Edwards would express it, the  completeness of the division of physiological labour.
 But we shall see  how obscure this subject is if we look, for instance, to fishes, among  which some naturalists rank those as highest which, like the sharks,  approach nearest to amphibians; while other naturalists rank the common  bony or teleostean fishes as the highest, inasmuch as they are most  strictly fish-like, and differ most from the other vertebrate classes.
  We see still more plainly the obscurity of the subject by turning  to plants, among which the standard of intellect is of course quite  excluded; and here some botanists rank those plants as highest which  have every organ, as sepals, petals, stamens and pistils, fully  developed in each flower; whereas other botanists, probably with more  truth, look at the plants which have their several organs much modified  and reduced in number as the highest.
    If we take as the standard of high organisation, the amount of  differentiation and specialisation of the several organs in each being  when adult (and this will include the advancement of the brain for  intellectual purposes), natural selection clearly leads towards this  standard: for all physiologists admit that the specialisation of organs,  inasmuch as in this state they perform their functions better, is  an advantage to each being; and hence the accumulation of variations  tending towards specialisation is within the scope of natural selection.
  On the other hand, we can see, bearing in mind that all organic  beings are striving to increase at a high ratio and to seize on every  unoccupied or less well occupied place in the economy of nature, that  it is quite possible for natural selection gradually to fit a being to  a situation in which several organs would be superfluous or useless: in  such cases there would be retrogression in the scale of organisation.
  Whether organisation on the whole has actually advanced from the  remotest geological periods to the present day will be more conveniently  discussed in our chapter on Geological Succession.
    But it may be objected that if all organic beings thus tend to rise in  the scale, how is it that throughout the world a multitude of the lowest  forms still exist; and how is it that in each great class some forms  are far more highly developed than others? Why have not the more highly  developed forms every where supplanted and exterminated the lower?  Lamarck, who believed in an innate and inevitable tendency towards  perfection in all organic beings, seems to have felt this difficulty  so strongly that he was led to suppose that new and simple forms are  continually being produced by spontaneous generation.
 Science has not as  yet proved the truth of this belief, whatever the future may reveal.
  On our theory the continued existence of lowly organisms offers no  difficulty; for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does  not necessarily include progressive development--it only takes advantage  of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under  its complex relations of life.
 And it may be asked what advantage,  as far as we can see, would it be to an infusorian animalcule--to an  intestinal worm--or even to an earth-worm, to be highly organised.
 If  it were no advantage, these forms would be left, by natural selection,  unimproved or but little improved, and might remain for indefinite ages  in their present lowly condition.
 And geology tells us that some of  the lowest forms, as the infusoria and rhizopods, have remained for an  enormous period in nearly their present state.
 But to suppose that most  of the many now existing low forms have not in the least advanced since  the first dawn of life would be extremely rash; for every naturalist who  has dissected some of the beings now ranked as very low in the  scale, must have been struck with their really wondrous and beautiful  organisation.
    Nearly the same remarks are applicable, if we look to the different  grades of organisation within the same great group; for instance, in the  vertebrata, to the co-existence of mammals and fish--among mammalia, to  the co-existence of man and the ornithorhynchus--among fishes, to the  co-existence of the shark and the lancelet (Amphioxus), which latter  fish in the extreme simplicity of its structure approaches the  invertebrate classes.
 But mammals and fish hardly come into competition  with each other; the advancement of the whole class of mammals, or of  certain members in this class, to the highest grade would not lead to  their taking the place of fishes.
 Physiologists believe that the brain  must be bathed by warm blood to be highly active, and this requires  aerial respiration; so that warm-blooded mammals when inhabiting the  water lie under a disadvantage in having to come continually to the  surface to breathe.
 With fishes, members of the shark family would not  tend to supplant the lancelet; for the lancelet, as I hear from Fritz  Muller, has as sole companion and competitor on the barren sandy shore  of South Brazil, an anomalous annelid.
 The three lowest orders of  mammals, namely, marsupials, edentata, and rodents, co-exist in South  America in the same region with numerous monkeys, and probably interfere  little with each other.
 Although organisation, on the whole, may have  advanced and be still advancing throughout the world, yet the scale will  always present many degrees of perfection; for the high advancement of  certain whole classes, or of certain members of each class, does not at  all necessarily lead to the extinction of those groups with which  they do not enter into close competition.
 In some cases, as we shall  hereafter see, lowly organised forms appear to have been preserved to  the present day, from inhabiting confined or peculiar stations, where  they have been subjected to less severe competition, and where their  scanty numbers have retarded the chance of favourable variations  arising.
    Finally, I believe that many lowly organised forms now exist throughout  the world, from various causes.
 In some cases variations or individual  differences of a favourable nature may never have arisen for natural  selection to act on and accumulate.
 In no case, probably, has time  sufficed for the utmost possible amount of development.
 In some few  cases there has been what we must call retrogression or organisation.
  But the main cause lies in the fact that under very simple conditions  of life a high organisation would be of no service--possibly would be of  actual disservice, as being of a more delicate nature, and more liable  to be put out of order and injured.
    Looking to the first dawn of life, when all organic beings, as we may  believe, presented the simplest structure, how, it has been asked,  could the first step in the advancement or differentiation of parts  have arisen? Mr. Herbert Spencer would probably answer that, as soon as  simple unicellular organisms came by growth or division to be compounded  of several cells, or became attached to any supporting surface, his law  "that homologous units of any order become differentiated in proportion  as their relations to incident forces become different" would come into  action.
 But as we have no facts to guide us, speculation on the subject  is almost useless.
 It is, however, an error to suppose that there would  be no struggle for existence, and, consequently, no natural selection,  until many forms had been produced: variations in a single species  inhabiting an isolated station might be beneficial, and thus the whole  mass of individuals might be modified, or two distinct forms might  arise.
 But, as I remarked towards the close of the introduction, no  one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained on the  origin of species, if we make due allowance for our profound ignorance  on the mutual relations of the inhabitants of the world at the present  time, and still more so during past ages.
    CONVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.
    Mr. H.
C.
 Watson thinks that I have overrated the importance of  divergence of character (in which, however, he apparently believes), and  that convergence, as it may be called, has likewise played a part.
 If  two species belonging to two distinct though allied genera, had both  produced a large number of new and divergent forms, it is conceivable  that these might approach each other so closely that they would have  all to be classed under the same genus; and thus the descendants of two  distinct genera would converge into one.
 But it would in most cases  be extremely rash to attribute to convergence a close and general  similarity of structure in the modified descendants of widely distinct  forms.
 The shape of a crystal is determined solely by the molecular  forces, and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances should  sometimes assume the same form; but with organic beings we should  bear in mind that the form of each depends on an infinitude of complex  relations, namely on the variations which have arisen, these being due  to causes far too intricate to be followed out--on the nature of the  variations which have been preserved or selected, and this depends on  the surrounding physical conditions, and in a still higher degree on  the surrounding organisms with which each being has come into  competition--and lastly, on inheritance (in itself a fluctuating  element) from innumerable progenitors, all of which have had their forms  determined through equally complex relations.
 It is incredible that the  descendants of two organisms, which had originally differed in a marked  manner, should ever afterwards converge so closely as to lead to a near  approach to identity throughout their whole organisation.
 If this had  occurred, we should meet with the same form, independently of genetic  connection, recurring in widely separated geological formations; and the  balance of evidence is opposed to any such an admission.
    Mr. Watson has also objected that the continued action of natural  selection, together with divergence of character, would tend to make an  indefinite number of specific forms.
 As far as mere inorganic conditions  are concerned, it seems probable that a sufficient number of species  would soon become adapted to all considerable diversities of heat,  moisture, etc.
; but I fully admit that the mutual relations of organic  beings are more important; and as the number of species in any country  goes on increasing, the organic conditions of life must become more and  more complex.
 Consequently there seems at first no limit to the amount  of profitable diversification of structure, and therefore no limit to  the number of species which might be produced.
 We do not know that even  the most prolific area is fully stocked with specific forms: at the Cape  of Good Hope and in Australia, which support such an astonishing number  of species, many European plants have become naturalised.
 But geology  shows us, that from an early part of the tertiary period the number of  species of shells, and that from the middle part of this same period,  the number of mammals has not greatly or at all increased.
 What then  checks an indefinite increase in the number of species? The amount of  life (I do not mean the number of specific forms) supported on an  area must have a limit, depending so largely as it does on physical  conditions; therefore, if an area be inhabited by very many species,  each or nearly each species will be represented by few individuals;  and such species will be liable to extermination from accidental  fluctuations in the nature of the seasons or in the number of their  enemies.
 The process of extermination in such cases would be rapid,  whereas the production of new species must always be slow.
 Imagine the  extreme case of as many species as individuals in England, and the  first severe winter or very dry summer would exterminate thousands on  thousands of species.
 Rare species, and each species will become rare  if the number of species in any country becomes indefinitely increased,  will, on the principal often explained, present within a given period  few favourable variations; consequently, the process of giving birth to  new specific forms would thus be retarded.
 When any species becomes  very rare, close interbreeding will help to exterminate it; authors have  thought that this comes into play in accounting for the deterioration  of the aurochs in Lithuania, of red deer in Scotland and of bears  in Norway, etc.
 Lastly, and this I am inclined to think is the most  important element, a dominant species, which has already beaten many  competitors in its own home, will tend to spread and supplant many  others.
 Alph.
 de Candolle has shown that those species which spread  widely tend generally to spread VERY widely, consequently they will tend  to supplant and exterminate several species in several areas, and thus  check the inordinate increase of specific forms throughout the world.
  Dr.
 Hooker has recently shown that in the southeast corner of Australia,  where, apparently, there are many invaders from different quarters of  the globe, the endemic Australian species have been greatly reduced in  number.
 How much weight to attribute to these several considerations I  will not pretend to say; but conjointly they must limit in each country  the tendency to an indefinite augmentation of specific forms.
    SUMMARY OF CHAPTER.
    If under changing conditions of life organic beings present individual  differences in almost every part of their structure, and this cannot be  disputed; if there be, owing to their geometrical rate of increase, a  severe struggle for life at some age, season or year, and this certainly  cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the  relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions  of life, causing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and  habits, to be advantageous to them, it would be a most extraordinary  fact if no variations had ever occurred useful to each being's own  welfare, in the same manner as so many variations have occurred useful  to man.
 But if variations useful to any organic being ever do occur,  assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of  being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle  of inheritance, these will tend to produce offspring similarly  characterised.
 This principle of preservation, or the survival of the  fittest, I have called natural selection.
 It leads to the improvement  of each creature in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of  life; and consequently, in most cases, to what must be regarded as an  advance in organisation.
 Nevertheless, low and simple forms will long  endure if well fitted for their simple conditions of life.
    Natural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at  corresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young as easily as the  adult.
 Among many animals sexual selection will have given its aid to  ordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted  males the greatest number of offspring.
 Sexual selection will also give  characters useful to the males alone in their struggles or rivalry with  other males; and these characters will be transmitted to one sex or to  both sexes, according to the form of inheritance which prevails.
    Whether natural selection has really thus acted in adapting the various  forms of life to their several conditions and stations, must be judged  by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following  chapters.
 But we have already seen how it entails extinction; and how  largely extinction has acted in the world's history, geology plainly  declares.
 Natural selection, also, leads to divergence of character; for  the more organic beings diverge in structure, habits and constitution,  by so much the more can a large number be supported on the area, of  which we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any small spot, and  to the productions naturalised in foreign lands.
 Therefore, during  the modification of the descendants of any one species, and during  the incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers, the more  diversified the descendants become, the better will be their chance  of success in the battle for life.
 Thus the small differences  distinguishing varieties of the same species, steadily tend to increase,  till they equal the greater differences between species of the same  genus, or even of distinct genera.
    We have seen that it is the common, the widely diffused, and widely  ranging species, belonging to the larger genera within each class, which  vary most; and these tend to transmit to their modified offspring  that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries.
  Natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of  character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate  forms of life.
 On these principles, the nature of the affinities, and  the generally well defined distinctions between the innumerable organic  beings in each class throughout the world, may be explained.
 It is a  truly wonderful fact--the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from  familiarity--that all animals and all plants throughout all time and  space should be related to each other in groups, subordinate to groups,  in the manner which we everywhere behold--namely, varieties of the same  species most closely related, species of the same genus less closely and  unequally related, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct  genera much less closely related, and genera related in different  degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and  classes.
 The several subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked  in a single file, but seem clustered round points, and these round  other points, and so on in almost endless cycles.
 If species had been  independently created, no explanation would have been possible of this  kind of classification; but it is explained through inheritance and the  complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and divergence  of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.
    The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been  represented by a great tree.
 I believe this simile largely speaks the  truth.
 The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and  those produced during former years may represent the long succession  of extinct species.
 At each period of growth all the growing twigs  have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the  surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups  of species have at all times overmastered other species in the great  battle for life.
 The limbs divided into great branches, and these into  lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was  young, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present  buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all  extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups.
 Of the many  twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three,  now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear the other branches;  so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods,  very few have left living and modified descendants.
 From the first  growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off;  and these fallen branches of various sizes may represent those whole  orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives,  and which are known to us only in a fossil state.
 As we here and there  see a thin, straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree,  and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its  summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or  Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities two  large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal  competition by having inhabited a protected station.
 As buds give rise  by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop  on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has  been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken  branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its  ever-branching and beautiful ramifications.
          .
 LAWS OF VARIATION.
     Effects of changed conditions--Use and disuse, combined with natural   selection; organs of flight and of vision--Acclimatisation--Correlated   variation--Compensation and economy of growth--False   correlations--Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures   variable--Parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable:   specific characters more variable than generic: secondary sexual   characters variable--Species of the same genus vary in an analogous   manner--Reversions to long-lost characters--Summary.
      I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations--so common and  multiform with organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser  degree with those under nature--were due to chance.
 This, of course is  a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly  our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation.
 Some authors  believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to  produce individual differences, or slight deviations of structure, as  to make the child like its parents.
 But the fact of variations and  monstrosities occurring much more frequently under domestication than  under nature, and the greater variability of species having wide ranges  than of those with restricted ranges, lead to the conclusion that  variability is generally related to the conditions of life to which each  species has been exposed during several successive generations.
 In the  first  attempted to show that changed conditions act in two  ways, directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone, and  indirectly through the reproductive system.
 In all cases there are two  factors, the nature of the organism, which is much the most important of  the two, and the nature of the conditions.
 The direct action of changed  conditions leads to definite or indefinite results.
 In the latter case  the organisation seems to become plastic, and we have much fluctuating  variability.
 In the former case the nature of the organism is such that  it yields readily, when subjected to certain conditions, and all, or  nearly all, the individuals become modified in the same way.
    It is very difficult to decide how far changed conditions, such as of  climate, food, etc.
, have acted in a definite manner.
 There is reason  to believe that in the course of time the effects have been greater than  can be proved by clear evidence.
 But we may safely conclude that the  innumerable complex co-adaptations of structure, which we see throughout  nature between various organic beings, cannot be attributed simply to  such action.
 In the following cases the conditions seem to have produced  some slight definite effect: E.
 Forbes asserts that shells at their  southern limit, and when living in shallow water, are more brightly  coloured than those of the same species from further north or from a  greater depth; but this certainly does not always hold good.
 Mr. Gould  believes that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under  a clear atmosphere, than when living near the coast or on islands; and  Wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects the colours  of insects.
 Moquin-Tandon gives a list of plants which, when growing  near the sea-shore, have their leaves in some degree fleshy, though not  elsewhere fleshy.
 These slightly varying organisms are interesting in  as far as they present characters analogous to those possessed by the  species which are confined to similar conditions.
    When a variation is of the slightest use to any being, we cannot tell  how much to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection,  and how much to the definite action of the conditions of life.
 Thus, it  is well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker  and better fur the further north they live; but who can tell how much of  this difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having been  favoured and preserved during many generations, and how much to the  action of the severe climate? For it would appear that climate has some  direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.
    Instances could be given of similar varieties being produced from the  same species under external conditions of life as different as can well  be conceived; and, on the other hand, of dissimilar varieties being  produced under apparently the same external conditions.
 Again,  innumerable instances are known to every naturalist, of species keeping  true, or not varying at all, although living under the most opposite  climates.
 Such considerations as these incline me to lay less weight on  the direct action of the surrounding conditions, than on a tendency to  vary, due to causes of which we are quite ignorant.
    In one sense the conditions of life may be said, not only to cause  variability, either directly or indirectly, but likewise to include  natural selection, for the conditions determine whether this or that  variety shall survive.
 But when man is the selecting agent, we clearly  see that the two elements of change are distinct; variability is in  some manner excited, but it is the will of man which accumulates the  variations in certain direction; and it is this latter agency which  answers to the survival of the fittest under nature.
    EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS, AS CONTROLLED BY  NATURAL SELECTION.
    From the facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there can be  no doubt that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and enlarged  certain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that such modifications  are inherited.
 Under free nature we have no standard of comparison by  which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse, for we  know not the parent-forms; but many animals possess structures which  can be best explained by the effects of disuse.
 As Professor Owen has  remarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot  fly; yet there are several in this state.
 The logger-headed duck of  South America can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its  wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck: it is  a remarkable fact that the young birds, according to Mr. Cunningham, can  fly, while the adults have lost this power.
 As the larger ground-feeding  birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, it is probable that  the nearly wingless condition of several birds, now inhabiting or which  lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beasts of prey,  has been caused by disuse.
 The ostrich indeed inhabits continents, and  is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight, but it  can defend itself, by kicking its enemies, as efficiently as many  quadrupeds.
 We may believe that the progenitor of the ostrich genus had  habits like those of the bustard, and that, as the size and weight of  its body were increased during successive generations, its legs were  used more and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight.
    Kirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the anterior  tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are often broken off;  he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one had  even a relic left.
 In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually  lost that the insect has been described as not having them.
 In some  other genera they are present, but in a rudimentary condition.
 In the  Ateuchus or sacred beetle of the Egyptians, they are totally deficient.
  The evidence that accidental mutilations can be inherited is at present  not decisive; but the remarkable cases observed by Brown-Sequard in  guinea-pigs, of the inherited effects of operations, should make us  cautious in denying this tendency.
 Hence, it will perhaps be safest to  look at the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus, and their  rudimentary condition in some other genera, not as cases of inherited  mutilations, but as due to the effects of long-continued disuse; for  as many dung-feeding beetles are generally found with their tarsi lost,  this must happen early in life; therefore the tarsi cannot be of much  importance or be much used by these insects.
    In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of  structure which are wholly, or mainly due to natural selection.
 Mr.  Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of  the 550 species (but more are now known) inhabiting Madeira, are so far  deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that, of the twenty-nine  endemic genera, no less than twenty-three have all their species in  this condition! Several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of the  world are very frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in  Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the  wind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles  is larger on the exposed Desertas than in Madeira itself; and especially  the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, that  certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, which  absolutely require the use of their wings, are here almost entirely  absent.
 These several considerations make me believe that the wingless  condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of  natural selection, combined probably with disuse.
 For during many  successive generations each individual beetle which flew least, either  from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or  from indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving from not  being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles which most  readily took to flight would oftenest have been blown to sea, and thus  destroyed.
    The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as  certain flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use  their wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects,  their wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged.
 This is quite  compatible with the action of natural selection.
 For when a new insect  first arrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to  enlarge or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater number  of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds, or  by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying.
 As with mariners  shipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the good  swimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it would  have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim  at all and had stuck to the wreck.
    The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size,  and in some cases are quite covered by skin and fur.
 This state of the  eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided  perhaps by natural selection.
 In South America, a burrowing rodent, the  tuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the  mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that  they were frequently blind.
 One which I kept alive was certainly in  this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been  inflammation of the nictitating membrane.
 As frequent inflammation of  the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not  necessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their  size, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them,  might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would  aid the effects of disuse.
    It is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different  classes, which inhabit the caves of Carniola and Kentucky, are blind.
 In  some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is  gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with  its glasses has been lost.
 As it is difficult to imagine that eyes,  though useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in  darkness, their loss may be attributed to disuse.
 In one of the blind  animals, namely, the cave-rat (Neotoma), two of which were captured by  Professor Silliman at above half a mile distance from the mouth of  the cave, and therefore not in the profoundest depths, the eyes were  lustrous and of large size; and these animals, as I am informed by  Professor Silliman, after having been exposed for about a month to a  graduated light, acquired a dim perception of objects.
    It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep  limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that, in accordance  with the old view of the blind animals having been separately created  for the American and European caverns, very close similarity in their  organisation and affinities might have been expected.
 This is certainly  not the case if we look at the two whole faunas; with respect to the  insects alone, Schiodte has remarked: "We are accordingly prevented  from considering the entire phenomenon in any other light than something  purely local, and the similarity which is exhibited in a few forms  between the Mammoth Cave (in Kentucky) and the caves in Carniola,  otherwise than as a very plain expression of that analogy which subsists  generally between the fauna of Europe and of North America.
" On my view  we must suppose that American animals, having in most cases ordinary  powers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the  outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves,  as did European animals into the caves of Europe.
 We have some evidence  of this gradation of habit; for, as Schiodte remarks: "We accordingly  look upon the subterranean faunas as small ramifications which have  penetrated into the earth from the geographically limited faunas of the  adjacent tracts, and which, as they extended themselves into darkness,  have been accommodated to surrounding circumstances.
 Animals not  far remote from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from light to  darkness.
 Next follow those that are constructed for twilight; and, last  of all, those destined for total darkness, and whose formation is quite  peculiar.
" These remarks of Schiodte's it should be understood, apply  not to the same, but to distinct species.
 By the time that an animal had  reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse  will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and  natural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an  increase in the length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation for  blindness.
 Notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to  see in the cave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants  of that continent, and in those of Europe to the inhabitants of the  European continent.
 And this is the case with some of the American  cave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the European  cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding  country.
 It would be difficult to give any rational explanation of the  affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the  two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation.
 That  several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds should  be closely related, we might expect from the well-known relationship  of most of their other productions.
 As a blind species of Bathyscia is  found in abundance on shady rocks far from caves, the loss of vision in  the cave species of this one genus has probably had no relation to its  dark habitation; for it is natural that an insect already deprived of  vision should readily become adapted to dark caverns.
 Another blind  genus (Anophthalmus) offers this remarkable peculiarity, that the  species, as Mr. Murray observes, have not as yet been found anywhere  except in caves; yet those which inhabit the several caves of Europe and  America are distinct; but it is possible that the progenitors of these  several species, while they were furnished with eyes, may formerly have  ranged over both continents, and then have become extinct, excepting in  their present secluded abodes.
 Far from feeling surprise that some of  the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in  regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the  blind Proteus, with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only  surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,  owing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of  these dark abodes will have been exposed.
    ACCLIMATISATION.
    Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the  time of sleep, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate,  etc.
, and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation.
 As it  is extremely common for distinct species belonging to the same genus to  inhabit hot and cold countries, if it be true that all the species of  the same genus are descended from a single parent-form, acclimatisation  must be readily effected during a long course of descent.
 It is  notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home:  species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a  tropical climate, or conversely.
 So again, many succulent plants cannot  endure a damp climate.
 But the degree of adaptation of species to the  climates under which they live is often overrated.
 We may infer this  from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant  will endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals  brought from different countries which are here perfectly healthy.
 We  have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are closely  limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite  as much as, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates.
 But  whether or not this adaptation is in most cases very close, we have  evidence with some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent,  naturally habituated to different temperatures; that is, they become  acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed  collected by Dr.
 Hooker from the same species growing at different  heights on the Himalayas, were found to possess in this country  different constitutional powers of resisting cold.
 Mr. Thwaites informs  me that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon; analogous observations  have been made by Mr. H.
C.
 Watson on European species of plants brought  from the Azores to England; and I could give other cases.
 In regard to  animals, several authentic instances could be adduced of species having  largely extended, within historical times, their range from warmer to  colder latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively know that  these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, though in  all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we know that  they have subsequently become specially acclimatised to their new homes,  so as to be better fitted for them than they were at first.
    As we may infer that our domestic animals were originally chosen by  uncivilised man because they were useful, and because they bred readily  under confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable  of far-extended transportation, the common and extraordinary capacity  in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different  climates, but of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test) under  them, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other  animals now in a state of nature could easily be brought to bear widely  different climates.
 We must not, however, push the foregoing argument  too far, on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic  animals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a tropical  and arctic wolf may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds.
 The rat  and mouse cannot be considered as domestic animals, but they have been  transported by man to many parts of the world, and now have a far wider  range than any other rodent; for they live under the cold climate of  Faroe in the north and of the Falklands in the south, and on many an  island in the torrid zones.
 Hence adaptation to any special climate may  be looked at as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility  of constitution, common to most animals.
 On this view, the capacity of  enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic  animals, and the fact of the extinct elephant and rhinoceros having  formerly endured a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now  all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked  at as anomalies, but as examples of a very common flexibility of  constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into action.
    How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is  due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties  having different innate constitutions, and how much to both means  combined, is an obscure question.
 That habit or custom has some  influence, I must believe, both from analogy and from the incessant  advice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient Encyclopaedias  of China, to be very cautious in transporting animals from one district  to another.
 And as it is not likely that man should have succeeded in  selecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially  fitted for their own districts, the result must, I think, be due to  habit.
 On the other hand, natural selection would inevitably tend to  preserve those individuals which were born with constitutions best  adapted to any country which they inhabited.
 In treatises on many kinds  of cultivated plants, certain varieties are said to withstand certain  climates better than others; this is strikingly shown in works on  fruit-trees published in the United States, in which certain varieties  are habitually recommended for the northern and others for the southern  states; and as most of these varieties are of recent origin, they cannot  owe their constitutional differences to habit.
 The case of the Jerusalem  artichoke, which is never propagated in England by seed, and of which,  consequently, new varieties have not been produced, has even been  advanced, as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected, for it  is now as tender as ever it was! The case, also, of the kidney-bean has  been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater weight;  but until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his  kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by  frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care  to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these  seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to  have been even tried.
 Nor let it be supposed that differences in the  constitution of seedling kidney-beans never appear, for an account has  been published how much more hardy some seedlings are than others; and  of this fact I have myself observed striking instances.
    On the whole, we may conclude that habit, or use and disuse, have,  in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the  constitution and structure; but that the effects have often been largely  combined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of  innate variations.
    CORRELATED VARIATION.
    I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied  together, during its growth and development, that when slight variations  in any one part occur and are accumulated through natural selection,  other parts become modified.
 This is a very important subject, most  imperfectly understood, and no doubt wholly different classes of facts  may be here easily confounded together.
 We shall presently see that  simple inheritance often gives the false appearance of correlation.
 One  of the most obvious real cases is, that variations of structure arising  in the young or larvae naturally tend to affect the structure of the  mature animal.
 The several parts which are homologous, and which, at  an early embryonic period, are identical in structure, and which are  necessarily exposed to similar conditions, seem eminently liable to vary  in a like manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body  varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the  jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed by some  anatomists to be homologous with the limbs.
 These tendencies, I do not  doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection:  thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and  if this had been of any great use to the breed, it might probably have  been rendered permanent by natural selection.
    Homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere;  this is often seen in monstrous plants: and nothing is more common than  the union of homologous parts in normal structures, as in the union of  the petals into a tube.
 Hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining  soft parts; it is believed by some authors that with birds the diversity  in the shape of the pelvis causes the remarkable diversity in the shape  of the kidneys.
 Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human  mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child.
 In  snakes, according to Schlegel, the shape of the body and the manner  of swallowing determine the position and form of several of the most  important viscera.
    The nature of the bond is frequently quite obscure.

 Geoffroy St.
  Hilaire has forcibly remarked that certain malconformations frequently,  and that others rarely, coexist without our being able to assign any  reason.
 What can be more singular than the relation in cats between  complete whiteness and blue eyes with deafness, or between the  tortoise-shell colour and the female sex; or in pigeons, between their  feathered feet and skin betwixt the outer toes, or between the presence  of more or less down on the young pigeon when first hatched, with the  future colour of its plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair  and the teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here no doubt homology  comes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I  think it can hardly be accidental that the two orders of mammals which  are most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz.
, Cetacea (whales) and  Edentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, etc.
), are likewise on the  whole the most abnormal in their teeth, but there are so many exceptions  to this rule, as Mr. Mivart has remarked, that it has little value.
    I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of  correlation and variation, independently of utility, and therefore of  natural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and  inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants.
 Everyone is  familiar with the difference between the ray and central florets of, for  instance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the  partial or complete abortion of the reproductive organs.
 But in some  of these plants the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture.
 These  differences have sometimes been attributed to the pressure of the  involucra on the florets, or to their mutual pressure, and the shape of  the seeds in the ray-florets of some Compositae countenances this idea;  but with the Umbelliferae it is by no means, as Dr.
 Hooker informs me,  the species with the densest heads which most frequently differ in their  inner and outer flowers.
 It might have been thought that the development  of the ray-petals, by drawing nourishment from the reproductive organs  causes their abortion; but this can hardly be the sole case, for in some  Compositae the seeds of the outer and inner florets differ, without any  difference in the corolla.
 Possibly these several differences may be  connected with the different flow of nutriment towards the central and  external flowers.
 We know, at least, that with irregular flowers those  nearest to the axis are most subject to peloria, that is to become  abnormally symmetrical.
 I may add, as an instance of this fact, and as  a striking case of correlation, that in many pelargoniums the two upper  petals in the central flower of the truss often lose their patches  of darker colour; and when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite  aborted, the central flower thus becoming peloric or regular.
 When the  colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals, the nectary is  not quite aborted but is much shortened.
    With respect to the development of the corolla, Sprengel's idea that  the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly  advantageous, or necessary for the fertilisation of these plants, is  highly probable; and if so, natural selection may have come into  play.
 But with respect to the seeds, it seems impossible that their  differences in shape, which are not always correlated with any  difference in the corolla, can be in any way beneficial; yet in the  Umbelliferae these differences are of such apparent importance--the  seeds being sometimes orthospermous in the exterior flowers and  coelospermous in the central flowers--that the elder De Candolle founded  his main divisions in the order on such characters.
 Hence modifications  of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due  to the laws of variation and correlation, without being, as far as we  can judge, of the slightest service to the species.
    We may often falsely attribute to correlated variation structures which  are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply  due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through  natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after  thousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and  these two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of  descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be in  some necessary manner correlated.
 Some other correlations are apparently  due to the manner in which natural selection can alone act.
 For  instance, Alph.
 De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never  found in fruits which do not open; I should explain this rule by  the impossibility of seeds gradually becoming winged through natural  selection, unless the capsules were open; for in this case alone could  the seeds, which were a little better adapted to be wafted by the wind,  gain an advantage over others less well fitted for wide dispersal.
    COMPENSATION AND ECONOMY OF GROWTH.
    The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same time, their  law of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe expressed  it, "in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on  the other side.
" I think this holds true to a certain extent with our  domestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in  excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it is  difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily.
 The same  varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage  and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds.
 When the seeds in our fruits  become atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality.
  In our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally  accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by diminished  wattles.
 With species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained  that the law is of universal application; but many good observers, more  especially botanists, believe in its truth.
 I will not, however, here  give any instances, for I see hardly any way of distinguishing between  the effects, on the one hand, of a part being largely developed through  natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by the  same process or by disuse, and, on the other hand, the actual withdrawal  of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and  adjoining part.
    I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been  advanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more  general principle, namely, that natural selection is continually  trying to economise in every part of the organisation.
 If under changed  conditions of life a structure, before useful, becomes less useful, its  diminution will be favoured, for it will profit the individual not to  have its nutriment wasted in building up a useless structure.
 I can  thus only understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining  cirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely,  that when a cirripede is parasitic within another cirripede and is thus  protected, it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace.
  This is the case with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner  with the Proteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists  of the three highly important anterior segments of the head enormously  developed, and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but in the  parasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the  head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the  prehensile antennae.
 Now the saving of a large and complex structure,  when rendered superfluous, would be a decided advantage to each  successive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life  to which every animal is exposed, each would have a better chance of  supporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted.
    Thus, as I believe, natural selection will tend in the long run to  reduce any part of the organisation, as soon as it becomes, through  changed habits, superfluous, without by any means causing some other  part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree.
 And conversely,  that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing  an organ without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of  some adjoining part.
    MULTIPLE, RUDIMENTARY, AND LOWLY-ORGANISED STRUCTURES ARE VARIABLE.
    It seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is.
 Geoffroy St.
 Hilaire, both  with varieties and species, that when any part or organ is repeated  many times in the same individual (as the vertebrae in snakes, and the  stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the  number of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers,  is constant.
 The same author as well as some botanists, have further  remarked that multiple parts are extremely liable to vary in structure.
  As "vegetative repetition," to use Professor Owen's expression, is  a sign of low organisation; the foregoing statements accord with the  common opinion of naturalists, that beings which stand low in the scale  of nature are more variable than those which are higher.
 I presume that  lowness here means that the several parts of the organisation have been  but little specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same  part has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it  should remain variable, that is, why natural selection should not have  preserved or rejected each little deviation of form so carefully as when  the part has to serve for some one special purpose.
 In the same way that  a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape;  whilst a tool for some particular purpose must be of some particular  shape.
 Natural selection, it should never be forgotten, can act solely  through and for the advantage of each being.
    Rudimentary parts, as is generally admitted, are apt to be highly  variable.
 We shall have to recur to this subject; and I will here only  add that their variability seems to result from their uselessness,  and consequently from natural selection having had no power to check  deviations in their structure.
    A PART DEVELOPED IN ANY SPECIES IN AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OR MANNER,  IN COMPARISON WITH THE SAME PART IN ALLIED SPECIES, TENDS TO BE HIGHLY  VARIABLE.
    Several years ago I was much struck by a remark to the above effect made  by Mr. Waterhouse.
 Professor Owen, also, seems to have come to a nearly  similar conclusion.
 It is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the  truth of the above proposition without giving the long array of facts  which I have collected, and which cannot possibly be here introduced.
 I  can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality.
 I  am aware of several causes of error, but I hope that I have made due  allowances for them.
 It should be understood that the rule by no means  applies to any part, however unusually developed, unless it be unusually  developed in one species or in a few species in comparison with the same  part in many closely allied species.
 Thus, the wing of the bat is a most  abnormal structure in the class of mammals; but the rule would not apply  here, because the whole group of bats possesses wings; it would apply  only if some one species had wings developed in a remarkable manner in  comparison with the other species of the same genus.
 The rule applies  very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters, when displayed  in any unusual manner.
 The term, secondary sexual characters, used by  Hunter, relates to characters which are attached to one sex, but are  not directly connected with the act of reproduction.
 The rule applies  to males and females; but more rarely to females, as they seldom offer  remarkable secondary sexual characters.
 The rule being so plainly  applicable in the case of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the  great variability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any  unusual manner--of which fact I think there can be little doubt.
 But  that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly  shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; I particularly attended  to Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this order, and I am  fully convinced that the rule almost always holds good.
 I shall, in a  future work, give a list of all the more remarkable cases.
 I will here  give only one, as it illustrates the rule in its largest application.
  The opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in  every sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ  extremely little even in distinct genera; but in the several species  of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of  diversification; the homologous valves in the different species being  sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the  individuals of the same species is so great that it is no exaggeration  to state that the varieties of the same species differ more from each  other in the characters derived from these important organs, than do the  species belonging to other distinct genera.
    As with birds the individuals of the same species, inhabiting the same  country, vary extremely little, I have particularly attended to them;  and the rule certainly seems to hold good in this class.
 I cannot make  out that it applies to plants, and this would have seriously shaken my  belief in its truth, had not the great variability in plants made it  particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability.
    When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner  in a species, the fair presumption is that it is of high importance  to that species: nevertheless it is in this case eminently liable to  variation.
 Why should this be so? On the view that each species has been  independently created, with all its parts as we now see them, I can see  no explanation.
 But on the view that groups of species are descended  from some other species, and have been modified through natural  selection, I think we can obtain some light.
 First let me make some  preliminary remarks.
 If, in our domestic animals, any part or the  whole animal be neglected, and no selection be applied, that part (for  instance, the comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to  have a uniform character: and the breed may be said to be degenerating.
  In rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but little  specialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic  groups, we see a nearly parallel case; for in such cases natural  selection either has not or cannot come into full play, and thus the  organisation is left in a fluctuating condition.
 But what here more  particularly concerns us is, that those points in our domestic animals,  which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by continued  selection, are also eminently liable to variation.
 Look at the  individuals of the same breed of the pigeon; and see what a prodigious  amount of difference there is in the beak of tumblers, in the beak and  wattle of carriers, in the carriage and tail of fantails, etc.
, these  being the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers.
 Even in the  same sub-breed, as in that of the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously  difficult to breed nearly perfect birds, many departing widely from the  standard.
 There may truly be said to be a constant struggle going on  between, on the one hand, the tendency to reversion to a less perfect  state, as well as an innate tendency to new variations, and, on the  other hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed true.
 In  the long run selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so  completely as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler pigeon from  a good short-faced strain.
 But as long as selection is rapidly going  on, much variability in the parts undergoing modification may always be  expected.
    Now let us turn to nature.
 When a part has been developed in an  extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species  of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an  extraordinary amount of modification since the period when the several  species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus.
 This  period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species rarely  endure for more than one geological period.
 An extraordinary amount of  modification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of  variability, which has continually been accumulated by natural  selection for the benefit of the species.
 But as the variability of  the extraordinarily developed part or organ has been so great and  long-continued within a period not excessively remote, we might, as a  general rule, still expect to find more variability in such parts than  in other parts of the organisation which have remained for a much longer  period nearly constant.
 And this, I am convinced, is the case.
 That the  struggle between natural selection on the one hand, and the tendency to  reversion and variability on the other hand, will in the course of  time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made  constant, I see no reason to doubt.
 Hence, when an organ, however  abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the same  condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing of  the bat, it must have existed, according to our theory, for an immense  period in nearly the same state; and thus it has come not to be more  variable than any other structure.
 It is only in those cases in which  the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great  that we ought to find the GENERATIVE VARIABILITY, as it may be called,  still present in a high degree.
 For in this case the variability  will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the  individuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the  continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less  modified condition.
    SPECIFIC CHARACTERS MORE VARIABLE THAN GENERIC CHARACTERS.
    The principle discussed under the last heading may be applied to our  present subject.
 It is notorious that specific characters are more  variable than generic.
 To explain by a simple example what is meant: if  in a large genus of plants some species had blue flowers and some had  red, the colour would be only a specific character, and no one would be  surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely;  but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become  a generic character, and its variation would be a more unusual  circumstance.
 I have chosen this example because the explanation which  most naturalists would advance is not here applicable, namely, that  specific characters are more variable than generic, because they are  taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly  used for classing genera.
 I believe this explanation is partly, yet only  indirectly, true; I shall, however, have to return to this point in  the chapter on Classification.
 It would be almost superfluous to adduce  evidence in support of the statement, that ordinary specific characters  are more variable than generic; but with respect to important  characters, I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that  when an author remarks with surprise that some important organ or part,  which is generally very constant throughout a large group of species,  DIFFERS considerably in closely-allied species, it is often VARIABLE  in the individuals of the same species.
 And this fact shows that a  character, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value  and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its  physiological importance may remain the same.
 Something of the same kind  applies to monstrosities: at least Is.
 Geoffroy St.
 Hilaire apparently  entertains no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in the  different species of the same group, the more subject it is to anomalies  in the individuals.
    On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,  why should that part of the structure, which differs from the same  part in other independently created species of the same genus, be  more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several  species? I do not see that any explanation can be given.
 But on the  view that species are only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might  expect often to find them still continuing to vary in those parts of  their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period, and  which have thus come to differ.
 Or to state the case in another manner:  the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and  in which they differ from allied genera, are called generic characters;  and these characters may be attributed to inheritance from a common  progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will  have modified several distinct species, fitted to more or less widely  different habits, in exactly the same manner: and as these so-called  generic characters have been inherited from before the period when the  several species first branched off from their common progenitor, and  subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in  a slight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present  day.
 On the other hand, the points in which species differ from other  species of the same genus are called specific characters; and as these  specific characters have varied and come to differ since the period when  the species branched off from a common progenitor, it is probable  that they should still often be in some degree variable--at least more  variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long  period remained constant.
    SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS VARIABLE.
    I think it will be admitted by naturalists, without my entering on  details, that secondary sexual characters are highly variable.
 It will  also be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other  more widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts  of their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference  between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual  characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between  the females.
 The cause of the original variability of these characters  is not manifest; but we can see why they should not have been rendered  as constant and uniform as others, for they are accumulated by sexual  selection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection,  as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the  less favoured males.
 Whatever the cause may be of the variability  of secondary sexual characters, as they are highly variable, sexual  selection will have had a wide scope for action, and may thus have  succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of  difference in these than in other respects.
    It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary differences between the two  sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same parts  of the organisation in which the species of the same genus differ from  each other.
 Of this fact I will give in illustration the first two  instances which happen to stand on my list; and as the differences in  these cases are of a very unusual nature, the relation can hardly be  accidental.
 The same number of joints in the tarsi is a character common  to very large groups of beetles, but in the Engidae, as Westwood has  remarked, the number varies greatly and the number likewise differs in  the two sexes of the same species.
 Again in the fossorial hymenoptera,  the neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance,  because common to large groups; but in certain genera the neuration  differs in the different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the  same species.
 Sir J.
 Lubbock has recently remarked, that several minute  crustaceans offer excellent illustrations of this law.
 "In Pontella,  for instance, the sexual characters are afforded mainly by the anterior  antennae and by the fifth pair of legs: the specific differences also  are principally given by these organs.
" This relation has a clear  meaning on my view: I look at all the species of the same genus as  having as certainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two  sexes of any one species.
 Consequently, whatever part of the structure  of the common progenitor, or of its early descendants, became variable;  variations of this part would, it is highly probable, be taken advantage  of by natural and sexual selection, in order to fit the several places  in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same  species to each other, or to fit the males to struggle with other males  for the possession of the females.
    Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific  characters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of  generic characters, or those which are possessed by all the species;  that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in  a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in  its congeners; and the slight degree of variability in a part, however  extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a whole group of  species; that the great variability of secondary sexual characters and  their great difference in closely allied species; that secondary sexual  and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the  same parts of the organisation, are all principles closely connected  together.
 All being mainly due to the species of the same group being  the descendants of a common progenitor, from whom they have inherited  much in common, to parts which have recently and largely varied being  more likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been  inherited and have not varied, to natural selection having more or less  completely, according to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency  to reversion and to further variability, to sexual selection being  less rigid than ordinary selection, and to variations in the same parts  having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection, and thus having  been adapted for secondary sexual, and for ordinary purposes.
    DISTINCT SPECIES PRESENT ANALOGOUS VARIATIONS, SO THAT A VARIETY OF  ONE SPECIES OFTEN ASSUMES A CHARACTER PROPER TO AN ALLIED SPECIES, OR  REVERTS TO SOME OF THE CHARACTERS OF AN EARLY PROGENITOR.
    These propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our  domestic races.
 The most distinct breeds of the pigeon, in countries  widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the  head, and with feathers on the feet, characters not possessed by the  aboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or  more distinct races.
 The frequent presence of fourteen or even  sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter may be considered as a variation  representing the normal structure of another race, the fantail.
 I  presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are  due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common  parent the same constitution and tendency to variation, when acted on by  similar unknown influences.
 In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of  analogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or as commonly called roots,  of the Swedish turnip and ruta-baga, plants which several botanists rank  as varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if this  be not so, the case will then be one of analogous variation in two  so-called distinct species; and to these a third may be added, namely,  the common turnip.
 According to the ordinary view of each species having  been independently created, we should have to attribute this similarity  in the enlarged stems of these three plants, not to the vera causa  of community of descent, and a consequent tendency to vary in a like  manner, but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation.
 Many  similar cases of analogous variation have been observed by Naudin in the  great gourd family, and by various authors in our cereals.
 Similar  cases occurring with insects under natural conditions have lately been  discussed with much ability by Mr. Walsh, who has grouped them under his  law of equable variability.
    With pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional  appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars  on the wings, white loins, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer  feathers externally edged near their bases with white.
 As all these  marks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no  one will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet  analogous variation appearing in the several breeds.
 We may, I think,  confidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these  coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring  of two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there  is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance  of the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the  mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.
    No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear  after having been lost for many, probably for hundreds of generations.
  But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the  offspring occasionally show for many generations a tendency to revert in  character to the foreign breed--some say, for a dozen or even a score of  generations.
 After twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a  common expression, from one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we  see, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained  by this remnant of foreign blood.
 In a breed which has not been  crossed, but in which BOTH parents have lost some character which their  progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce  the lost character might, as was formerly remarked, for all that we  can see to the contrary, be transmitted for almost any number of  generations.
 When a character which has been lost in a breed, reappears  after a great number of generations, the most probable hypothesis is,  not that one individual suddenly takes after an ancestor removed by  some hundred generations, but that in each successive generation the  character in question has been lying latent, and at last, under unknown  favourable conditions, is developed.
 With the barb-pigeon, for instance,  which very rarely produces a blue bird, it is probable that there is a  latent tendency in each generation to produce blue plumage.
 The abstract  improbability of such a tendency being transmitted through a vast number  of generations, is not greater than that of quite useless or rudimentary  organs being similarly transmitted.
 A mere tendency to produce a  rudiment is indeed sometimes thus inherited.
    As all the species of the same genus are supposed to be descended from  a common progenitor, it might be expected that they would occasionally  vary in an analogous manner; so that the varieties of two or more  species would resemble each other, or that a variety of one species  would resemble in certain characters another and distinct species,  this other species being, according to our view, only a well-marked and  permanent variety.
 But characters exclusively due to analogous variation  would probably be of an unimportant nature, for the preservation of  all functionally important characters will have been determined through  natural selection, in accordance with the different habits of the  species.
 It might further be expected that the species of the same  genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to long-lost characters.
  As, however, we do not know the common ancestor of any natural group,  we cannot distinguish between reversionary and analogous characters.
  If, for instance, we did not know that the parent rock-pigeon was not  feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether such  characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous  variations; but we might have inferred that the blue colour was a case  of reversion from the number of the markings, which are correlated with  this tint, and which would not probably have all appeared together from  simple variation.
 More especially we might have inferred this from the  blue colour and the several marks so often appearing when differently  coloured breeds are crossed.
 Hence, although under nature it must  generally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to formerly  existing characters, and what are new but analogous variations, yet  we ought, on our theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of a  species assuming characters which are already present in other members  of the same group.
 And this undoubtedly is the case.
    The difficulty in distinguishing variable species is largely due to  the varieties mocking, as it were, other species of the same genus.
  A considerable catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate  between two other forms, which themselves can only doubtfully be ranked  as species; and this shows, unless all these closely allied forms be  considered as independently created species, that they have in varying  assumed some of the characters of the others.
 But the best evidence of  analogous variations is afforded by parts or organs which are generally  constant in character, but which occasionally vary so as to resemble,  in some degree, the same part or organ in an allied species.
 I have  collected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, I lie under  the great disadvantage of not being able to give them.
 I can only repeat  that such cases certainly occur, and seem to me very remarkable.
    I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as  affecting any important character, but from occurring in several species  of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under nature.
  It is a case almost certainly of reversion.
 The ass sometimes has very  distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on the legs of a zebra.
  It has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal, and from  inquiries which I have made, I believe this to be true.
 The stripe on  the shoulder is sometimes double, and is very variable in length and  outline.
 A white ass, but NOT an albino, has been described without  either spinal or shoulder stripe; and these stripes are sometimes very  obscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses.
 The koulan  of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe.
  Mr. Blyth has seen a specimen of the hemionus with a distinct  shoulder-stripe, though it properly has none; and I have been informed  by Colonel Poole that foals of this species are generally striped on the  legs and faintly on the shoulder.
 The quagga, though so plainly barred  like a zebra over the body, is without bars on the legs; but Dr.
 Gray  has figured one specimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the  hocks.
    With respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the  spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of ALL colours;  transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one  instance in a chestnut; a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen  in duns, and I have seen a trace in a bay horse.
 My son made a careful  examination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double  stripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes.
 I have myself seen a dun  Devonshire pony, and a small dun Welsh pony has been carefully described  to me, both with THREE parallel stripes on each shoulder.
    In the northwest part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so  generally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined  this breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not  considered as purely bred.
 The spine is always striped; the legs are  generally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double  and sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is  sometimes striped.
 The stripes are often plainest in the foal; and  sometimes quite disappear in old horses.
 Colonel Poole has seen both  gray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled.
 I have also  reason to suspect, from information given me by Mr. W.
W.
 Edwards, that  with the English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the  foal than in the full-grown animal.
 I have myself recently bred a foal  from a bay mare (offspring of a Turkoman horse and a Flemish mare) by  a bay English race-horse.
 This foal, when a week old, was marked on its  hinder quarters and on its forehead with numerous very narrow, dark,  zebra-like bars, and its legs were feebly striped.
 All the stripes soon  disappeared completely.
 Without here entering on further details I may  state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses  of very different breeds in various countries from Britain to Eastern  China; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the  south.
 In all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest  in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is  included, from one between brown and black to a close approach to cream  colour.
    I am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this subject,  believes that the several breeds of the horse are descended from several  aboriginal species, one of which, the dun, was striped; and that the  above-described appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the dun  stock.
 But this view may be safely rejected, for it is highly improbable  that the heavy Belgian cart-horse, Welsh ponies, Norwegian cobs, the  lanky Kattywar race, etc.
, inhabiting the most distant parts of the  world, should have all have been crossed with one supposed aboriginal  stock.
    Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the  horse genus.
 Rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horse  is particularly apt to have bars on its legs; according to Mr. Gosse,  in certain parts of the United States, about nine out of ten mules have  striped legs.
 I once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any  one might have thought that it was a hybrid zebra; and Mr. W.
C.
 Martin,  in his excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar  mule.
 In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between  the ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest  of the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe.
 In  Lord Morton's famous hybrid, from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the  hybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the same  mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the  legs than is even the pure quagga.
 Lastly, and this is another most  remarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr.
 Gray (and he informs  me that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and  this hybrid, though the ass only occasionally has stripes on his  legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe,  nevertheless had all four legs barred, and had three short  shoulder-stripes, like those on the dun Devonshire and Welsh ponies, and  even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face.
 With respect  to this last fact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour  appears from what is commonly called chance, that I was led solely  from the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and  hemionus to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever occurred  in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and was, as we have  seen, answered in the affirmative.
    What now are we to say to these several facts? We see several distinct  species of the horse genus becoming, by simple variation, striped on the  legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an ass.
 In the horse  we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears--a tint which  approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the  genus.
 The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change  of form, or by any other new character.
 We see this tendency to become  striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the  most distinct species.
 Now observe the case of the several breeds  of pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon (including two or three  sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars  and other marks; and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish  tint, these bars and other marks invariably reappear; but without any  other change of form or character.
 When the oldest and truest breeds of  various colours are crossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue tint  and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels.
 I have stated that the  most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient  characters, is--that there is a TENDENCY in the young of each successive  generation to produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency,  from unknown causes, sometimes prevails.
 And we have just seen that in  several species of the horse genus the stripes are either plainer or  appear more commonly in the young than in the old.
 Call the breeds of  pigeons, some of which have bred true for centuries, species; and how  exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horse  genus! For myself, I venture confidently to look back thousands on  thousands of generations, and I see an animal striped like a zebra, but  perhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the common parent of  our domestic horse (whether or not it be descended from one or more wild  stocks) of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra.
    He who believes that each equine species was independently created,  will, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a  tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this  particular manner, so as often to become striped like the other species  of the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency,  when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to  produce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents, but  other species of the genus.
 To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to  reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown cause.
 It makes  the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon  believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had  never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now  living on the sea-shore.
    SUMMARY.
    Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound.
 Not in one case out  of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part  has varied.
 But whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison,  the same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences  between varieties of the same species, and the greater differences  between species of the same genus.
 Changed conditions generally induce  mere fluctuating variability, but sometimes they cause direct and  definite effects; and these may become strongly marked in the course  of time, though we have not sufficient evidence on this head.
 Habit in  producing constitutional peculiarities, and use in strengthening, and  disuse in weakening and diminishing organs, appear in many cases to have  been potent in their effects.
 Homologous parts tend to vary in the same  manner, and homologous parts tend to cohere.
 Modifications in hard parts  and in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts.
 When  one part is largely developed, perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from  the adjoining parts; and every part of the structure which can be saved  without detriment will be saved.
 Changes of structure at an early age  may affect parts subsequently developed; and many cases of correlated  variation, the nature of which we are unable to understand, undoubtedly  occur.
 Multiple parts are variable in number and in structure, perhaps  arising from such parts not having been closely specialised for any  particular function, so that their modifications have not been closely  checked by natural selection.
 It follows probably from this same cause,  that organic beings low in the scale are more variable than those  standing higher in the scale, and which have their whole organisation  more specialised.
 Rudimentary organs, from being useless, are not  regulated by natural selection, and hence are variable.
 Specific  characters--that is, the characters which have come to differ since the  several species of the same genus branched off from a common parent--are  more variable than generic characters, or those which have long been  inherited, and have not differed within this same period.
 In these  remarks we have referred to special parts or organs being still  variable, because they have recently varied and thus come to differ; but  we have also seen in the second chapter that the same principle applies  to the whole individual; for in a district where many species of a  genus are found--that is, where there has been much former variation and  differentiation, or where the manufactory of new specific forms has been  actively at work--in that district and among these species, we now find,  on an average, most varieties.
 Secondary sexual characters are highly  variable, and such characters differ much in the species of the same  group.
 Variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally  been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the  two sexes of the same species, and specific differences to the  several species of the same genus.
 Any part or organ developed to an  extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner, in comparison with  the same part or organ in the allied species, must have gone through an  extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose; and thus we  can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher  degree than other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow  process, and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had  time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to  reversion to a less modified state.
 But when a species with an  extraordinarily developed organ has become the parent of many modified  descendants--which on our view must be a very slow process, requiring a  long lapse of time--in this case, natural selection has succeeded in  giving a fixed character to the organ, in however extraordinary a manner  it may have been developed.
 Species inheriting nearly the same  constitution from a common parent, and exposed to similar influences,  naturally tend to present analogous variations, or these same species  may occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient  progenitors.
 Although new and important modifications may not arise from  reversion and analogous variation, such modifications will add to the  beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.
    Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference between the  offspring and their parents--and a cause for each must exist--we have  reason to believe that it is the steady accumulation of beneficial  differences which has given rise to all the more important modifications  of structure in relation to the habits of each species.
          .
 DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY.
     Difficulties of the theory of descent with modification--Absence   or rarity of transitional varieties--Transitions in habits of   life--Diversified habits in the same species--Species with habits   widely different from those of their allies--Organs of extreme   perfection--Modes of transition--Cases of difficulty--Natura non facit   saltum--Organs of small importance--Organs not in all cases absolutely   perfect--The law of Unity of Type and of the Conditions of Existence   embraced by the theory of Natural Selection.
      Long before the reader has arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of  difficulties will have occurred to him.
 Some of them are so serious that  to this day I can hardly reflect on them without being in some degree  staggered; but, to the best of my judgment, the greater number are only  apparent, and those that are real are not, I think, fatal to the theory.
    These difficulties and objections may be classed under the following  heads: First, why, if species have descended from other species by fine  gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why  is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see  them, well defined?    Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance,  the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the  modification of some other animal with widely different habits and  structure? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on  the one hand, an organ of trifling importance, such as the tail of a  giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, an organ  so wonderful as the eye?    Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural  selection? What shall we say to the instinct which leads the bee to make  cells, and which has practically anticipated the discoveries of profound  mathematicians?    Fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile  and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed,  their fertility is unimpaired?    The two first heads will be here discussed; some miscellaneous  objections in the following chapter; Instinct and Hybridism in the two  succeeding chapters.
    ON THE ABSENCE OR RARITY OF TRANSITIONAL VARIETIES.
    As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable  modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to  take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved  parent-form and other less-favoured forms with which it comes into  competition.
 Thus extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.
  Hence, if we look at each species as descended from some unknown form,  both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have  been exterminated by the very process of the formation and perfection of  the new form.
    But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed,  why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of  the earth? It will be more convenient to discuss this question in the  chapter on the imperfection of the geological record; and I will here  only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being  incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed.
 The crust of  the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been  imperfectly made, and only at long intervals of time.
    But it may be urged that when several closely allied species inhabit  the same territory, we surely ought to find at the present time many  transitional forms.
 Let us take a simple case: in travelling from north  to south over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals  with closely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly  the same place in the natural economy of the land.
 These representative  species often meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and  rarer, the other becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces  the other.
 But if we compare these species where they intermingle, they  are generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of  structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each.
  By my theory these allied species are descended from a common parent;  and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to  the conditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and  exterminated its original parent-form and all the transitional varieties  between its past and present states.
 Hence we ought not to expect at  the present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each  region, though they must have existed there, and may be embedded  there in a fossil condition.
 But in the intermediate region, having  intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find closely-linking  intermediate varieties? This difficulty for a long time quite confounded  me.
 But I think it can be in large part explained.
    In the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because  an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long  period.
 Geology would lead us to believe that most continents have been  broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods; and in  such islands distinct species might have been separately formed without  the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate  zones.
 By changes in the form of the land and of climate, marine areas  now continuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less  continuous and uniform condition than at present.
 But I will pass  over this way of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe that many  perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas;  though I do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas  now continuous, has played an important part in the formation of new  species, more especially with freely-crossing and wandering animals.
    In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area,  we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then  becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally  disappearing.
 Hence the neutral territory between two representative  species is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to  each.
 We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it  is quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph.
 De Candolle has observed, a  common alpine species disappears.
 The same fact has been noticed by E.
  Forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge.
 To those who  look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important  elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as  climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly.
 But when we  bear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis, would  increase immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing species;  that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others; in short,  that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the  most important manner to other organic beings--we see that the range  of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends  on insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on  the presence of other species, on which it lives, or by which it is  destroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these species  are already defined objects, not blending one into another by insensible  gradations, the range of any one species, depending as it does on the  range of others, will tend to be sharply defined.
 Moreover, each species  on the confines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will,  during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or in  the nature of the seasons, be extremely liable to utter extermination;  and thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply  defined.
    As allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area,  are generally distributed in such a manner that each has a wide range,  with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which  they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not  essentially differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to  both; and if we take a varying species inhabiting a very large area,  we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third  variety to a narrow intermediate zone.
 The intermediate variety,  consequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and  lesser area; and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds  good with varieties in a state of nature.
 I have met with striking  instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between  well-marked varieties in the genus Balanus.
 And it would appear from  information given me by Mr. Watson, Dr.
 Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston,  that generally, when varieties intermediate between two other forms  occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they  connect.
 Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and conclude  that varieties linking two other varieties together generally have  existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then we can  understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very  long periods: why, as a general rule, they should be exterminated and  disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.
    For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked,  run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large  numbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be  eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both  sides of it.
 But it is a far more important consideration, that during  the process of further modification, by which two varieties are supposed  to be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which  exist in larger numbers, from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great  advantage over the intermediate variety, which exists in smaller numbers  in a narrow and intermediate zone.
 For forms existing in larger numbers  will have a better chance, within any given period, of presenting  further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on, than  will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers.
 Hence, the more  common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the  less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved.
  It is the same principle which, as I believe, accounts for the common  species in each country, as shown in the second chapter, presenting on  an average a greater number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer  species.
 I may illustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of  sheep to be kept, one adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a  second to a comparatively narrow, hilly tract; and a third to the wide  plains at the base; and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal  steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection; the chances  in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the  mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the  small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly tract; and consequently  the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the  less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which originally  existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact with each  other, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate hill  variety.
    To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined  objects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of  varying and intermediate links: first, because new varieties are very  slowly formed, for variation is a slow process, and natural selection  can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations  occur, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can  be better filled by some modification of some one or more of its  inhabitants.
 And such new places will depend on slow changes of climate,  or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in  a still more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming  slowly modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones  acting and reacting on each other.
 So that, in any one region and at  any one time, we ought to see only a few species presenting slight  modifications of structure in some degree permanent; and this assuredly  we do see.
    Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent  period as isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially  among the classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have  separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative  species.
 In this case, intermediate varieties between the several  representative species and their common parent, must formerly have  existed within each isolated portion of the land, but these links  during the process of natural selection will have been supplanted and  exterminated, so that they will no longer be found in a living state.
    Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different  portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it  is probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but  they will generally have had a short duration.
 For these intermediate  varieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely from what we know  of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species,  and likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones  in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect.
 From  this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental  extermination; and during the process of further modification through  natural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted  by the forms which they connect; for these, from existing in greater  numbers will, in the aggregate, present more varieties, and thus be  further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages.
    Lastly, looking not to any one time, but at all time, if my theory be  true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all  the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed; but the  very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often  remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links.
  Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only  among fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall attempt to show  in a future chapter, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record.
    ON THE ORIGIN AND TRANSITION OF ORGANIC BEINGS WITH PECULIAR HABITS AND  STRUCTURE.
    It has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold, how, for  instance, could a land carnivorous animal have been converted into one  with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional  state have subsisted? It would be easy to show that there now exist  carnivorous animals presenting close intermediate grades from strictly  terrestrial to aquatic habits; and as each exists by a struggle for  life, it is clear that each must be well adapted to its place in nature.
  Look at the Mustela vison of North America, which has webbed feet,  and which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and form of tail;  during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish, but during the  long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys, like other polecats  on mice and land animals.
 If a different case had been taken, and it  had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been  converted into a flying bat, the question would have been far more  difficult to answer.
 Yet I think such difficulties have little weight.
    Here, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for, out  of the many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only  one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in allied  species; and of diversified habits, either constant or occasional, in  the same species.
 And it seems to me that nothing less than a long list  of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular  case like that of the bat.
    Look at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from  animals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as  Sir J.
 Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies  rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the  so-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and  even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which  serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to  an astonishing distance from tree to tree.
 We cannot doubt that each  structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by  enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more  quickly, or, as there is reason to believe, to lessen the danger  from occasional falls.
 But it does not follow from this fact that the  structure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive  under all possible conditions.
 Let the climate and vegetation change,  let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones  become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some,  at least, of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become  exterminated, unless they also become modified and improved in structure  in a corresponding manner.
 Therefore, I can see no difficulty,  more especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued  preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes,  each modification being useful, each being propagated, until, by the  accumulated effects of this process of natural selection, a perfect  so-called flying squirrel was produced.
    Now look at the Galeopithecus or so-called flying lemur, which was  formerly ranked among bats, but is now believed to belong to the  Insectivora.
 An extremely wide flank-membrane stretches from the corners  of the jaw to the tail, and includes the limbs with the elongated  fingers.
 This flank-membrane is furnished with an extensor muscle.
  Although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding through the  air, now connect the Galeopithecus with the other Insectivora, yet there  is no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed, and that  each was developed in the same manner as with the less perfectly gliding  squirrels; each grade of structure having been useful to its possessor.
  Nor can I see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it  possible that the membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the  Galeopithecus might have been greatly lengthened by natural selection;  and this, as far as the organs of flight are concerned, would  have converted the animal into a bat.
 In certain bats in which the  wing-membrane extends from the top of the shoulder to the tail and  includes the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus originally  fitted for gliding through the air rather than for flight.
    If about a dozen genera of birds were to become extinct, who would have  ventured to surmise that birds might have existed which used their wings  solely as flappers, like the logger headed duck (Micropterus of Eyton);  as fins in the water and as front legs on the land, like the penguin;  as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no purpose, like the  apteryx? Yet the structure of each of these birds is good for it, under  the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for each has to live by a  struggle: but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible  conditions.
 It must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the  grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all be the  result of disuse, indicate the steps by which birds actually acquired  their perfect power of flight; but they serve to show what diversified  means of transition are at least possible.
    Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the  Crustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land; and seeing that  we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified  types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that  flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising and  turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been modified  into perfectly winged animals.
 If this had been effected, who would  have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been  inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs of  flight exclusively, so far as we know, to escape being devoured by other  fish?    When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit,  as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals  displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom have  survived to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by their  successors, which were gradually rendered more perfect through natural  selection.
 Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional states between  structures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have  been developed at an early period in great numbers and under many  subordinate forms.
 Thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of  the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true  flight would have been developed under many subordinate forms, for  taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land and in the water,  until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection,  so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in  the battle for life.
 Hence the chance of discovering species with  transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be  less, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case of  species with fully developed structures.
    I will now give two or three instances, both of diversified and of  changed habits, in the individuals of the same species.
 In either case  it would be easy for natural selection to adapt the structure of the  animal to its changed habits, or exclusively to one of its several  habits.
 It is, however, difficult to decide and immaterial for us,  whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards; or  whether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits; both  probably often occurring almost simultaneously.
 Of cases of changed  habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many British  insects which now feed on exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial  substances.
 Of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given:  I have often watched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in  South America, hovering over one spot and then proceeding to another,  like a kestrel, and at other times standing stationary on the margin of  water, and then dashing into it like a kingfisher at a fish.
 In our own  country the larger titmouse (Parus major) may be seen climbing branches,  almost like a creeper; it sometimes, like a shrike, kills small birds by  blows on the head; and I have many times seen and heard it hammering the  seeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them like a nuthatch.
 In  North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with  widely open mouth, thus catching, almost like a whale, insects in the  water.
    As we sometimes see individuals following habits different from those  proper to their species and to the other species of the same genus, we  might expect that such individuals would occasionally give rise to  new species, having anomalous habits, and with their structure either  slightly or considerably modified from that of their type.
 And such  instances occur in nature.
 Can a more striking instance of adaptation be  given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and seizing insects  in the chinks of the bark? Yet in North America there are woodpeckers  which feed largely on fruit, and others with elongated wings which chase  insects on the wing.
 On the plains of La Plata, where hardly a tree  grows, there is a woodpecker (Colaptes campestris) which has two toes  before and two behind, a long-pointed tongue, pointed tail-feathers,  sufficiently stiff to support the bird in a vertical position on a post,  but not so stiff as in the typical wood-peckers, and a straight, strong  beak.
 The beak, however, is not so straight or so strong as in the  typical woodpeckers but it is strong enough to bore into wood.
 Hence  this Colaptes, in all the essential parts of its structure, is a  woodpecker.
 Even in such trifling characters as the colouring, the harsh  tone of the voice, and undulatory flight, its close blood-relationship  to our common woodpecker is plainly declared; yet, as I can assert, not  only from my own observations, but from those of the accurate Azara, in  certain large districts it does not climb trees, and it makes its  nest in holes in banks! In certain other districts, however, this same  woodpecker, as Mr. Hudson states, frequents trees, and bores holes in  the trunk for its nest.
 I may mention as another illustration of the  varied habits of this genus, that a Mexican Colaptes has been described  by De Saussure as boring holes into hard wood in order to lay up a store  of acorns.
    Petrels are the most aerial and oceanic of birds, but, in the quiet  sounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its general  habits, in its astonishing power of diving, in its manner of swimming  and of flying when made to take flight, would be mistaken by any one for  an auk or a grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but with  many parts of its organisation profoundly modified in relation to its  new habits of life; whereas the woodpecker of La Plata has had its  structure only slightly modified.
 In the case of the water-ouzel, the  acutest observer, by examining its dead body, would never have suspected  its sub-aquatic habits; yet this bird, which is allied to the thrush  family, subsists by diving,--using its wings under water and  grasping stones with its feet.
 All the members of the great order of  Hymenopterous insects are terrestrial, excepting the genus Proctotrupes,  which Sir John Lubbock has discovered to be aquatic in its habits; it  often enters the water and dives about by the use not of its legs but of  its wings, and remains as long as four hours beneath the surface; yet  it exhibits no modification in structure in accordance with its abnormal  habits.
    He who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must  occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having  habits and structure not in agreement.
 What can be plainer than that the  webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? Yet there are  upland geese with webbed feet which rarely go near the water; and no one  except Audubon, has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four toes  webbed, alight on the surface of the ocean.
 On the other hand, grebes  and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered  by membrane.
 What seems plainer than that the long toes, not furnished  with membrane, of the Grallatores, are formed for walking over swamps  and floating plants.
 The water-hen and landrail are members of this  order, yet the first is nearly as aquatic as the coot, and the second is  nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge.
 In such cases, and  many others could be given, habits have changed without a corresponding  change of structure.
 The webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to  have become almost rudimentary in function, though not in structure.
  In the frigate-bird, the deeply scooped membrane between the toes shows  that structure has begun to change.
    He who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation may say,  that in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one  type to take the place of one belonging to another type; but this seems  to me only restating the fact in dignified language.
 He who believes in  the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection,  will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to  increase in numbers; and that if any one being varies ever so little,  either in habits or structure, and thus gains an advantage over some  other inhabitant of the same country, it will seize on the place of that  inhabitant, however different that may be from its own place.
 Hence it  will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds  with webbed feet, living on the dry land and rarely alighting on the  water, that there should be long-toed corncrakes, living in meadows  instead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers where hardly a  tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes and diving Hymenoptera,  and petrels with the habits of auks.
    ORGANS OF EXTREME PERFECTION AND COMPLICATION.
    To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for  adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different  amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic  aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely  confess, absurd in the highest degree.
 When it was first said that the  sun stood still and the world turned round, the common sense of mankind  declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of Vox populi, vox Dei,  as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in science.
 Reason tells  me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one  complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to  its possessor, as is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies  and the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case;  and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing  conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and  complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by  our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.
  How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than  how life itself originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest  organisms in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving  light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements  in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves,  endowed with this special sensibility.
    In searching for the gradations through which an organ in any species  has been perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal  progenitors; but this is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced  to look to other species and genera of the same group, that is to the  collateral descendants from the same parent-form, in order to see what  gradations are possible, and for the chance of some gradations having  been transmitted in an unaltered or little altered condition.
 But the  state of the same organ in distinct classes may incidentally throw light  on the steps by which it has been perfected.
    The simplest organ which can be called an eye consists of an optic  nerve, surrounded by pigment-cells and covered by translucent skin, but  without any lens or other refractive body.
 We may, however, according  to M.
 Jourdain, descend even a step lower and find aggregates of  pigment-cells, apparently serving as organs of vision, without any  nerves, and resting merely on sarcodic tissue.
 Eyes of the above simple  nature are not capable of distinct vision, and serve only to distinguish  light from darkness.
 In certain star-fishes, small depressions in the  layer of pigment which surrounds the nerve are filled, as described by  the author just quoted, with transparent gelatinous matter, projecting  with a convex surface, like the cornea in the higher animals.
 He  suggests that this serves not to form an image, but only to concentrate  the luminous rays and render their perception more easy.
 In this  concentration of the rays we gain the first and by far the most  important step towards the formation of a true, picture-forming eye; for  we have only to place the naked extremity of the optic nerve, which in  some of the lower animals lies deeply buried in the body, and in  some near the surface, at the right distance from the concentrating  apparatus, and an image will be formed on it.
    In the great class of the Articulata, we may start from an optic nerve  simply coated with pigment, the latter sometimes forming a sort of  pupil, but destitute of lens or other optical contrivance.
 With insects  it is now known that the numerous facets on the cornea of their great  compound eyes form true lenses, and that the cones include curiously  modified nervous filaments.
 But these organs in the Articulata are so  much diversified that Muller formerly made three main classes with seven  subdivisions, besides a fourth main class of aggregated simple eyes.
    When we reflect on these facts, here given much too briefly, with  respect to the wide, diversified, and graduated range of structure in  the eyes of the lower animals; and when we bear in mind how small the  number of all living forms must be in comparison with those which have  become extinct, the difficulty ceases to be very great in believing that  natural selection may have converted the simple apparatus of an optic  nerve, coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane, into  an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the  Articulata class.
    He who will go thus far, ought not to hesitate to go one step further,  if he finds on finishing this volume that large bodies of facts,  otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of modification  through natural selection; he ought to admit that a structure even as  perfect as an eagle's eye might thus be formed, although in this case  he does not know the transitional states.
 It has been objected that in  order to modify the eye and still preserve it as a perfect instrument,  many changes would have to be effected simultaneously, which, it is  assumed, could not be done through natural selection; but as I have  attempted to show in my work on the variation of domestic animals, it is  not necessary to suppose that the modifications were all simultaneous,  if they were extremely slight and gradual.
 Different kinds of  modification would, also, serve for the same general purpose: as Mr.  Wallace has remarked, "If a lens has too short or too long a focus, it  may be amended either by an alteration of curvature, or an alteration of  density; if the curvature be irregular, and the rays do not converge  to a point, then any increased regularity of curvature will be an  improvement.
 So the contraction of the iris and the muscular  movements of the eye are neither of them essential to vision, but only  improvements which might have been added and perfected at any stage of  the construction of the instrument.
" Within the highest division of  the animal kingdom, namely, the Vertebrata, we can start from an eye  so simple, that it consists, as in the lancelet, of a little sack of  transparent skin, furnished with a nerve and lined with pigment, but  destitute of any other apparatus.
 In fishes and reptiles, as Owen has  remarked, "The range of gradation of dioptric structures is very  great.
" It is a significant fact that even in man, according to the high  authority of Virchow, the beautiful crystalline lens is formed in the  embryo by an accumulation of epidermic cells, lying in a sack-like fold  of the skin; and the vitreous body is formed from embryonic subcutaneous  tissue.
 To arrive, however, at a just conclusion regarding the  formation of the eye, with all its marvellous yet not absolutely perfect  characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the  imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far to keenly to be  surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural  selection to so startling a length.
    It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye with a telescope.
  We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued  efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the  eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process.
 But may not this  inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator  works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the  eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick  layer of transparent tissue, with spaces filled with fluid, and with a  nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this  layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate  into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different  distances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly  changing in form.
 Further we must suppose that there is a power,  represented by natural selection or the survival of the fittest, always  intently watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers; and  carefully preserving each which, under varied circumstances, in any way  or degree, tends to produce a distincter image.
 We must suppose each  new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; each to be  preserved until a better is produced, and then the old ones to be all  destroyed.
 In living bodies, variation will cause the slight alteration,  generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection  will pick out with unerring skill each improvement.
 Let this process  go on for millions of years; and during each year on millions of  individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical  instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the  works of the Creator are to those of man?    MODES Of TRANSITION.
    If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which  could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight  modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.
 But I can find  out no such case.
 No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know  the transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated  species, around which, according to the theory, there has been much  extinction.
 Or again, if we take an organ common to all the members of  a class, for in this latter case the organ must have been originally  formed at a remote period, since which all the many members of the class  have been developed; and in order to discover the early transitional  grades through which the organ has passed, we should have to look to  very ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct.
    We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not  have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind.
 Numerous cases  could be given among the lower animals of the same organ performing  at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus in the larva of the  dragon-fly and in the fish Cobites the alimentary canal respires,  digests, and excretes.
 In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside  out, and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire.
  In such cases natural selection might specialise, if any advantage  were thus gained, the whole or part of an organ, which had previously  performed two functions, for one function alone, and thus by insensible  steps greatly change its nature.
 Many plants are known which regularly  produce at the same time differently constructed flowers; and if such  plants were to produce one kind alone, a great change would be effected  with comparative suddenness in the character of the species.
 It is,  however, probable that the two sorts of flowers borne by the same plant  were originally differentiated by finely graduated steps, which may  still be followed in some few cases.
    Again, two distinct organs, or the same organ under two very different  forms, may simultaneously perform in the same individual the same  function, and this is an extremely important means of transition: to  give one instance--there are fish with gills or branchiae that breathe  the air dissolved in the water, at the same time that they breathe free  air in their swim-bladders, this latter organ being divided by highly  vascular partitions and having a ductus pneumaticus for the supply of  air.
 To give another instance from the vegetable kingdom: plants climb  by three distinct means, by spirally twining, by clasping a support with  their sensitive tendrils, and by the emission of aerial rootlets; these  three means are usually found in distinct groups, but some few species  exhibit two of the means, or even all three, combined in the same  individual.
 In all such cases one of the two organs might readily be  modified and perfected so as to perform all the work, being aided during  the progress of modification by the other organ; and then this other  organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be  wholly obliterated.
    The illustration of the swim-bladder in fishes is a good one, because  it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally  constructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into  one for a widely different purpose, namely respiration.
 The swim-bladder  has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs  of certain fishes.
 All physiologists admit that the swim-bladder is  homologous, or "ideally similar" in position and structure with the  lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to  doubt that the swim-bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or  an organ used exclusively for respiration.
    According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals  with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient  and unknown prototype which was furnished with a floating apparatus or  swim-bladder.
 We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen's interesting  description of these parts, understand the strange fact that every  particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the  orifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs,  notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis  is closed.
 In the higher Vertebrata the branchiae have wholly  disappeared--but in the embryo the slits on the sides of the neck and  the loop-like course of the arteries still mark their former position.
  But it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiae might have  been gradually worked in by natural selection for some distinct purpose:  for instance, Landois has shown that the wings of insects are developed  from the trachea; it is therefore highly probable that in this great  class organs which once served for respiration have been actually  converted into organs for flight.
    In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind  the probability of conversion from one function to another, that I will  give another instance.
 Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of  skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the means  of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched within  the sack.
 These cirripedes have no branchiae, the whole surface of  the body and of the sack, together with the small frena, serving for  respiration.
 The Balanidae or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand,  have no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack,  within the well-enclosed shell; but they have, in the same relative  position with the frena, large, much-folded membranes, which freely  communicate with the circulatory lacunae of the sack and body, and which  have been considered by all naturalists to act as branchiae.
 Now I  think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are  strictly homologous with the branchiae of the other family; indeed, they  graduate into each other.
 Therefore it need not be doubted that the two  little folds of skin, which originally served as ovigerous frena, but  which, likewise, very slightly aided in the act of respiration, have  been gradually converted by natural selection into branchiae, simply  through an increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive  glands.
 If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct, and they have  suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would  ever have imagined that the branchiae in this latter family had  originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed  out of the sack?    There is another possible mode of transition, namely, through the  acceleration or retardation of the period of reproduction.
 This has  lately been insisted on by Professor Cope and others in the United  States.
 It is now known that some animals are capable of reproduction  at a very early age, before they have acquired their perfect characters;  and if this power became thoroughly well developed in a species, it  seems probable that the adult stage of development would sooner or later  be lost; and in this case, especially if the larva differed much from  the mature form, the character of the species would be greatly changed  and degraded.
 Again, not a few animals, after arriving at maturity, go  on changing in character during nearly their whole lives.
 With mammals,  for instance, the form of the skull is often much altered with age, of  which Dr.
 Murie has given some striking instances with seals.
 Every  one knows how the horns of stags become more and more branched, and the  plumes of some birds become more finely developed, as they grow older.
  Professor Cope states that the teeth of certain lizards change much in  shape with advancing years.
 With crustaceans not only many trivial,  but some important parts assume a new character, as recorded by Fritz  Muller, after maturity.
 In all such cases--and many could be given--if  the age for reproduction were retarded, the character of the species, at  least in its adult state, would be modified; nor is it improbable that  the previous and earlier stages of development would in some cases be  hurried through and finally lost.
 Whether species have often or ever  been modified through this comparatively sudden mode of transition, I  can form no opinion; but if this has occurred, it is probable that the  differences between the young and the mature, and between the mature and  the old, were primordially acquired by graduated steps.
    SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.
    Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ  could not have been produced by successive, small, transitional  gradations, yet undoubtedly serious cases of difficulty occur.
    One of the most serious is that of neuter insects, which are often  differently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but  this case will be treated of in the next chapter.
 The electric organs of  fishes offer another case of special difficulty; for it is impossible  to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced.
 But  this is not surprising, for we do not even know of what use they are.
  In the gymnotus and torpedo they no doubt serve as powerful means of  defence, and perhaps for securing prey; yet in the ray, as observed  by Matteucci, an analogous organ in the tail manifests but little  electricity, even when the animal is greatly irritated; so little that  it can hardly be of any use for the above purposes.
 Moreover, in the  ray, besides the organ just referred to, there is, as Dr.
 R.
 McDonnell  has shown, another organ near the head, not known to be electrical, but  which appears to be the real homologue of the electric battery in the  torpedo.
 It is generally admitted that there exists between these organs  and ordinary muscle a close analogy, in intimate structure, in the  distribution of the nerves, and in the manner in which they are acted  on by various reagents.
 It should, also, be especially observed that  muscular contraction is accompanied by an electrical discharge; and,  as Dr.
 Radcliffe insists, "in the electrical apparatus of the torpedo  during rest, there would seem to be a charge in every respect like that  which is met with in muscle and nerve during the rest, and the discharge  of the torpedo, instead of being peculiar, may be only another form of  the discharge which attends upon the action of muscle and motor nerve.
"  Beyond this we cannot at present go in the way of explanation; but as  we know so little about the uses of these organs, and as we know nothing  about the habits and structure of the progenitors of the existing  electric fishes, it would be extremely bold to maintain that no  serviceable transitions are possible by which these organs might have  been gradually developed.
    These organs appear at first to offer another and far more serious  difficulty; for they occur in about a dozen kinds of fish, of which  several are widely remote in their affinities.
 When the same organ is  found in several members of the same class, especially if in members  having very different habits of life, we may generally attribute its  presence to inheritance from a common ancestor; and its absence in some  of the members to loss through disuse or natural selection.
 So that, if  the electric organs had been inherited from some one ancient progenitor,  we might have expected that all electric fishes would have been  specially related to each other; but this is far from the case.
 Nor does  geology at all lead to the belief that most fishes formerly possessed  electric organs, which their modified descendants have now lost.
 But  when we look at the subject more closely, we find in the several fishes  provided with electric organs, that these are situated in different  parts of the body, that they differ in construction, as in the  arrangement of the plates, and, according to Pacini, in the process or  means by which the electricity is excited--and lastly, in being supplied  with nerves proceeding from different sources, and this is perhaps  the most important of all the differences.
 Hence in the several  fishes furnished with electric organs, these cannot be considered as  homologous, but only as analogous in function.
 Consequently there is  no reason to suppose that they have been inherited from a common  progenitor; for had this been the case they would have closely resembled  each other in all respects.
 Thus the difficulty of an organ, apparently  the same, arising in several remotely allied species, disappears,  leaving only the lesser yet still great difficulty: namely, by what  graduated steps these organs have been developed in each separate group  of fishes.
    The luminous organs which occur in a few insects, belonging to widely  different families, and which are situated in different parts of the  body, offer, under our present state of ignorance, a difficulty almost  exactly parallel with that of the electric organs.
 Other similar cases  could be given; for instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of  a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with an adhesive gland,  is apparently the same in Orchis and Asclepias, genera almost as remote  as is possible among flowering plants; but here again the parts are not  homologous.
 In all cases of beings, far removed from each other in the  scale of organisation, which are furnished with similar and peculiar  organs, it will be found that although the general appearance and  function of the organs may be the same, yet fundamental differences  between them can always be detected.
 For instance, the eyes of  Cephalopods or cuttle-fish and of vertebrate animals appear wonderfully  alike; and in such widely sundered groups no part of this resemblance  can be due to inheritance from a common progenitor.
 Mr. Mivart has  advanced this case as one of special difficulty, but I am unable to  see the force of his argument.
 An organ for vision must be formed of  transparent tissue, and must include some sort of lens for throwing  an image at the back of a darkened chamber.
 Beyond this superficial  resemblance, there is hardly any real similarity between the eyes of  cuttle-fish and vertebrates, as may be seen by consulting Hensen's  admirable memoir on these organs in the Cephalopoda.
 It is impossible  for me here to enter on details, but I may specify a few of the points  of difference.
 The crystalline lens in the higher cuttle-fish consists  of two parts, placed one behind the other like two lenses, both having  a very different structure and disposition to what occurs in the  vertebrata.
 The retina is wholly different, with an actual inversion of  the elemental parts, and with a large nervous ganglion included within  the membranes of the eye.
 The relations of the muscles are as different  as it is possible to conceive, and so in other points.
 Hence it is not  a little difficult to decide how far even the same terms ought to be  employed in describing the eyes of the Cephalopoda and Vertebrata.
 It  is, of course, open to any one to deny that the eye in either case could  have been developed through the natural selection of successive slight  variations; but if this be admitted in the one case it is clearly  possible in the other; and fundamental differences of structure in the  visual organs of two groups might have been anticipated, in accordance  with this view of their manner of formation.
 As two men have sometimes  independently hit on the same invention, so in the several foregoing  cases it appears that natural selection, working for the good of each  being, and taking advantage of all favourable variations, has produced  similar organs, as far as function is concerned, in distinct organic  beings, which owe none of their structure in common to inheritance from  a common progenitor.
    Fritz Muller, in order to test the conclusions arrived at in this  volume, has followed out with much care a nearly similar line of  argument.
 Several families of crustaceans include a few species,  possessing an air-breathing apparatus and fitted to live out of the  water.
 In two of these families, which were more especially examined by  Muller, and which are nearly related to each other, the species agree  most closely in all important characters: namely in their sense organs,  circulating systems, in the position of the tufts of hair within  their complex stomachs, and lastly in the whole structure of the  water-breathing branchiae, even to the microscopical hooks by which they  are cleansed.
 Hence it might have been expected that in the few species  belonging to both families which live on the land, the equally important  air-breathing apparatus would have been the same; for why should this  one apparatus, given for the same purpose, have been made to differ,  while all the other important organs were closely similar, or rather,  identical.
    Fritz Muller argues that this close similarity in so many points  of structure must, in accordance with the views advanced by me, be  accounted for by inheritance from a common progenitor.
 But as the vast  majority of the species in the above two families, as well as most  other crustaceans, are aquatic in their habits, it is improbable in the  highest degree that their common progenitor should have been adapted for  breathing air.
 Muller was thus led carefully to examine the apparatus in  the air-breathing species; and he found it to differ in each in several  important points, as in the position of the orifices, in the manner in  which they are opened and closed, and in some accessory details.
 Now  such differences are intelligible, and might even have been expected, on  the supposition that species belonging to distinct families had slowly  become adapted to live more and more out of water, and to breathe the  air.
 For these species, from belonging to distinct families, would have  differed to a certain extent, and in accordance with the principle that  the nature of each variation depends on two factors, viz.
, the nature of  the organism and that of the surrounding conditions, their variability  assuredly would not have been exactly the same.
 Consequently natural  selection would have had different materials or variations to work on,  in order to arrive at the same functional result; and the structures  thus acquired would almost necessarily have differed.
 On the hypothesis  of separate acts of creation the whole case remains unintelligible.
 This  line of argument seems to have had great weight in leading Fritz Muller  to accept the views maintained by me in this volume.
    Another distinguished zoologist, the late Professor Claparede, has  argued in the same manner, and has arrived at the same result.
 He  shows that there are parasitic mites (Acaridae), belonging to distinct  sub-families and families, which are furnished with hair-claspers.
 These  organs must have been independently developed, as they could not have  been inherited from a common progenitor; and in the several groups they  are formed by the modification of the fore legs, of the hind legs, of  the maxillae or lips, and of appendages on the under side of the hind  part of the body.
    In the foregoing cases, we see the same end gained and the same function  performed, in beings not at all or only remotely allied, by organs in  appearance, though not in development, closely similar.
 On the other  hand, it is a common rule throughout nature that the same end should  be gained, even sometimes in the case of closely related beings, by the  most diversified means.
 How differently constructed is the feathered  wing of a bird and the membrane-covered wing of a bat; and still more so  the four wings of a butterfly, the two wings of a fly, and the two wings  with the elytra of a beetle.
 Bivalve shells are made to open and shut,  but on what a number of patterns is the hinge constructed, from the long  row of neatly interlocking teeth in a Nucula to the simple ligament of  a Mussel! Seeds are disseminated by their minuteness, by their capsule  being converted into a light balloon-like envelope, by being embedded  in pulp or flesh, formed of the most diverse parts, and rendered  nutritious, as well as conspicuously coloured, so as to attract and  be devoured by birds, by having hooks and grapnels of many kinds and  serrated awns, so as to adhere to the fur of quadrupeds, and by being  furnished with wings and plumes, as different in shape as they are  elegant in structure, so as to be wafted by every breeze.
 I will give  one other instance: for this subject of the same end being gained by the  most diversified means well deserves attention.
 Some authors maintain  that organic beings have been formed in many ways for the sake of  mere variety, almost like toys in a shop, but such a view of nature is  incredible.
 With plants having separated sexes, and with those in which,  though hermaphrodites, the pollen does not spontaneously fall on the  stigma, some aid is necessary for their fertilisation.
 With several  kinds this is effected by the pollen-grains, which are light and  incoherent, being blown by the wind through mere chance on to the  stigma; and this is the simplest plan which can well be conceived.
 An  almost equally simple, though very different plan occurs in many plants  in which a symmetrical flower secretes a few drops of nectar, and is  consequently visited by insects; and these carry the pollen from the  anthers to the stigma.
    From this simple stage we may pass through an inexhaustible number of  contrivances, all for the same purpose and effected in essentially the  same manner, but entailing changes in every part of the flower.
 The  nectar may be stored in variously shaped receptacles, with the  stamens and pistils modified in many ways, sometimes forming trap-like  contrivances, and sometimes capable of neatly adapted movements through  irritability or elasticity.
 From such structures we may advance till we  come to such a case of extraordinary adaptation as that lately described  by Dr.
 Cruger in the Coryanthes.
 This orchid has part of its labellum or  lower lip hollowed out into a great bucket, into which drops of almost  pure water continually fall from two secreting horns which stand above  it; and when the bucket is half-full, the water overflows by a spout on  one side.
 The basal part of the labellum stands over the bucket, and is  itself hollowed out into a sort of chamber with two lateral entrances;  within this chamber there are curious fleshy ridges.
 The most ingenious  man, if he had not witnessed what takes place, could never have imagined  what purpose all these parts serve.
 But Dr.
 Cruger saw crowds of large  humble-bees visiting the gigantic flowers of this orchid, not in order  to suck nectar, but to gnaw off the ridges within the chamber above the  bucket; in doing this they frequently pushed each other into the bucket,  and their wings being thus wetted they could not fly away, but were  compelled to crawl out through the passage formed by the spout or  overflow.
 Dr.
 Cruger saw a "continual procession" of bees thus crawling  out of their involuntary bath.
 The passage is narrow, and is roofed over  by the column, so that a bee, in forcing its way out, first rubs its  back against the viscid stigma and then against the viscid glands of the  pollen-masses.
 The pollen-masses are thus glued to the back of the  bee which first happens to crawl out through the passage of a lately  expanded flower, and are thus carried away.
 Dr.
 Cruger sent me a flower  in spirits of wine, with a bee which he had killed before it had quite  crawled out, with a pollen-mass still fastened to its back.
 When the  bee, thus provided, flies to another flower, or to the same flower a  second time, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket and then  crawls out by the passage, the pollen-mass necessarily comes first into  contact with the viscid stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower is  fertilised.
 Now at last we see the full use of every part of the flower,  of the water-secreting horns of the bucket half-full of water, which  prevents the bees from flying away, and forces them to crawl out through  the spout, and rub against the properly placed viscid pollen-masses and  the viscid stigma.
    The construction of the flower in another closely allied orchid, namely,  the Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same end; and is  equally curious.
 Bees visit these flowers, like those of the Coryanthes,  in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch  a long, tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have called it, the  antenna.
 This antenna, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration  to a certain membrane which is instantly ruptured; this sets free a  spring by which the pollen-mass is shot forth, like an arrow, in the  right direction, and adheres by its viscid extremity to the back of the  bee.
 The pollen-mass of the male plant (for the sexes are separate in  this orchid) is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it  is brought into contact with the stigma, which is viscid enough to  break certain elastic threads, and retain the pollen, thus effecting  fertilisation.
    How, it may be asked, in the foregoing and in innumerable other  instances, can we understand the graduated scale of complexity and the  multifarious means for gaining the same end.
 The answer no doubt is, as  already remarked, that when two forms vary, which already differ from  each other in some slight degree, the variability will not be of the  same exact nature, and consequently the results obtained through natural  selection for the same general purpose will not be the same.
 We should  also bear in mind that every highly developed organism has passed  through many changes; and that each modified structure tends to be  inherited, so that each modification will not readily be quite lost,  but may be again and again further altered.
 Hence, the structure of each  part of each species, for whatever purpose it may serve, is the sum of  many inherited changes, through which the species has passed during its  successive adaptations to changed habits and conditions of life.
    Finally, then, although in many cases it is most difficult even to  conjecture by what transitions organs could have arrived at their  present state; yet, considering how small the proportion of living and  known forms is to the extinct and unknown, I have been astonished how  rarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is  known to lead.
 It is certainly true, that new organs appearing as if  created for some special purpose rarely or never appear in any being; as  indeed is shown by that old, but somewhat exaggerated, canon in natural  history of "Natura non facit saltum.
" We meet with this admission in the  writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards  has well expressed it, "Nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in  innovation.
" Why, on the theory of Creation, should there be so much  variety and so little real novelty? Why should all the parts and organs  of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately  created for its own proper place in nature, be so commonly linked  together by graduated steps? Why should not Nature take a sudden leap  from structure to structure? On the theory of natural selection, we can  clearly understand why she should not; for natural selection acts only  by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can never take  a great and sudden leap, but must advance by the short and sure, though  slow steps.
    ORGANS OF LITTLE APPARENT IMPORTANCE, AS AFFECTED BY NATURAL SELECTION.
    As natural selection acts by life and death, by the survival of the  fittest, and by the destruction of the less well-fitted individuals,  I have sometimes felt great difficulty in understanding the origin or  formation of parts of little importance; almost as great, though of  a very different kind, as in the case of the most perfect and complex  organs.
    In the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole  economy of any one organic being to say what slight modifications would  be of importance or not.
 In a former  have given instances of  very trifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of  its flesh, the colour of the skin and hair of quadrupeds, which, from  being correlated with constitutional differences, or from determining  the attacks of insects, might assuredly be acted on by natural  selection.
 The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially  constructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this  could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight  modifications, each better and better fitted, for so trifling an object  as to drive away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive  even in this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of  cattle and other animals in South America absolutely depend on their  power of resisting the attacks of insects: so that individuals which  could by any means defend themselves from these small enemies, would be  able to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage.
 It is  not that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some  rare cases) by flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their  strength reduced, so that they are more subject to disease, or not so  well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from  beasts of prey.
    Organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of  high importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly  perfected at a former period, have been transmitted to existing species  in nearly the same state, although now of very slight use; but any  actually injurious deviations in their structure would of course have  been checked by natural selection.
 Seeing how important an organ of  locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence and  use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or  modified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus  accounted for.
 A well-developed tail having been formed in an aquatic  animal, it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of  purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an aid in  turning, as in the case of the dog, though the aid in this latter  respect must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double  still more quickly.
    In the second place, we may easily err in attributing importance to  characters, and in believing that they have been developed through  natural selection.
 We must by no means overlook the effects of the  definite action of changed conditions of life, of so-called spontaneous  variations, which seem to depend in a quite subordinate degree on the  nature of the conditions, of the tendency to reversion to long-lost  characters, of the complex laws of growth, such as of correlation,  comprehension, of the pressure of one part on another, etc.
, and finally  of sexual selection, by which characters of use to one sex are often  gained and then transmitted more or less perfectly to the other sex,  though of no use to the sex.
 But structures thus indirectly gained,  although at first of no advantage to a species, may subsequently  have been taken advantage of by its modified descendants, under new  conditions of life and newly acquired habits.
    If green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there  were many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought  that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to conceal this  tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was  a character of importance, and had been acquired through natural  selection; as it is, the colour is probably in chief part due to sexual  selection.
 A trailing palm in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest  trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the  ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest  service to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees  which are not climbers, and which, as there is reason to believe from  the distribution of the thorn-bearing species in Africa and South  America, serve as a defence against browsing quadrupeds, so the spikes  on the palm may at first have been developed for this object, and  subsequently have been improved and taken advantage of by the plant, as  it underwent further modification and became a climber.
 The naked skin  on the head of a vulture is generally considered as a direct adaptation  for wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due  to the direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in  drawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the  clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked.
 The sutures in the skulls  of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding  parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable  for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and  reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that  this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken  advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.
    We are profoundly ignorant of the cause of each slight variation or  individual difference; and we are immediately made conscious of this  by reflecting on the differences between the breeds of our domesticated  animals in different countries, more especially in the less civilized  countries, where there has been but little methodical selection.
 Animals  kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for  their own subsistence, and are exposed to a certain extent to natural  selection, and individuals with slightly different constitutions would  succeed best under different climates.
 With cattle susceptibility to the  attacks of flies is correlated with colour, as is the liability to be  poisoned by certain plants; so that even colour would be thus subjected  to the action of natural selection.
 Some observers are convinced that a  damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with the hair the  horns are correlated.
 Mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds;  and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from  exercising them more, and possibly even the form of the pelvis; and then  by the law of homologous variation, the front limbs and the head would  probably be affected.
 The shape, also, of the pelvis might affect  by pressure the shape of certain parts of the young in the womb.
 The  laborious breathing necessary in high regions tends, as we have  good reason to believe, to increase the size of the chest; and again  correlation would come into play.
 The effects of lessened exercise,  together with abundant food, on the whole organisation is probably still  more important, and this, as H.
 von Nathusius has lately shown in  his excellent Treatise, is apparently one chief cause of the great  modification which the breeds of swine have undergone.
 But we are far  too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several  known and unknown causes of variation; and I have made these remarks  only to show that, if we are unable to account for the characteristic  differences of our several domestic breeds, which nevertheless are  generally admitted to have arisen through ordinary generation from  one or a few parent-stocks, we ought not to lay too much stress on  our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogous differences  between true species.
    UTILITARIAN DOCTRINE, HOW FAR TRUE: BEAUTY, HOW ACQUIRED.
    The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately  made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every  detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor.
  They believe that many structures have been created for the sake of  beauty, to delight man or the Creator (but this latter point is beyond  the scope of scientific discussion), or for the sake of mere variety,  a view already discussed.
 Such doctrines, if true, would be absolutely  fatal to my theory.
 I fully admit that many structures are now of no  direct use to their possessors, and may never have been of any use to  their progenitors; but this does not prove that they were formed  solely for beauty or variety.
 No doubt the definite action of changed  conditions, and the various causes of modifications, lately specified,  have all produced an effect, probably a great effect, independently of  any advantage thus gained.
 But a still more important consideration is  that the chief part of the organisation of every living creature is due  to inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well  fitted for its place in nature, many structures have now no very close  and direct relation to present habits of life.
 Thus, we can  hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose, or of the  frigate-bird, are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe  that the similar bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the  horse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of  special use to these animals.
 We may safely attribute these structures  to inheritance.
 But webbed feet no doubt were as useful to the  progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, as they now  are to the most aquatic of living birds.
 So we may believe that the  progenitor of the seal did not possess a flipper, but a foot with five  toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further venture to  believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse and  bat, were originally developed, on the principle of utility, probably  through the reduction of more numerous bones in the fin of some ancient  fish-like progenitor of the whole class.
 It is scarcely possible to  decide how much allowance ought to be made for such causes of change,  as the definite action of external conditions, so-called spontaneous  variations, and the complex laws of growth; but with these important  exceptions, we may conclude that the structure of every living creature  either now is, or was formerly, of some direct or indirect use to its  possessor.
    With respect to the belief that organic beings have been created  beautiful for the delight of man--a belief which it has been pronounced  is subversive of my whole theory--I may first remark that the sense of  beauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind, irrespective of  any real quality in the admired object; and that the idea of what is  beautiful, is not innate or unalterable.
 We see this, for instance, in  the men of different races admiring an entirely different standard of  beauty in their women.
 If beautiful objects had been created solely for  man's gratification, it ought to be shown that before man appeared  there was less beauty on the face of the earth than since he came on the  stage.
 Were the beautiful volute and cone shells of the Eocene epoch,  and the gracefully sculptured ammonites of the Secondary period, created  that man might ages afterwards admire them in his cabinet? Few objects  are more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of the diatomaceae:  were these created that they might be examined and admired under the  higher powers of the microscope? The beauty in this latter case, and  in many others, is apparently wholly due to symmetry of growth.
 Flowers  rank among the most beautiful productions of nature; but they have  been rendered conspicuous in contrast with the green leaves, and in  consequence at the same time beautiful, so that they may be easily  observed by insects.
 I have come to this conclusion from finding it an  invariable rule that when a flower is fertilised by the wind it never  has a gaily-coloured corolla.
 Several plants habitually produce two  kinds of flowers; one kind open and coloured so as to attract insects;  the other closed, not coloured, destitute of nectar, and never visited  by insects.
 Hence, we may conclude that, if insects had not been  developed on the face of the earth, our plants would not have been  decked with beautiful flowers, but would have produced only such poor  flowers as we see on our fir, oak, nut and ash trees, on grasses,  spinach, docks and nettles, which are all fertilised through the agency  of the wind.
 A similar line of argument holds good with fruits; that  a ripe strawberry or cherry is as pleasing to the eye as to the  palate--that the gaily-coloured fruit of the spindle-wood tree and the  scarlet berries of the holly are beautiful objects--will be admitted by  everyone.
 But this beauty serves merely as a guide to birds and  beasts, in order that the fruit may be devoured and the matured seeds  disseminated.
 I infer that this is the case from having as yet found  no exception to the rule that seeds are always thus disseminated when  embedded within a fruit of any kind (that is within a fleshy or  pulpy envelope), if it be coloured of any brilliant tint, or rendered  conspicuous by being white or black.
    On the other hand, I willingly admit that a great number of male  animals, as all our most gorgeous birds, some fishes, reptiles, and  mammals, and a host of magnificently coloured butterflies, have been  rendered beautiful for beauty's sake.
 But this has been effected through  sexual selection, that is, by the more beautiful males having been  continually preferred by the females, and not for the delight of man.
 So  it is with the music of birds.
 We may infer from all this that a nearly  similar taste for beautiful colours and for musical sounds runs through  a large part of the animal kingdom.
 When the female is as beautifully  coloured as the male, which is not rarely the case with birds and  butterflies, the cause apparently lies in the colours acquired through  sexual selection having been transmitted to both sexes, instead of to  the males alone.
 How the sense of beauty in its simplest form--that is,  the reception of a peculiar kind of pleasure from certain colours, forms  and sounds--was first developed in the mind of man and of the lower  animals, is a very obscure subject.
 The same sort of difficulty is  presented if we enquire how it is that certain flavours and odours give  pleasure, and others displeasure.
 Habit in all these cases appears  to have come to a certain extent into play; but there must be some  fundamental cause in the constitution of the nervous system in each  species.
    Natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in a species  exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout  nature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by the  structures of others.
 But natural selection can and does often produce  structures for the direct injury of other animals, as we see in the fang  of the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs  are deposited in the living bodies of other insects.
 If it could be  proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been  formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my  theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.
  Although many statements may be found in works on natural history to  this effect, I cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight.
 It  is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence  and for the destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at  the same time it is furnished with a rattle for its own injury, namely,  to warn its prey.
 I would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the  end of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to warn the doomed  mouse.
 It is a much more probable view that the rattlesnake uses its  rattle, the cobra expands its frill and the puff-adder swells while  hissing so loudly and harshly, in order to alarm the many birds and  beasts which are known to attack even the most venomous species.
 Snakes  act on the same principle which makes the hen ruffle her feathers and  expand her wings when a dog approaches her chickens.
 But I have not  space here to enlarge on the many ways by which animals endeavour to  frighten away their enemies.
    Natural selection will never produce in a being any structure more  injurious than beneficial to that being, for natural selection acts  solely by and for the good of each.
 No organ will be formed, as Paley  has remarked, for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury  to its possessor.
 If a fair balance be struck between the good and evil  caused by each part, each will be found on the whole advantageous.
 After  the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes  to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will  become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.
    Natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as,  or slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same country  with which it comes into competition.
 And we see that this is the  standard of perfection attained under nature.
 The endemic productions of  New Zealand, for instance, are perfect, one compared with another; but  they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants  and animals introduced from Europe.
 Natural selection will not produce  absolute perfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can judge, with  this high standard under nature.
 The correction for the aberration of  light is said by Muller not to be perfect even in that most perfect  organ, the human eye.
 Helmholtz, whose judgment no one will dispute,  after describing in the strongest terms the wonderful powers of the  human eye, adds these remarkable words: "That which we have discovered  in the way of inexactness and imperfection in the optical machine and  in the image on the retina, is as nothing in comparison with the  incongruities which we have just come across in the domain of the  sensations.
 One might say that nature has taken delight in accumulating  contradictions in order to remove all foundation from the theory of a  pre-existing harmony between the external and internal worlds.
" If our  reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable  contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may easily  err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect.
 Can we  consider the sting of the bee as perfect, which, when used against many  kinds of enemies, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures,  and thus inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its  viscera?    If we look at the sting of the bee, as having existed in a remote  progenitor, as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many  members of the same great order, and that it has since been modified  but not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally  adapted for some other object, such as to produce galls, since  intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the  sting should so often cause the insect's own death: for if on the whole  the power of stinging be useful to the social community, it will fulfil  all the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the death  of some few members.
 If we admire the truly wonderful power of scent by  which the males of many insects find their females, can we admire the  production for this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are  utterly useless to the community for any other purpose, and which are  ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? It may  be difficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred  of the queen-bee, which urges her to destroy the young queens, her  daughters, as soon as they are born, or to perish herself in the combat;  for undoubtedly this is for the good of the community; and maternal love  or maternal hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all  the same to the inexorable principles of natural selection.
 If we admire  the several ingenious contrivances by which orchids and many other  plants are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as equally  perfect the elaboration of dense clouds of pollen by our fir-trees, so  that a few granules may be wafted by chance on to the ovules?    SUMMARY: THE LAW OF UNITY OF TYPE AND OF THE CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE  EMBRACED BY THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.
    We have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and  objections which may be urged against the theory.
 Many of them are  serious; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on  several facts, which on the belief of independent acts of creation are  utterly obscure.
 We have seen that species at any one period are not  indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of  intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection  is always very slow, and at any one time acts only on a few forms;  and partly because the very process of natural selection implies the  continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate  gradations.
 Closely allied species, now living on a continuous area,  must often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and when  the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to  another.
 When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous  area, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an  intermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety  will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which it  connects; consequently the two latter, during the course of further  modification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a great  advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will thus  generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it.
    We have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding  that the most different habits of life could not graduate into each  other; that a bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural  selection from an animal which at first only glided through the air.
    We have seen that a species under new conditions of life may change its  habits, or it may have diversified habits, with some very unlike those  of its nearest congeners.
 Hence we can understand, bearing in mind that  each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has  arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers,  diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.
    Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been  formed by natural selection, is enough to stagger any one; yet in  the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in  complexity, each good for its possessor, then under changing conditions  of life, there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any  conceivable degree of perfection through natural selection.
 In the cases  in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should  be extremely cautious in concluding that none can have existed, for the  metamorphoses of many organs show what wonderful changes in function  are at least possible.
 For instance, a swim-bladder has apparently been  converted into an air-breathing lung.
 The same organ having performed  simultaneously very different functions, and then having been in part  or in whole specialised for one function; and two distinct organs  having performed at the same time the same function, the one having been  perfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated  transitions.
    We have seen that in two beings widely remote from each other in the  natural scale, organs serving for the same purpose and in external  appearance closely similar may have been separately and independently  formed; but when such organs are closely examined, essential differences  in their structure can almost always be detected; and this naturally  follows from the principle of natural selection.
 On the other hand, the  common rule throughout nature is infinite diversity of structure for  gaining the same end; and this again naturally follows from the same  great principle.
    In many cases we are far too ignorant to be enabled to assert that  a part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that  modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated  by means of natural selection.
 In many other cases, modifications  are probably the direct result of the laws of variation or of growth,  independently of any good having been thus gained.
 But even such  structures have often, as we may feel assured, been subsequently taken  advantage of, and still further modified, for the good of species under  new conditions of life.
 We may, also, believe that a part formerly of  high importance has frequently been retained (as the tail of an aquatic  animal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such  small importance that it could not, in its present state, have been  acquired by means of natural selection.
    Natural selection can produce nothing in one species for the exclusive  good or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs, and  excretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious  to another species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the  possessor.
 In each well-stocked country natural selection acts through  the competition of the inhabitants and consequently leads to success  in the battle for life, only in accordance with the standard of that  particular country.
 Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the  smaller one, often yield to the inhabitants of another and generally the  larger country.
 For in the larger country there will have existed more  individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will  have been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been  rendered higher.
 Natural selection will not necessarily lead to absolute  perfection; nor, as far as we can judge by our limited faculties, can  absolute perfection be everywhere predicated.
    On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full  meaning of that old canon in natural history, "Natura non facit saltum.
"  This canon, if we look to the present inhabitants alone of the world, is  not strictly correct; but if we include all those of past times, whether  known or unknown, it must on this theory be strictly true.
    It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on  two great laws--Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence.
 By unity  of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see  in organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of  their habits of life.
 On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity  of descent.
 The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted  on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of  natural selection.
 For natural selection acts by either now adapting the  varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions  of life; or by having adapted them during past periods of time: the  adaptations being aided in many cases by the increased use or disuse  of parts, being affected by the direct action of external conditions  of life, and subjected in all cases to the several laws of growth and  variation.
 Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the  higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former variations  and adaptations, that of Unity of Type.

 MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.
     Longevity--Modifications not necessarily simultaneous--Modifications   apparently of no direct service--Progressive development--Characters of   small functional importance, the most constant--Supposed incompetence   of natural selection to account for the incipient stages of useful   structures--Causes which interfere with the acquisition through natural   selection of useful structures--Gradations of structure with changed   functions--Widely different organs in members of the same class,   developed from one and the same source--Reasons for disbelieving in   great and abrupt modifications.
      I will devote this chapter to the consideration of various miscellaneous  objections which have been advanced against my views, as some of the  previous discussions may thus be made clearer; but it would be useless  to discuss all of them, as many have been made by writers who have not  taken the trouble to understand the subject.
 Thus a distinguished German  naturalist has asserted that the weakest part of my theory is, that I  consider all organic beings as imperfect: what I have really said is,  that all are not as perfect as they might have been in relation to their  conditions; and this is shown to be the case by so many native forms  in many quarters of the world having yielded their places to intruding  foreigners.
 Nor can organic beings, even if they were at any one time  perfectly adapted to their conditions of life, have remained so, when  their conditions changed, unless they themselves likewise changed; and  no one will dispute that the physical conditions of each country, as  well as the number and kinds of its inhabitants, have undergone many  mutations.
    A critic has lately insisted, with some parade of mathematical accuracy,  that longevity is a great advantage to all species, so that he who  believes in natural selection "must arrange his genealogical tree" in  such a manner that all the descendants have longer lives than their  progenitors! Cannot our critics conceive that a biennial plant or one of  the lower animals might range into a cold climate and perish there every  winter; and yet, owing to advantages gained through natural selection,  survive from year to year by means of its seeds or ova? Mr. E.
 Ray  Lankester has recently discussed this subject, and he concludes, as far  as its extreme complexity allows him to form a judgment, that longevity  is generally related to the standard of each species in the scale of  organisation, as well as to the amount of expenditure in reproduction  and in general activity.
 And these conditions have, it is probable, been  largely determined through natural selection.
    It has been argued that, as none of the animals and plants of Egypt,  of which we know anything, have changed during the last three or four  thousand years, so probably have none in any part of the world.
 But, as  Mr. G.
H.
 Lewes has remarked, this line of argument proves too much,  for the ancient domestic races figured on the Egyptian monuments, or  embalmed, are closely similar or even identical with those now living;  yet all naturalists admit that such races have been produced through  the modification of their original types.
 The many animals which have  remained unchanged since the commencement of the glacial period, would  have been an incomparably stronger case, for these have been exposed  to great changes of climate and have migrated over great distances;  whereas, in Egypt, during the last several thousand years, the  conditions of life, as far as we know, have remained absolutely uniform.
  The fact of little or no modification having been effected since the  glacial period, would have been of some avail against those who believe  in an innate and necessary law of development, but is powerless against  the doctrine of natural selection or the survival of the fittest, which  implies that when variations or individual differences of a beneficial  nature happen to arise, these will be preserved; but this will be  effected only under certain favourable circumstances.
    The celebrated palaeontologist, Bronn, at the close of his German  translation of this work, asks how, on the principle of natural  selection, can a variety live side by side with the parent species?  If both have become fitted for slightly different habits of life  or conditions, they might live together; and if we lay on one side  polymorphic species, in which the variability seems to be of a peculiar  nature, and all mere temporary variations, such as size, albinism,  etc.
, the more permanent varieties are generally found, as far as I can  discover, inhabiting distinct stations, such as high land or low land,  dry or moist districts.
 Moreover, in the case of animals which wander  much about and cross freely, their varieties seem to be generally  confined to distinct regions.
    Bronn also insists that distinct species never differ from each other in  single characters, but in many parts; and he asks, how it always comes  that many parts of the organisation should have been modified at the  same time through variation and natural selection? But there is no  necessity for supposing that all the parts of any being have been  simultaneously modified.
 The most striking modifications, excellently  adapted for some purpose, might, as was formerly remarked, be acquired  by successive variations, if slight, first in one part and then in  another; and as they would be transmitted all together, they would  appear to us as if they had been simultaneously developed.
 The best  answer, however, to the above objection is afforded by those domestic  races which have been modified, chiefly through man's power of  selection, for some special purpose.
 Look at the race and dray-horse, or  at the greyhound and mastiff.
 Their whole frames, and even their mental  characteristics, have been modified; but if we could trace each step  in the history of their transformation--and the latter steps can be  traced--we should not see great and simultaneous changes, but first  one part and then another slightly modified and improved.
 Even when  selection has been applied by man to some one character alone--of which  our cultivated plants offer the best instances--it will invariably be  found that although this one part, whether it be the flower, fruit, or  leaves, has been greatly changed, almost all the other parts have been  slightly modified.
 This may be attributed partly to the principle of  correlated growth, and partly to so-called spontaneous variation.
    A much more serious objection has been urged by Bronn, and recently by  Broca, namely, that many characters appear to be of no service whatever  to their possessors, and therefore cannot have been influenced through  natural selection.
 Bronn adduces the length of the ears and tails in the  different species of hares and mice--the complex folds of enamel in the  teeth of many animals, and a multitude of analogous cases.
 With respect  to plants, this subject has been discussed by Nageli in an admirable  essay.
 He admits that natural selection has effected much, but he  insists that the families of plants differ chiefly from each other in  morphological characters, which appear to be quite unimportant for the  welfare of the species.
 He consequently believes in an innate tendency  towards progressive and more perfect development.
 He specifies the  arrangement of the cells in the tissues, and of the leaves on the axis,  as cases in which natural selection could not have acted.
 To these  may be added the numerical divisions in the parts of the flower, the  position of the ovules, the shape of the seed, when not of any use for  dissemination, etc.
    There is much force in the above objection.
 Nevertheless, we ought, in  the first place, to be extremely cautious in pretending to decide what  structures now are, or have formerly been, of use to each species.
 In  the second place, it should always be borne in mind that when one part  is modified, so will be other parts, through certain dimly seen causes,  such as an increased or diminished flow of nutriment to a part, mutual  pressure, an early developed part affecting one subsequently developed,  and so forth--as well as through other causes which lead to the  many mysterious cases of correlation, which we do not in the least  understand.
 These agencies may be all grouped together, for the sake of  brevity, under the expression of the laws of growth.
 In the third  place, we have to allow for the direct and definite action of changed  conditions of life, and for so-called spontaneous variations, in which  the nature of the conditions apparently plays a quite subordinate part.
  Bud-variations, such as the appearance of a moss-rose on a common rose,  or of a nectarine on a peach-tree, offer good instances of spontaneous  variations; but even in these cases, if we bear in mind the power of a  minute drop of poison in producing complex galls, we ought not to feel  too sure that the above variations are not the effect of some local  change in the nature of the sap, due to some change in the conditions.
  There must be some efficient cause for each slight individual  difference, as well as for more strongly marked variations which  occasionally arise; and if the unknown cause were to act persistently,  it is almost certain that all the individuals of the species would be  similarly modified.
    In the earlier editions of this work I underrated, as it now seems  probable, the frequency and importance of modifications due to  spontaneous variability.
 But it is impossible to attribute to this cause  the innumerable structures which are so well adapted to the habits  of life of each species.
 I can no more believe in this than that  the well-adapted form of a race-horse or greyhound, which before the  principle of selection by man was well understood, excited so much  surprise in the minds of the older naturalists, can thus be explained.
    It may be worth while to illustrate some of the foregoing remarks.
 With  respect to the assumed inutility of various parts and organs, it is  hardly necessary to observe that even in the higher and best-known  animals many structures exist, which are so highly developed that no one  doubts that they are of importance, yet their use has not been, or has  only recently been, ascertained.
 As Bronn gives the length of the ears  and tail in the several species of mice as instances, though trifling  ones, of differences in structure which can be of no special use, I may  mention that, according to Dr.
 Schobl, the external ears of the common  mouse are supplied in an extraordinary manner with nerves, so that  they no doubt serve as tactile organs; hence the length of the ears can  hardly be quite unimportant.
 We shall, also, presently see that the tail  is a highly useful prehensile organ to some of the species; and its use  would be much influence by its length.
    With respect to plants, to which on account of Nageli's essay I shall  confine myself in the following remarks, it will be admitted that the  flowers of the orchids present a multitude of curious structures,  which a few years ago would have been considered as mere morphological  differences without any special function; but they are now known to be  of the highest importance for the fertilisation of the species through  the aid of insects, and have probably been gained through natural  selection.
 No one until lately would have imagined that in dimorphic and  trimorphic plants the different lengths of the stamens and pistils, and  their arrangement, could have been of any service, but now we know this  to be the case.
    In certain whole groups of plants the ovules stand erect, and in others  they are suspended; and within the same ovarium of some few plants, one  ovule holds the former and a second ovule the latter position.
 These  positions seem at first purely morphological, or of no physiological  signification; but Dr.
 Hooker informs me that within the same ovarium  the upper ovules alone in some cases, and in others the lower ones  alone are fertilised; and he suggests that this probably depends on  the direction in which the pollen-tubes enter the ovarium.
 If so, the  position of the ovules, even when one is erect and the other suspended  within the same ovarium, would follow the selection of any slight  deviations in position which favoured their fertilisation, and the  production of seed.
    Several plants belonging to distinct orders habitually produce flowers  of two kinds--the one open, of the ordinary structure, the other closed  and imperfect.
 These two kinds of flowers sometimes differ wonderfully  in structure, yet may be seen to graduate into each other on the same  plant.
 The ordinary and open flowers can be intercrossed; and the  benefits which certainly are derived from this process are thus secured.
  The closed and imperfect flowers are, however, manifestly of high  importance, as they yield with the utmost safety a large stock of seed,  with the expenditure of wonderfully little pollen.
 The two kinds of  flowers often differ much, as just stated, in structure.
 The petals in  the imperfect flowers almost always consist of mere rudiments, and the  pollen-grains are reduced in diameter.
 In Ononis columnae five of the  alternate stamens are rudimentary; and in some species of Viola three  stamens are in this state, two retaining their proper function, but  being of very small size.
 In six out of thirty of the closed flowers in  an Indian violet (name unknown, for the plants have never produced with  me perfect flowers), the sepals are reduced from the normal number of  five to three.
 In one section of the Malpighiaceae the closed flowers,  according to A.
 de Jussieu, are still further modified, for the five  stamens which stand opposite to the sepals are all aborted, a sixth  stamen standing opposite to a petal being alone developed; and this  stamen is not present in the ordinary flowers of this species; the style  is aborted; and the ovaria are reduced from three to two.
 Now although  natural selection may well have had the power to prevent some of  the flowers from expanding, and to reduce the amount of pollen, when  rendered by the closure of the flowers superfluous, yet hardly any of  the above special modifications can have been thus determined, but  must have followed from the laws of growth, including the functional  inactivity of parts, during the progress of the reduction of the pollen  and the closure of the flowers.
    It is so necessary to appreciate the important effects of the laws of  growth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind, namely  of differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in relative  position on the same plant.
 In the Spanish chestnut, and in certain  fir-trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ, according to  Schacht, in the nearly horizontal and in the upright branches.
 In the  common rue and some other plants, one flower, usually the central or  terminal one, opens first, and has five sepals and petals, and five  divisions to the ovarium; while all the other flowers on the plant are  tetramerous.
 In the British Adoxa the uppermost flower generally has  two calyx-lobes with the other organs tetramerous, while the surrounding  flowers generally have three calyx-lobes with the other organs  pentamerous.
 In many Compositae and Umbelliferae (and in some other  plants) the circumferential flowers have their corollas much more  developed than those of the centre; and this seems often connected with  the abortion of the reproductive organs.
 It is a more curious fact,  previously referred to, that the achenes or seeds of the circumference  and centre sometimes differ greatly in form, colour and other  characters.
 In Carthamus and some other Compositae the central achenes  alone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head yields  achenes of three different forms.
 In certain Umbelliferae the exterior  seeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one  coelospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De  Candolle to be in other species of the highest systematic importance.
  Professor Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the flowers in  the lower part of the spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets; and  in the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved and two-seeded  siliques.
 In these several cases, with the exception of that of the  well-developed ray-florets, which are of service in making the flowers  conspicuous to insects, natural selection cannot, as far as we can  judge, have come into play, or only in a quite subordinate manner.
 All  these modifications follow from the relative position and inter-action  of the parts; and it can hardly be doubted that if all the flowers and  leaves on the same plant had been subjected to the same external and  internal condition, as are the flowers and leaves in certain positions,  all would have been modified in the same manner.
    In numerous other cases we find modifications of structure, which are  considered by botanists to be generally of a highly important nature,  affecting only some of the flowers on the same plant, or occurring on  distinct plants, which grow close together under the same conditions.
 As  these variations seem of no special use to the plants, they cannot  have been influenced by natural selection.
 Of their cause we are quite  ignorant; we cannot even attribute them, as in the last class of cases,  to any proximate agency, such as relative position.
 I will give only  a few instances.
 It is so common to observe on the same plant, flowers  indifferently tetramerous, pentamerous, etc.
, that I need not give  examples; but as numerical variations are comparatively rare when the  parts are few, I may mention that, according to De Candolle, the flowers  of Papaver bracteatum offer either two sepals with four petals (which  is the common type with poppies), or three sepals with six petals.
 The  manner in which the petals are folded in the bud is in most groups a  very constant morphological character; but Professor Asa Gray states  that with some species of Mimulus, the aestivation is almost as  frequently that of the Rhinanthideae as of the Antirrhinideae, to which  latter tribe the genus belongs.
 Aug.
 St.
 Hilaire gives the following  cases: the genus Zanthoxylon belongs to a division of the Rutaceae with  a single ovary, but in some species flowers may be found on the same  plant, and even in the same panicle, with either one or two ovaries.
  In Helianthemum the capsule has been described as unilocular or  tri-locular; and in H.
 mutabile, "Une lame PLUS OU MOINS LARGE,  s'etend entre le pericarpe et le placenta.
" In the flowers of Saponaria  officinalis Dr.
 Masters has observed instances of both marginal and free  central placentation.
 Lastly, St.
 Hilaire found towards the southern  extreme of the range of Gomphia oleaeformis two forms which he did  not at first doubt were distinct species, but he subsequently saw them  growing on the same bush; and he then adds, "Voila donc dans un meme  individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent tantot a un axe  verticale et tantot a un gynobase.
"    We thus see that with plants many morphological changes may be  attributed to the laws of growth and the inter-action of parts,  independently of natural selection.
 But with respect to Nageli's  doctrine of an innate tendency towards perfection or progressive  development, can it be said in the case of these strongly pronounced  variations, that the plants have been caught in the act of progressing  towards a higher state of development? On the contrary, I should infer  from the mere fact of the parts in question differing or varying greatly  on the same plant, that such modifications were of extremely small  importance to the plants themselves, of whatever importance they may  generally be to us for our classifications.
 The acquisition of a useless  part can hardly be said to raise an organism in the natural scale; and  in the case of the imperfect, closed flowers, above described, if any  new principle has to be invoked, it must be one of retrogression rather  than of progression; and so it must be with many parasitic and degraded  animals.
 We are ignorant of the exciting cause of the above specified  modifications; but if the unknown cause were to act almost uniformly for  a length of time, we may infer that the result would be almost uniform;  and in this case all the individuals of the species would be modified in  the same manner.
    From the fact of the above characters being unimportant for the welfare  of the species, any slight variations which occurred in them would  not have been accumulated and augmented through natural selection.
 A  structure which has been developed through long-continued selection,  when it ceases to be of service to a species, generally becomes  variable, as we see with rudimentary organs; for it will no longer be  regulated by this same power of selection.
 But when, from the nature  of the organism and of the conditions, modifications have been induced  which are unimportant for the welfare of the species, they may be, and  apparently often have been, transmitted in nearly the same state to  numerous, otherwise modified, descendants.
 It cannot have been of much  importance to the greater number of mammals, birds, or reptiles, whether  they were clothed with hair, feathers or scales; yet hair has been  transmitted to almost all mammals, feathers to all birds, and scales to  all true reptiles.
 A structure, whatever it may be, which is common to  many allied forms, is ranked by us as of high systematic importance,  and consequently is often assumed to be of high vital importance to the  species.
 Thus, as I am inclined to believe, morphological differences,  which we consider as important--such as the arrangement of the leaves,  the divisions of the flower or of the ovarium, the position of the  ovules, etc.
, first appeared in many cases as fluctuating variations,  which sooner or later became constant through the nature of the organism  and of the surrounding conditions, as well as through the intercrossing  of distinct individuals, but not through natural selection; for as these  morphological characters do not affect the welfare of the species, any  slight deviations in them could not have been governed or accumulated  through this latter agency.
 It is a strange result which we thus arrive  at, namely, that characters of slight vital importance to the species,  are the most important to the systematist; but, as we shall hereafter  see when we treat of the genetic principle of classification, this is by  no means so paradoxical as it may at first appear.
    Although we have no good evidence of the existence in organic beings of  an innate tendency towards progressive development, yet this necessarily  follows, as I have attempted to show in the fourth chapter, through the  continued action of natural selection.
 For the best definition which  has ever been given of a high standard of organisation, is the degree  to which the parts have been specialised or differentiated; and natural  selection tends towards this end, inasmuch as the parts are thus enabled  to perform their functions more efficiently.
    A distinguished zoologist, Mr. St.
 George Mivart, has recently collected  all the objections which have ever been advanced by myself and others  against the theory of natural selection, as propounded by Mr. Wallace  and myself, and has illustrated them with admirable art and force.
 When  thus marshalled, they make a formidable array; and as it forms no  part of Mr. Mivart's plan to give the various facts and considerations  opposed to his conclusions, no slight effort of reason and memory is  left to the reader, who may wish to weigh the evidence on both sides.
  When discussing special cases, Mr. Mivart passes over the effects of the  increased use and disuse of parts, which I have always maintained to be  highly important, and have treated in my "Variation under Domestication"  at greater length than, as I believe, any other writer.
 He likewise  often assumes that I attribute nothing to variation, independently of  natural selection, whereas in the work just referred to I have collected  a greater number of well-established cases than can be found in any  other work known to me.
 My judgment may not be trustworthy, but after  reading with care Mr. Mivart's book, and comparing each section with  what I have said on the same head, I never before felt so strongly  convinced of the general truth of the conclusions here arrived at,  subject, of course, in so intricate a subject, to much partial error.
    All Mr. Mivart's objections will be, or have been, considered in the  present volume.
 The one new point which appears to have struck many  readers is, "That natural selection is incompetent to account for the  incipient stages of useful structures.
" This subject is intimately  connected with that of the gradation of the characters, often  accompanied by a change of function, for instance, the conversion of a  swim-bladder into lungs, points which were discussed in the last chapter  under two headings.
 Nevertheless, I will here consider in some detail  several of the cases advanced by Mr. Mivart, selecting those which are  the most illustrative, as want of space prevents me from considering  all.
    The giraffe, by its lofty stature, much elongated neck, fore legs, head  and tongue, has its whole frame beautifully adapted for browsing on the  higher branches of trees.
 It can thus obtain food beyond the reach of  the other Ungulata or hoofed animals inhabiting the same country; and  this must be a great advantage to it during dearths.
 The Niata cattle  in South America show us how small a difference in structure may make,  during such periods, a great difference in preserving an animal's  life.
 These cattle can browse as well as others on grass, but from the  projection of the lower jaw they cannot, during the often recurrent  droughts, browse on the twigs of trees, reeds, etc.
, to which food the  common cattle and horses are then driven; so that at these times the  Niatas perish, if not fed by their owners.
 Before coming to Mr. Mivart's  objections, it may be well to explain once again how natural selection  will act in all ordinary cases.
 Man has modified some of his animals,  without necessarily having attended to special points of structure, by  simply preserving and breeding from the fleetest individuals, as with  the race-horse and greyhound, or as with the game-cock, by breeding  from the victorious birds.
 So under nature with the nascent giraffe, the  individuals which were the highest browsers and were able during dearths  to reach even an inch or two above the others, will often have been  preserved; for they will have roamed over the whole country in search of  food.
 That the individuals of the same species often differ slightly  in the relative lengths of all their parts may be seen in many works of  natural history, in which careful measurements are given.
 These slight  proportional differences, due to the laws of growth and variation, are  not of the slightest use or importance to most species.
 But it will have  been otherwise with the nascent giraffe, considering its probable habits  of life; for those individuals which had some one part or several parts  of their bodies rather more elongated than usual, would generally  have survived.
 These will have intercrossed and left offspring, either  inheriting the same bodily peculiarities, or with a tendency to vary  again in the same manner; while the individuals less favoured in the  same respects will have been the most liable to perish.
    We here see that there is no need to separate single pairs, as man does,  when he methodically improves a breed: natural selection will preserve  and thus separate all the superior individuals, allowing them freely  to intercross, and will destroy all the inferior individuals.
 By this  process long-continued, which exactly corresponds with what I have  called unconscious selection by man, combined, no doubt, in a most  important manner with the inherited effects of the increased use of  parts, it seems to me almost certain that an ordinary hoofed quadruped  might be converted into a giraffe.
    To this conclusion Mr. Mivart brings forward two objections.
 One is  that the increased size of the body would obviously require an increased  supply of food, and he considers it as "very problematical whether the  disadvantages thence arising would not, in times of scarcity, more than  counterbalance the advantages.
" But as the giraffe does actually exist  in large numbers in Africa, and as some of the largest antelopes in the  world, taller than an ox, abound there, why should we doubt that, as  far as size is concerned, intermediate gradations could formerly have  existed there, subjected as now to severe dearths.
 Assuredly the being  able to reach, at each stage of increased size, to a supply of food,  left untouched by the other hoofed quadrupeds of the country, would have  been of some advantage to the nascent giraffe.
 Nor must we overlook the  fact, that increased bulk would act as a protection against almost all  beasts of prey excepting the lion; and against this animal, its tall  neck--and the taller the better--would, as Mr. Chauncey Wright has  remarked, serve as a watch-tower.
 It is from this cause, as Sir S.
 Baker  remarks, that no animal is more difficult to stalk than the giraffe.
  This animal also uses its long neck as a means of offence or defence,  by violently swinging its head armed with stump-like horns.
 The  preservation of each species can rarely be determined by any one  advantage, but by the union of all, great and small.
    Mr. Mivart then asks (and this is his second objection), if natural  selection be so potent, and if high browsing be so great an advantage,  why has not any other hoofed quadruped acquired a long neck and lofty  stature, besides the giraffe, and, in a lesser degree, the camel,  guanaco and macrauchenia? Or, again, why has not any member of the  group acquired a long proboscis? With respect to South Africa, which was  formerly inhabited by numerous herds of the giraffe, the answer is not  difficult, and can best be given by an illustration.
 In every meadow  in England, in which trees grow, we see the lower branches trimmed or  planed to an exact level by the browsing of the horses or cattle; and  what advantage would it be, for instance, to sheep, if kept there, to  acquire slightly longer necks? In every district some one kind of animal  will almost certainly be able to browse higher than the others; and it  is almost equally certain that this one kind alone could have its neck  elongated for this purpose, through natural selection and the effects  of increased use.
 In South Africa the competition for browsing on the  higher branches of the acacias and other trees must be between giraffe  and giraffe, and not with the other ungulate animals.
    Why, in other quarters of the world, various animals belonging to this  same order have not acquired either an elongated neck or a proboscis,  cannot be distinctly answered; but it is as unreasonable to expect a  distinct answer to such a question as why some event in the history of  mankind did not occur in one country while it did in another.
 We are  ignorant with respect to the conditions which determine the numbers and  range of each species, and we cannot even conjecture what changes of  structure would be favourable to its increase in some new country.
 We  can, however, see in a general manner that various causes might have  interfered with the development of a long neck or proboscis.
 To reach  the foliage at a considerable height (without climbing, for which hoofed  animals are singularly ill-constructed) implies greatly increased  bulk of body; and we know that some areas support singularly few large  quadrupeds, for instance South America, though it is so luxuriant,  while South Africa abounds with them to an unparalleled degree.
 Why this  should be so we do not know; nor why the later tertiary periods should  have been much more favourable for their existence than the present  time.
 Whatever the causes may have been, we can see that certain  districts and times would have been much more favourable than others for  the development of so large a quadruped as the giraffe.
    In order that an animal should acquire some structure specially and  largely developed, it is almost indispensable that several other parts  should be modified and coadapted.
 Although every part of the body varies  slightly, it does not follow that the necessary parts should always  vary in the right direction and to the right degree.
 With the different  species of our domesticated animals we know that the parts vary in  a different manner and degree, and that some species are much more  variable than others.
 Even if the fitting variations did arise, it  does not follow that natural selection would be able to act on them and  produce a structure which apparently would be beneficial to the species.
  For instance, if the number of individuals existing in a country is  determined chiefly through destruction by beasts of prey--by external  or internal parasites, etc.
--as seems often to be the case, then natural  selection will be able to do little, or will be greatly retarded, in  modifying any particular structure for obtaining food.
 Lastly, natural  selection is a slow process, and the same favourable conditions must  long endure in order that any marked effect should thus be produced.
  Except by assigning such general and vague reasons, we cannot explain  why, in many quarters of the world, hoofed quadrupeds have not acquired  much elongated necks or other means for browsing on the higher branches  of trees.
    Objections of the same nature as the foregoing have been advanced by  many writers.
 In each case various causes, besides the general ones just  indicated, have probably interfered with the acquisition through natural  selection of structures, which it is thought would be beneficial to  certain species.
 One writer asks, why has not the ostrich acquired the  power of flight? But a moment's reflection will show what an enormous  supply of food would be necessary to give to this bird of the desert  force to move its huge body through the air.
 Oceanic islands are  inhabited by bats and seals, but by no terrestrial mammals; yet as some  of these bats are peculiar species, they must have long inhabited their  present homes.
 Therefore Sir C.
 Lyell asks, and assigns certain reasons  in answer, why have not seals and bats given birth on such islands to  forms fitted to live on the land? But seals would necessarily be first  converted into terrestrial carnivorous animals of considerable size, and  bats into terrestrial insectivorous animals; for the former there would  be no prey; for the bats ground-insects would serve as food, but these  would already be largely preyed on by the reptiles or birds, which first  colonise and abound on most oceanic islands.
 Gradations of structure,  with each stage beneficial to a changing species, will be favoured only  under certain peculiar conditions.
 A strictly terrestrial animal, by  occasionally hunting for food in shallow water, then in streams or  lakes, might at last be converted into an animal so thoroughly aquatic  as to brave the open ocean.
 But seals would not find on oceanic  islands the conditions favourable to their gradual reconversion into a  terrestrial form.
 Bats, as formerly shown, probably acquired their  wings by at first gliding through the air from tree to tree, like the  so-called flying squirrels, for the sake of escaping from their enemies,  or for avoiding falls; but when the power of true flight had once been  acquired, it would never be reconverted back, at least for the above  purposes, into the less efficient power of gliding through the air.
  Bats, might, indeed, like many birds, have had their wings greatly  reduced in size, or completely lost, through disuse; but in this case  it would be necessary that they should first have acquired the power of  running quickly on the ground, by the aid of their hind legs alone, so  as to compete with birds or other ground animals; and for such a change  a bat seems singularly ill-fitted.
 These conjectural remarks have been  made merely to show that a transition of structure, with each step  beneficial, is a highly complex affair; and that there is nothing  strange in a transition not having occurred in any particular case.
    Lastly, more than one writer has asked why have some animals had their  mental powers more highly developed than others, as such development  would be advantageous to all? Why have not apes acquired the  intellectual powers of man? Various causes could be assigned; but as  they are conjectural, and their relative probability cannot be weighed,  it would be useless to give them.
 A definite answer to the latter  question ought not to be expected, seeing that no one can solve the  simpler problem, why, of two races of savages, one has risen higher in  the scale of civilisation than the other; and this apparently implies  increased brain power.
    We will return to Mr. Mivart's other objections.
 Insects often resemble  for the sake of protection various objects, such as green or decayed  leaves, dead twigs, bits of lichen, flowers, spines, excrement of birds,  and living insects; but to this latter point I shall hereafter recur.
  The resemblance is often wonderfully close, and is not confined to  colour, but extends to form, and even to the manner in which the insects  hold themselves.
 The caterpillars which project motionless like dead  twigs from the bushes on which they feed, offer an excellent instance of  a resemblance of this kind.
 The cases of the imitation of such objects  as the excrement of birds, are rare and exceptional.
 On this head,  Mr. Mivart remarks, "As, according to Mr. Darwin's theory, there is a  constant tendency to indefinite variation, and as the minute incipient  variations will be in ALL DIRECTIONS, they must tend to neutralize  each other, and at first to form such unstable modifications that it is  difficult, if not impossible, to see how such indefinite oscillations  of infinitesimal beginnings can ever build up a sufficiently appreciable  resemblance to a leaf, bamboo, or other object, for natural selection to  seize upon and perpetuate.
"    But in all the foregoing cases the insects in their original state  no doubt presented some rude and accidental resemblance to an object  commonly found in the stations frequented by them.
 Nor is this at  all improbable, considering the almost infinite number of surrounding  objects and the diversity in form and colour of the hosts of insects  which exist.
 As some rude resemblance is necessary for the first start,  we can understand how it is that the larger and higher animals do not  (with the exception, as far as I know, of one fish) resemble for the  sake of protection special objects, but only the surface which commonly  surrounds them, and this chiefly in colour.
 Assuming that an insect  originally happened to resemble in some degree a dead twig or a decayed  leaf, and that it varied slightly in many ways, then all the variations  which rendered the insect at all more like any such object, and thus  favoured its escape, would be preserved, while other variations would  be neglected and ultimately lost; or, if they rendered the insect at  all less like the imitated object, they would be eliminated.
 There would  indeed be force in Mr. Mivart's objection, if we were to attempt to  account for the above resemblances, independently of natural selection,  through mere fluctuating variability; but as the case stands there is  none.
    Nor can I see any force in Mr. Mivart's difficulty with respect to "the  last touches of perfection in the mimicry;" as in the case given by  Mr. Wallace, of a walking-stick insect (Ceroxylus laceratus), which  resembles "a stick grown over by a creeping moss or jungermannia.
"  So close was this resemblance, that a native Dyak maintained that the  foliaceous excrescences were really moss.
 Insects are preyed on by birds  and other enemies whose sight is probably sharper than ours, and  every grade in resemblance which aided an insect to escape notice or  detection, would tend towards its preservation; and the more perfect the  resemblance so much the better for the insect.
 Considering the nature  of the differences between the species in the group which includes  the above Ceroxylus, there is nothing improbable in this insect having  varied in the irregularities on its surface, and in these having become  more or less green-coloured; for in every group the characters which  differ in the several species are the most apt to vary, while the  generic characters, or those common to all the species, are the most  constant.
    The Greenland whale is one of the most wonderful animals in the world,  and the baleen, or whalebone, one of its greatest peculiarities.
 The  baleen consists of a row, on each side of the upper jaw, of about 300  plates or laminae, which stand close together transversely to the longer  axis of the mouth.
 Within the main row there are some subsidiary rows.
  The extremities and inner margins of all the plates are frayed into  stiff bristles, which clothe the whole gigantic palate, and serve to  strain or sift the water, and thus to secure the minute prey on which  these great animals subsist.
 The middle and longest lamina in the  Greenland whale is ten, twelve, or even fifteen feet in length; but in  the different species of Cetaceans there are gradations in length; the  middle lamina being in one species, according to Scoresby, four feet,  in another three, in another eighteen inches, and in the Balaenoptera  rostrata only about nine inches in length.
 The quality of the whalebone  also differs in the different species.
    With respect to the baleen, Mr. Mivart remarks that if it "had once  attained such a size and development as to be at all useful, then  its preservation and augmentation within serviceable limits would be  promoted by natural selection alone.
 But how to obtain the beginning of  such useful development?" In answer, it may be asked, why should not  the early progenitors of the whales with baleen have possessed a mouth  constructed something like the lamellated beak of a duck? Ducks,  like whales, subsist by sifting the mud and water; and the family has  sometimes been called Criblatores, or sifters.
 I hope that I may not  be misconstrued into saying that the progenitors of whales did actually  possess mouths lamellated like the beak of a duck.
 I wish only to show  that this is not incredible, and that the immense plates of baleen in  the Greenland whale might have been developed from such lamellae by  finely graduated steps, each of service to its possessor.
    The beak of a shoveller-duck (Spatula clypeata) is a more beautiful  and complex structure than the mouth of a whale.
 The upper mandible is  furnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me) with a row or  comb formed of 188 thin, elastic lamellae, obliquely bevelled so as to  be pointed, and placed transversely to the longer axis of the mouth.
  They arise from the palate, and are attached by flexible membrane to  the sides of the mandible.
 Those standing towards the middle are the  longest, being about one-third of an inch in length, and they project  fourteen one-hundredths of an inch beneath the edge.
 At their bases  there is a short subsidiary row of obliquely transverse lamellae.
 In  these several respects they resemble the plates of baleen in the mouth  of a whale.
 But towards the extremity of the beak they differ much, as  they project inward, instead of straight downward.
 The entire head of  the shoveller, though incomparably less bulky, is about one-eighteenth  of the length of the head of a moderately large Balaenoptera rostrata,  in which species the baleen is only nine inches long; so that if we were  to make the head of the shoveller as long as that of the Balaenoptera,  the lamellae would be six inches in length, that is, two-thirds of the  length of the baleen in this species of whale.
 The lower mandible of  the shoveller-duck is furnished with lamellae of equal length with these  above, but finer; and in being thus furnished it differs conspicuously  from the lower jaw of a whale, which is destitute of baleen.
 On the  other hand, the extremities of these lower lamellae are frayed into  fine bristly points, so that they thus curiously resemble the plates  of baleen.
 In the genus Prion, a member of the distinct family of the  Petrels, the upper mandible alone is furnished with lamellae, which are  well developed and project beneath the margin; so that the beak of this  bird resembles in this respect the mouth of a whale.
    From the highly developed structure of the shoveller's beak we may  proceed (as I have learned from information and specimens sent to me by  Mr. Salvin), without any great break, as far as fitness for sifting  is concerned, through the beak of the Merganetta armata, and in some  respects through that of the Aix sponsa, to the beak of the common  duck.
 In this latter species the lamellae are much coarser than in the  shoveller, and are firmly attached to the sides of the mandible; they  are only about fifty in number on each side, and do not project at  all beneath the margin.
 They are square-topped, and are edged with  translucent, hardish tissue, as if for crushing food.
 The edges of the  lower mandible are crossed by numerous fine ridges, which project very  little.
 Although the beak is thus very inferior as a sifter to that of  a shoveller, yet this bird, as every one knows, constantly uses it for  this purpose.
 There are other species, as I hear from Mr. Salvin, in  which the lamellae are considerably less developed than in the common  duck; but I do not know whether they use their beaks for sifting the  water.
    Turning to another group of the same family.
 In the Egyptian goose  (Chenalopex) the beak closely resembles that of the common duck; but the  lamellae are not so numerous, nor so distinct from each other, nor do  they project so much inward; yet this goose, as I am informed by Mr. E.
  Bartlett, "uses its bill like a duck by throwing the water out at the  corners.
" Its chief food, however, is grass, which it crops like the  common goose.
 In this latter bird the lamellae of the upper mandible  are much coarser than in the common duck, almost confluent, about  twenty-seven in number on each side, and terminating upward in  teeth-like knobs.
 The palate is also covered with hard rounded knobs.
  The edges of the lower mandible are serrated with teeth much more  prominent, coarser and sharper than in the duck.
 The common goose does  not sift the water, but uses its beak exclusively for tearing or cutting  herbage, for which purpose it is so well fitted that it can crop grass  closer than almost any other animal.
 There are other species of geese,  as I hear from Mr. Bartlett, in which the lamellae are less developed  than in the common goose.
    We thus see that a member of the duck family, with a beak constructed  like that of a common goose and adapted solely for grazing, or even  a member with a beak having less well-developed lamellae, might be  converted by small changes into a species like the Egyptian goose--this  into one like the common duck--and, lastly, into one like the shoveller,  provided with a beak almost exclusively adapted for sifting the water;  for this bird could hardly use any part of its beak, except the hooked  tip, for seizing or tearing solid food.
 The beak of a goose, as I may  add, might also be converted by small changes into one provided with  prominent, recurved teeth, like those of the Merganser (a member of the  same family), serving for the widely different purpose of securing live  fish.
    Returning to the whales.
 The Hyperoodon bidens is destitute of true  teeth in an efficient condition, but its palate is roughened, according  to Lacepede, with small unequal, hard points of horn.
 There is,  therefore, nothing improbable in supposing that some early Cetacean form  was provided with similar points of horn on the palate, but rather more  regularly placed, and which, like the knobs on the beak of the goose,  aided it in seizing or tearing its food.
 If so, it will hardly be denied  that the points might have been converted through variation and natural  selection into lamellae as well-developed as those of the Egyptian  goose, in which case they would have been used both for seizing objects  and for sifting the water; then into lamellae like those of the domestic  duck; and so onward, until they became as well constructed as those of  the shoveller, in which case they would have served exclusively as  a sifting apparatus.
 From this stage, in which the lamellae would be  two-thirds of the length of the plates of baleen in the Balaenoptera  rostrata, gradations, which may be observed in still-existing Cetaceans,  lead us onward to the enormous plates of baleen in the Greenland whale.
  Nor is there the least reason to doubt that each step in this scale  might have been as serviceable to certain ancient Cetaceans, with  the functions of the parts slowly changing during the progress of  development, as are the gradations in the beaks of the different  existing members of the duck-family.
 We should bear in mind that each  species of duck is subjected to a severe struggle for existence, and  that the structure of every part of its frame must be well adapted to  its conditions of life.
    The Pleuronectidae, or Flat-fish, are remarkable for their asymmetrical  bodies.
 They rest on one side--in the greater number of species on the  left, but in some on the right side; and occasionally reversed adult  specimens occur.
 The lower, or resting-surface, resembles at first sight  the ventral surface of an ordinary fish; it is of a white colour, less  developed in many ways than the upper side, with the lateral fins often  of smaller size.
 But the eyes offer the most remarkable peculiarity; for  they are both placed on the upper side of the head.
 During early youth,  however, they stand opposite to each other, and the whole body is then  symmetrical, with both sides equally coloured.
 Soon the eye proper to  the lower side begins to glide slowly round the head to the upper side;  but does not pass right through the skull, as was formerly thought to be  the case.
 It is obvious that unless the lower eye did thus travel round,  it could not be used by the fish while lying in its habitual position on  one side.
 The lower eye would, also, have been liable to be abraded by  the sandy bottom.
 That the Pleuronectidae are admirably adapted by  their flattened and asymmetrical structure for their habits of life,  is manifest from several species, such as soles, flounders, etc.
, being  extremely common.
 The chief advantages thus gained seem to be protection  from their enemies, and facility for feeding on the ground.
 The  different members, however, of the family present, as Schiodte  remarks, "a long series of forms exhibiting a gradual transition from  Hippoglossus pinguis, which does not in any considerable degree alter  the shape in which it leaves the ovum, to the soles, which are entirely  thrown to one side.
"    Mr. Mivart has taken up this case, and remarks that a sudden spontaneous  transformation in the position of the eyes is hardly conceivable, in  which I quite agree with him.
 He then adds: "If the transit was gradual,  then how such transit of one eye a minute fraction of the journey  towards the other side of the head could benefit the individual  is, indeed, far from clear.
 It seems, even, that such an incipient  transformation must rather have been injurious.
" But he might have found  an answer to this objection in the excellent observations published  in 1867 by Malm.
 The Pleuronectidae, while very young and still  symmetrical, with their eyes standing on opposite sides of the head,  cannot long retain a vertical position, owing to the excessive depth of  their bodies, the small size of their lateral fins, and to their being  destitute of a swim-bladder.
 Hence, soon growing tired, they fall to  the bottom on one side.
 While thus at rest they often twist, as Malm  observed, the lower eye upward, to see above them; and they do this so  vigorously that the eye is pressed hard against the upper part of the  orbit.
 The forehead between the eyes consequently becomes, as could be  plainly seen, temporarily contracted in breadth.
 On one occasion Malm  saw a young fish raise and depress the lower eye through an angular  distance of about seventy degrees.
    We should remember that the skull at this early age is cartilaginous and  flexible, so that it readily yields to muscular action.
 It is also known  with the higher animals, even after early youth, that the skull  yields and is altered in shape, if the skin or muscles be permanently  contracted through disease or some accident.
 With long-eared rabbits,  if one ear flops forward and downward, its weight drags forward all the  bones of the skull on the same side, of which I have given a figure.
  Malm states that the newly-hatched young of perches, salmon, and several  other symmetrical fishes, have the habit of occasionally resting on  one side at the bottom; and he has observed that they often then  strain their lower eyes so as to look upward; and their skulls are thus  rendered rather crooked.
 These fishes, however, are soon able to hold  themselves in a vertical position, and no permanent effect is thus  produced.
 With the Pleuronectidae, on the other hand, the older they  grow the more habitually they rest on one side, owing to the increasing  flatness of their bodies, and a permanent effect is thus produced on the  form of the head, and on the position of the eyes.
 Judging from analogy,  the tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the  principle of inheritance.
 Schiodte believes, in opposition to some other  naturalists, that the Pleuronectidae are not quite symmetrical even  in the embryo; and if this be so, we could understand how it is that  certain species, while young, habitually fall over and rest on the left  side, and other species on the right side.
 Malm adds, in confirmation  of the above view, that the adult Trachypterus arcticus, which is not a  member of the Pleuronectidae, rests on its left side at the bottom, and  swims diagonally through the water; and in this fish, the two sides  of the head are said to be somewhat dissimilar.
 Our great authority  on Fishes, Dr.
 Gunther, concludes his abstract of Malm's paper, by  remarking that "the author gives a very simple explanation of the  abnormal condition of the Pleuronectoids.
"    We thus see that the first stages of the transit of the eye from one  side of the head to the other, which Mr. Mivart considers would be  injurious, may be attributed to the habit, no doubt beneficial to the  individual and to the species, of endeavouring to look upward with both  eyes, while resting on one side at the bottom.
 We may also attribute to  the inherited effects of use the fact of the mouth in several kinds  of flat-fish being bent towards the lower surface, with the jaw bones  stronger and more effective on this, the eyeless side of the head, than  on the other, for the sake, as Dr.
 Traquair supposes, of feeding with  ease on the ground.
 Disuse, on the other hand, will account for the less  developed condition of the whole inferior half of the body, including  the lateral fins; though Yarrel thinks that the reduced size of these  fins is advantageous to the fish, as "there is so much less room for  their action than with the larger fins above.
" Perhaps the lesser number  of teeth in the proportion of four to seven in the upper halves of the  two jaws of the plaice, to twenty-five to thirty in the lower halves,  may likewise be accounted for by disuse.
 From the colourless state of  the ventral surface of most fishes and of many other animals, we may  reasonably suppose that the absence of colour in flat-fish on the side,  whether it be the right or left, which is under-most, is due to the  exclusion of light.
 But it cannot be supposed that the peculiar speckled  appearance of the upper side of the sole, so like the sandy bed of the  sea, or the power in some species, as recently shown by Pouchet, of  changing their colour in accordance with the surrounding surface, or the  presence of bony tubercles on the upper side of the turbot, are due to  the action of the light.
 Here natural selection has probably come into  play, as well as in adapting the general shape of the body of these  fishes, and many other peculiarities, to their habits of life.
 We should  keep in mind, as I have before insisted, that the inherited effects  of the increased use of parts, and perhaps of their disuse, will be  strengthened by natural selection.
 For all spontaneous variations in the  right direction will thus be preserved; as will those individuals  which inherit in the highest degree the effects of the increased and  beneficial use of any part.
 How much to attribute in each particular  case to the effects of use, and how much to natural selection, it seems  impossible to decide.
    I may give another instance of a structure which apparently owes its  origin exclusively to use or habit.
 The extremity of the tail in  some American monkeys has been converted into a wonderfully perfect  prehensile organ, and serves as a fifth hand.
 A reviewer, who agrees  with Mr. Mivart in every detail, remarks on this structure: "It is  impossible to believe that in any number of ages the first slight  incipient tendency to grasp could preserve the lives of the individuals  possessing it, or favour their chance of having and of rearing  offspring.
" But there is no necessity for any such belief.
 Habit, and  this almost implies that some benefit great or small is thus derived,  would in all probability suffice for the work.
 Brehm saw the young of  an African monkey (Cercopithecus) clinging to the under surface of their  mother by their hands, and at the same time they hooked their little  tails round that of their mother.
 Professor Henslow kept in confinement  some harvest mice (Mus messorius) which do not possess a structurally  prehensive tail; but he frequently observed that they curled their  tails round the branches of a bush placed in the cage, and thus aided  themselves in climbing.
 I have received an analogous account from Dr.
  Gunther, who has seen a mouse thus suspend itself.
 If the harvest mouse  had been more strictly arboreal, it would perhaps have had its tail  rendered structurally prehensile, as is the case with some members of  the same order.
 Why Cercopithecus, considering its habits while young,  has not become thus provided, it would be difficult to say.
 It is,  however, possible that the long tail of this monkey may be of more  service to it as a balancing organ in making its prodigious leaps, than  as a prehensile organ.
    The mammary glands are common to the whole class of mammals, and are  indispensable for their existence; they must, therefore, have been  developed at an extremely remote period, and we can know nothing  positively about their manner of development.
 Mr. Mivart asks: "Is it  conceivable that the young of any animal was ever saved from destruction  by accidentally sucking a drop of scarcely nutritious fluid from an  accidentally hypertrophied cutaneous gland of its mother? And even  if one was so, what chance was there of the perpetuation of such a  variation?" But the case is not here put fairly.
 It is admitted by most  evolutionists that mammals are descended from a marsupial form; and  if so, the mammary glands will have been at first developed within  the marsupial sack.
 In the case of the fish (Hippocampus) the eggs are  hatched, and the young are reared for a time, within a sack of this  nature; and an American naturalist, Mr. Lockwood, believes from what he  has seen of the development of the young, that they are nourished by  a secretion from the cutaneous glands of the sack.
 Now, with the  early progenitors of mammals, almost before they deserved to be thus  designated, is it not at least possible that the young might have been  similarly nourished? And in this case, the individuals which secreted a  fluid, in some degree or manner the most nutritious, so as to partake of  the nature of milk, would in the long run have reared a larger number  of well-nourished offspring, than would the individuals which secreted a  poorer fluid; and thus the cutaneous glands, which are the homologues of  the mammary glands, would have been improved or rendered more effective.
  It accords with the widely extended principle of specialisation, that  the glands over a certain space of the sack should have become more  highly developed than the remainder; and they would then have formed a  breast, but at first without a nipple, as we see in the Ornithorhyncus,  at the base of the mammalian series.
 Through what agency the glands over  a certain space became more highly specialised than the others, I will  not pretend to decide, whether in part through compensation of growth,  the effects of use, or of natural selection.
    The development of the mammary glands would have been of no service, and  could not have been affected through natural selection, unless the young  at the same time were able to partake of the secretion.
 There is no  greater difficulty in understanding how young mammals have instinctively  learned to suck the breast, than in understanding how unhatched chickens  have learned to break the egg-shell by tapping against it with their  specially adapted beaks; or how a few hours after leaving the shell they  have learned to pick up grains of food.
 In such cases the most probable  solution seems to be, that the habit was at first acquired by practice  at a more advanced age, and afterwards transmitted to the offspring  at an earlier age.
 But the young kangaroo is said not to suck, only to  cling to the nipple of its mother, who has the power of injecting milk  into the mouth of her helpless, half-formed offspring.
 On this head  Mr. Mivart remarks: "Did no special provision exist, the young one must  infallibly be choked by the intrusion of the milk into the wind-pipe.
  But there IS a special provision.
 The larynx is so elongated that  it rises up into the posterior end of the nasal passage, and is thus  enabled to give free entrance to the air for the lungs, while the milk  passes harmlessly on each side of this elongated larynx, and so safely  attains the gullet behind it.
" Mr. Mivart then asks how did natural  selection remove in the adult kangaroo (and in most other mammals, on  the assumption that they are descended from a marsupial form), "this at  least perfectly innocent and harmless structure?" It may be suggested  in answer that the voice, which is certainly of high importance to many  animals, could hardly have been used with full force as long as the  larynx entered the nasal passage; and Professor Flower has suggested  to me that this structure would have greatly interfered with an animal  swallowing solid food.
    We will now turn for a short space to the lower divisions of the  animal kingdom.
 The Echinodermata (star-fishes, sea-urchins, etc.
) are  furnished with remarkable organs, called pedicellariae, which consist,  when well developed, of a tridactyle forceps--that is, of one formed of  three serrated arms, neatly fitting together and placed on the summit of  a flexible stem, moved by muscles.
 These forceps can seize firmly hold  of any object; and Alexander Agassiz has seen an Echinus or sea-urchin  rapidly passing particles of excrement from forceps to forceps down  certain lines of its body, in order that its shell should not be fouled.
  But there is no doubt that besides removing dirt of all kinds, they  subserve other functions; and one of these apparently is defence.
    With respect to these organs, Mr. Mivart, as on so many previous  occasions, asks: "What would be the utility of the FIRST RUDIMENTARY  BEGINNINGS of such structures, and how could such insipient buddings  have ever preserved the life of a single Echinus?" He adds, "not even  the SUDDEN development of the snapping action would have been beneficial  without the freely movable stalk, nor could the latter have been  efficient without the snapping jaws, yet no minute, nearly indefinite  variations could simultaneously evolve these complex co-ordinations of  structure; to deny this seems to do no less than to affirm a startling  paradox.
" Paradoxical as this may appear to Mr. Mivart, tridactyle  forcepses, immovably fixed at the base, but capable of a snapping  action, certainly exist on some star-fishes; and this is intelligible  if they serve, at least in part, as a means of defence.
 Mr. Agassiz, to  whose great kindness I am indebted for much information on the subject,  informs me that there are other star-fishes, in which one of the three  arms of the forceps is reduced to a support for the other two; and  again, other genera in which the third arm is completely lost.
 In  Echinoneus, the shell is described by M.
 Perrier as bearing two kinds of  pedicellariae, one resembling those of Echinus, and the other those of  Spatangus; and such cases are always interesting as affording the means  of apparently sudden transitions, through the abortion of one of the two  states of an organ.
    With respect to the steps by which these curious organs have been  evolved, Mr. Agassiz infers from his own researches and those of Mr.  Muller, that both in star-fishes and sea-urchins the pedicellariae must  undoubtedly be looked at as modified spines.
 This may be inferred from  their manner of development in the individual, as well as from a long  and perfect series of gradations in different species and genera, from  simple granules to ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle pedicellariae.
  The gradation extends even to the manner in which ordinary spines  and the pedicellariae, with their supporting calcareous rods, are  articulated to the shell.
 In certain genera of star-fishes, "the very  combinations needed to show that the pedicellariae are only modified  branching spines" may be found.
 Thus we have fixed spines, with three  equi-distant, serrated, movable branches, articulated to near their  bases; and higher up, on the same spine, three other movable branches.
  Now when the latter arise from the summit of a spine they form, in fact,  a rude tridactyle pedicellariae, and such may be seen on the same spine  together with the three lower branches.
 In this case the identity in  nature between the arms of the pedicellariae and the movable branches  of a spine, is unmistakable.
 It is generally admitted that the ordinary  spines serve as a protection; and if so, there can be no reason to doubt  that those furnished with serrated and movable branches likewise serve  for the same purpose; and they would thus serve still more effectively  as soon as by meeting together they acted as a prehensile or snapping  apparatus.
 Thus every gradation, from an ordinary fixed spine to a fixed  pedicellariae, would be of service.
    In certain genera of star-fishes these organs, instead of being fixed  or borne on an immovable support, are placed on the summit of a flexible  and muscular, though short, stem; and in this case they probably  subserve some additional function besides defence.
 In the sea-urchins  the steps can be followed by which a fixed spine becomes articulated to  the shell, and is thus rendered movable.
 I wish I had space here to  give a fuller abstract of Mr. Agassiz's interesting observations on the  development of the pedicellariae.
 All possible gradations, as he adds,  may likewise be found between the pedicellariae of the star-fishes and  the hooks of the Ophiurians, another group of the Echinodermata; and  again between the pedicellariae of sea-urchins and the anchors of the  Holothuriae, also belonging to the same great class.
    Certain compound animals, or zoophytes, as they have been termed, namely  the Polyzoa, are provided with curious organs called avicularia.
 These  differ much in structure in the different species.
 In their most perfect  condition they curiously resemble the head and beak of a vulture in  miniature, seated on a neck and capable of movement, as is likewise the  lower jaw or mandible.
 In one species observed by me, all the avicularia  on the same branch often moved simultaneously backwards and forwards,  with the lower jaw widely open, through an angle of about 90 degrees,  in the course of five seconds; and their movement caused the whole  polyzoary to tremble.
 When the jaws are touched with a needle they seize  it so firmly that the branch can thus be shaken.
    Mr. Mivart adduces this case, chiefly on account of the supposed  difficulty of organs, namely the avicularia of the Polyzoa and the  pedicellariae of the Echinodermata, which he considers as "essentially  similar," having been developed through natural selection in widely  distinct divisions of the animal kingdom.
 But, as far as structure is  concerned, I can see no similarity between tridactyle pedicellariae and  avicularia.
 The latter resembles somewhat more closely the chelae or  pincers of Crustaceans; and Mr. Mivart might have adduced with equal  appropriateness this resemblance as a special difficulty, or even their  resemblance to the head and beak of a bird.
 The avicularia are believed  by Mr. Busk, Dr.
 Smitt and Dr.
 Nitsche--naturalists who have carefully  studied this group--to be homologous with the zooids and their  cells which compose the zoophyte, the movable lip or lid of the cell  corresponding with the lower and movable mandible of the avicularium.
  Mr. Busk, however, does not know of any gradations now existing between  a zooid and an avicularium.
 It is therefore impossible to conjecture by  what serviceable gradations the one could have been converted into the  other, but it by no means follows from this that such gradations have  not existed.
    As the chelae of Crustaceans resemble in some degree the avicularia of  Polyzoa, both serving as pincers, it may be worth while to show that  with the former a long series of serviceable gradations still exists.
 In  the first and simplest stage, the terminal segment of a limb shuts down  either on the square summit of the broad penultimate segment, or against  one whole side, and is thus enabled to catch hold of an object, but the  limb still serves as an organ of locomotion.
 We next find one corner of  the broad penultimate segment slightly prominent, sometimes furnished  with irregular teeth, and against these the terminal segment shuts down.
  By an increase in the size of this projection, with its shape, as well  as that of the terminal segment, slightly modified and improved, the  pincers are rendered more and more perfect, until we have at last  an instrument as efficient as the chelae of a lobster.
 And all these  gradations can be actually traced.
    Besides the avicularia, the polyzoa possess curious organs called  vibracula.
 These generally consist of long bristles, capable of movement  and easily excited.
 In one species examined by me the vibracula were  slightly curved and serrated along the outer margin, and all of them on  the same polyzoary often moved simultaneously; so that, acting like  long oars, they swept a branch rapidly across the object-glass of my  microscope.
 When a branch was placed on its face, the vibracula became  entangled, and they made violent efforts to free themselves.
 They are  supposed to serve as a defence, and may be seen, as Mr. Busk remarks,  "to sweep slowly and carefully over the surface of the polyzoary,  removing what might be noxious to the delicate inhabitants of the cells  when their tentacula are protruded.
" The avicularia, like the vibracula,  probably serve for defence, but they also catch and kill small living  animals, which, it is believed, are afterwards swept by the currents  within reach of the tentacula of the zooids.
 Some species are provided  with avicularia and vibracula, some with avicularia alone and a few with  vibracula alone.
    It is not easy to imagine two objects more widely different in  appearance than a bristle or vibraculum, and an avicularium like the  head of a bird; yet they are almost certainly homologous and have been  developed from the same common source, namely a zooid with its cell.
  Hence, we can understand how it is that these organs graduate in some  cases, as I am informed by Mr. Busk, into each other.
 Thus, with the  avicularia of several species of Lepralia, the movable mandible is so  much produced and is so like a bristle that the presence of the upper  or fixed beak alone serves to determine its avicularian nature.
 The  vibracula may have been directly developed from the lips of the cells,  without having passed through the avicularian stage; but it seems more  probable that they have passed through this stage, as during the early  stages of the transformation, the other parts of the cell, with the  included zooid, could hardly have disappeared at once.
 In many cases the  vibracula have a grooved support at the base, which seems to represent  the fixed beak; though this support in some species is quite absent.
  This view of the development of the vibracula, if trustworthy, is  interesting; for supposing that all the species provided with avicularia  had become extinct, no one with the most vivid imagination would ever  have thought that the vibracula had originally existed as part of an  organ, resembling a bird's head, or an irregular box or hood.
 It is  interesting to see two such widely different organs developed from a  common origin; and as the movable lip of the cell serves as a protection  to the zooid, there is no difficulty in believing that all the  gradations, by which the lip became converted first into the lower  mandible of an avicularium, and then into an elongated bristle,  likewise served as a protection in different ways and under different  circumstances.
    In the vegetable kingdom Mr. Mivart only alludes to two cases, namely  the structure of the flowers of orchids, and the movements of climbing  plants.
 With respect to the former, he says: "The explanation of their  ORIGIN is deemed thoroughly unsatisfactory--utterly insufficient to  explain the incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of structures which are  of utility only when they are considerably developed.
" As I have fully  treated this subject in another work, I will here give only a few  details on one alone of the most striking peculiarities of the flowers  of orchids, namely, their pollinia.
 A pollinium, when highly developed,  consists of a mass of pollen-grains, affixed to an elastic foot-stalk  or caudicle, and this to a little mass of extremely viscid matter.
 The  pollinia are by this means transported by insects from one flower to  the stigma of another.
 In some orchids there is no caudicle to the  pollen-masses, and the grains are merely tied together by fine threads;  but as these are not confined to orchids, they need not here be  considered; yet I may mention that at the base of the orchidaceous  series, in Cypripedium, we can see how the threads were probably  first developed.
 In other orchids the threads cohere at one end of the  pollen-masses; and this forms the first or nascent trace of a caudicle.
  That this is the origin of the caudicle, even when of considerable  length and highly developed, we have good evidence in the aborted  pollen-grains which can sometimes be detected embedded within the  central and solid parts.
    With respect to the second chief peculiarity, namely, the little mass  of viscid matter attached to the end of the caudicle, a long series of  gradations can be specified, each of plain service to the plant.
 In most  flowers belonging to other orders the stigma secretes a little viscid  matter.
 Now, in certain orchids similar viscid matter is secreted, but  in much larger quantities by one alone of the three stigmas; and this  stigma, perhaps in consequence of the copious secretion, is rendered  sterile.
 When an insect visits a flower of this kind, it rubs off some  of the viscid matter, and thus at the same time drags away some of the  pollen-grains.
 From this simple condition, which differs but  little from that of a multitude of common flowers, there are endless  gradations--to species in which the pollen-mass terminates in a very  short, free caudicle--to others in which the caudicle becomes firmly  attached to the viscid matter, with the sterile stigma itself much  modified.
 In this latter case we have a pollinium in its most highly  developed and perfect condition.
 He who will carefully examine the  flowers of orchids for himself will not deny the existence of the above  series of gradations--from a mass of pollen-grains merely tied together  by threads, with the stigma differing but little from that of the  ordinary flowers, to a highly complex pollinium, admirably adapted for  transportal by insects; nor will he deny that all the gradations in  the several species are admirably adapted in relation to the general  structure of each flower for its fertilisation by different insects.
 In  this, and in almost every other case, the enquiry may be pushed further  backwards; and it may be asked how did the stigma of an ordinary flower  become viscid, but as we do not know the full history of any one  group of beings, it is as useless to ask, as it is hopeless to attempt  answering, such questions.
    We will now turn to climbing plants.
 These can be arranged in a long  series, from those which simply twine round a support, to those which I  have called leaf-climbers, and to those provided with tendrils.
 In these  two latter classes the stems have generally, but not always, lost the  power of twining, though they retain the power of revolving, which the  tendrils likewise possess.
 The gradations from leaf-climbers to tendril  bearers are wonderfully close, and certain plants may be differently  placed in either class.
 But in ascending the series from simple twiners  to leaf-climbers, an important quality is added, namely sensitiveness  to a touch, by which means the foot-stalks of the leaves or flowers, or  these modified and converted into tendrils, are excited to bend round  and clasp the touching object.
 He who will read my memoir on these  plants will, I think, admit that all the many gradations in function and  structure between simple twiners and tendril-bearers are in each case  beneficial in a high degree to the species.
 For instance, it is clearly  a great advantage to a twining plant to become a leaf-climber; and it is  probable that every twiner which possessed leaves with long foot-stalks  would have been developed into a leaf-climber, if the foot-stalks had  possessed in any slight degree the requisite sensitiveness to a touch.
    As twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms the  basis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants acquire  this power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved and  increased through natural selection.
 The power of twining depends,  firstly, on the stems while young being extremely flexible (but this  is a character common to many plants which are not climbers); and,  secondly, on their continually bending to all points of the compass, one  after the other in succession, in the same order.
 By this movement the  stems are inclined to all sides, and are made to move round and round.
  As soon as the lower part of a stem strikes against any object and is  stopped, the upper part still goes on bending and revolving, and thus  necessarily twines round and up the support.
 The revolving movement  ceases after the early growth of each shoot.
 As in many widely separated  families of plants, single species and single genera possess the power  of revolving, and have thus become twiners, they must have independently  acquired it, and cannot have inherited it from a common progenitor.
  Hence, I was led to predict that some slight tendency to a movement of  this kind would be found to be far from uncommon with plants which did  not climb; and that this had afforded the basis for natural selection  to work on and improve.
 When I made this prediction, I knew of only one  imperfect case, namely, of the young flower-peduncles of a Maurandia  which revolved slightly and irregularly, like the stems of twining  plants, but without making any use of this habit.
 Soon afterwards  Fritz Muller discovered that the young stems of an Alisma and of a  Linum--plants which do not climb and are widely separated in the natural  system--revolved plainly, though irregularly, and he states that he has  reason to suspect that this occurs with some other plants.
 These slight  movements appear to be of no service to the plants in question; anyhow,  they are not of the least use in the way of climbing, which is the point  that concerns us.
 Nevertheless we can see that if the stems of these  plants had been flexible, and if under the conditions to which they are  exposed it had profited them to ascend to a height, then the habit  of slightly and irregularly revolving might have been increased and  utilised through natural selection, until they had become converted into  well-developed twining species.
    With respect to the sensitiveness of the foot-stalks of the leaves and  flowers, and of tendrils, nearly the same remarks are applicable as in  the case of the revolving movements of twining plants.
 As a vast number  of species, belonging to widely distinct groups, are endowed with this  kind of sensitiveness, it ought to be found in a nascent condition in  many plants which have not become climbers.
 This is the case: I observed  that the young flower-peduncles of the above Maurandia curved themselves  a little towards the side which was touched.
 Morren found in several  species of Oxalis that the leaves and their foot-stalks moved,  especially after exposure to a hot sun, when they were gently and  repeatedly touched, or when the plant was shaken.
 I repeated these  observations on some other species of Oxalis with the same result; in  some of them the movement was distinct, but was best seen in the young  leaves; in others it was extremely slight.
 It is a more important fact  that according to the high authority of Hofmeister, the young shoots and  leaves of all plants move after being shaken; and with climbing plants  it is, as we know, only during the early stages of growth that the  foot-stalks and tendrils are sensitive.
    It is scarcely possible that the above slight movements, due to a touch  or shake, in the young and growing organs of plants, can be of any  functional importance to them.
 But plants possess, in obedience to  various stimuli, powers of movement, which are of manifest importance  to them; for instance, towards and more rarely from the light--in  opposition to, and more rarely in the direction of, the attraction  of gravity.
 When the nerves and muscles of an animal are excited by  galvanism or by the absorption of strychnine, the consequent movements  may be called an incidental result, for the nerves and muscles have not  been rendered specially sensitive to these stimuli.
 So with plants it  appears that, from having the power of movement in obedience to certain  stimuli, they are excited in an incidental manner by a touch, or by  being shaken.
 Hence there is no great difficulty in admitting that in  the case of leaf-climbers and tendril-bearers, it is this tendency which  has been taken advantage of and increased through natural selection.
 It  is, however, probable, from reasons which I have assigned in my memoir,  that this will have occurred only with plants which had already acquired  the power of revolving, and had thus become twiners.
    I have already endeavoured to explain how plants became twiners,  namely, by the increase of a tendency to slight and irregular revolving  movements, which were at first of no use to them; this movement, as  well as that due to a touch or shake, being the incidental result of  the power of moving, gained for other and beneficial purposes.
 Whether,  during the gradual development of climbing plants, natural selection  has been aided by the inherited effects of use, I will not pretend to  decide; but we know that certain periodical movements, for instance the  so-called sleep of plants, are governed by habit.
    I have now considered enough, perhaps more than enough, of the cases,  selected with care by a skilful naturalist, to prove that natural  selection is incompetent to account for the incipient stages of  useful structures; and I have shown, as I hope, that there is no great  difficulty on this head.
 A good opportunity has thus been afforded for  enlarging a little on gradations of structure, often associated with  strange functions--an important subject, which was not treated at  sufficient length in the former editions of this work.
 I will now  briefly recapitulate the foregoing cases.
    With the giraffe, the continued preservation of the individuals of some  extinct high-reaching ruminant, which had the longest necks, legs, etc.
,  and could browse a little above the average height, and the continued  destruction of those which could not browse so high, would have sufficed  for the production of this remarkable quadruped; but the prolonged  use of all the parts, together with inheritance, will have aided in an  important manner in their co-ordination.
 With the many insects which  imitate various objects, there is no improbability in the belief that  an accidental resemblance to some common object was in each case the  foundation for the work of natural selection, since perfected through  the occasional preservation of slight variations which made the  resemblance at all closer; and this will have been carried on as long  as the insect continued to vary, and as long as a more and more perfect  resemblance led to its escape from sharp-sighted enemies.
 In certain  species of whales there is a tendency to the formation of irregular  little points of horn on the palate; and it seems to be quite within the  scope of natural selection to preserve all favourable variations, until  the points were converted, first into lamellated knobs or teeth, like  those on the beak of a goose--then into short lamellae, like those of  the domestic ducks--and then into lamellae, as perfect as those of the  shoveller-duck--and finally into the gigantic plates of baleen, as  in the mouth of the Greenland whale.
 In the family of the ducks, the  lamellae are first used as teeth, then partly as teeth and partly as  a sifting apparatus, and at last almost exclusively for this latter  purpose.
    With such structures as the above lamellae of horn or whalebone, habit  or use can have done little or nothing, as far as we can judge, towards  their development.
 On the other hand, the transportal of the lower eye  of a flat-fish to the upper side of the head, and the formation of  a prehensile tail, may be attributed almost wholly to continued use,  together with inheritance.
 With respect to the mammae of the higher  animals, the most probable conjecture is that primordially the cutaneous  glands over the whole surface of a marsupial sack secreted a nutritious  fluid; and that these glands were improved in function through natural  selection, and concentrated into a confined area, in which case they  would have formed a mamma.
 There is no more difficulty in understanding  how the branched spines of some ancient Echinoderm, which served as  a defence, became developed through natural selection into tridactyle  pedicellariae, than in understanding the development of the pincers of  crustaceans, through slight, serviceable modifications in the ultimate  and penultimate segments of a limb, which was at first used solely  for locomotion.
 In the avicularia and vibracula of the Polyzoa we have  organs widely different in appearance developed from the same source;  and with the vibracula we can understand how the successive gradations  might have been of service.
 With the pollinia of orchids, the threads  which originally served to tie together the pollen-grains, can be traced  cohering into caudicles; and the steps can likewise be followed by which  viscid matter, such as that secreted by the stigmas of ordinary flowers,  and still subserving nearly but not quite the same purpose, became  attached to the free ends of the caudicles--all these gradations being  of manifest benefit to the plants in question.
 With respect to climbing  plants, I need not repeat what has been so lately said.
    It has often been asked, if natural selection be so potent, why has not  this or that structure been gained by certain species, to which it would  apparently have been advantageous? But it is unreasonable to expect a  precise answer to such questions, considering our ignorance of the past  history of each species, and of the conditions which at the present day  determine its numbers and range.
 In most cases only general reasons,  but in some few cases special reasons, can be assigned.
 Thus to adapt  a species to new habits of life, many co-ordinated modifications are  almost indispensable, and it may often have happened that the requisite  parts did not vary in the right manner or to the right degree.
 Many  species must have been prevented from increasing in numbers through  destructive agencies, which stood in no relation to certain structures,  which we imagine would have been gained through natural selection  from appearing to us advantageous to the species.
 In this case, as the  struggle for life did not depend on such structures, they could not  have been acquired through natural selection.
 In many cases complex and  long-enduring conditions, often of a peculiar nature, are necessary for  the development of a structure; and the requisite conditions may seldom  have concurred.
 The belief that any given structure, which we think,  often erroneously, would have been beneficial to a species, would  have been gained under all circumstances through natural selection, is  opposed to what we can understand of its manner of action.
 Mr. Mivart  does not deny that natural selection has effected something; but he  considers it as "demonstrably insufficient" to account for the phenomena  which I explain by its agency.
 His chief arguments have now been  considered, and the others will hereafter be considered.
 They seem to me  to partake little of the character of demonstration, and to have little  weight in comparison with those in favour of the power of natural  selection, aided by the other agencies often specified.
 I am bound to  add, that some of the facts and arguments here used by me, have been  advanced for the same purpose in an able article lately published in the  "Medico-Chirurgical Review.
"    At the present day almost all naturalists admit evolution under some  form.
 Mr. Mivart believes that species change through "an internal force  or tendency," about which it is not pretended that anything is known.
  That species have a capacity for change will be admitted by all  evolutionists; but there is no need, as it seems to me, to invoke  any internal force beyond the tendency to ordinary variability, which  through the aid of selection, by man has given rise to many well-adapted  domestic races, and which, through the aid of natural selection, would  equally well give rise by graduated steps to natural races or species.
  The final result will generally have been, as already explained, an  advance, but in some few cases a retrogression, in organisation.
    Mr. Mivart is further inclined to believe, and some naturalists agree  with him, that new species manifest themselves "with suddenness and by  modifications appearing at once.
" For instance, he supposes that the  differences between the extinct three-toed Hipparion and the horse arose  suddenly.
 He thinks it difficult to believe that the wing of a bird "was  developed in any other way than by a comparatively sudden modification  of a marked and important kind;" and apparently he would extend the  same view to the wings of bats and pterodactyles.
 This conclusion,  which implies great breaks or discontinuity in the series, appears to me  improbable in the highest degree.
    Everyone who believes in slow and gradual evolution, will of course  admit that specific changes may have been as abrupt and as great as  any single variation which we meet with under nature, or even under  domestication.
 But as species are more variable when domesticated or  cultivated than under their natural conditions, it is not probable that  such great and abrupt variations have often occurred under nature, as  are known occasionally to arise under domestication.
 Of these latter  variations several may be attributed to reversion; and the characters  which thus reappear were, it is probable, in many cases at first  gained in a gradual manner.
 A still greater number must be called  monstrosities, such as six-fingered men, porcupine men, Ancon sheep,  Niata cattle, etc.
; and as they are widely different in character from  natural species, they throw very little light on our subject.
 Excluding  such cases of abrupt variations, the few which remain would at best  constitute, if found in a state of nature, doubtful species, closely  related to their parental types.
    My reasons for doubting whether natural species have changed as abruptly  as have occasionally domestic races, and for entirely disbelieving that  they have changed in the wonderful manner indicated by Mr. Mivart, are  as follows.
 According to our experience, abrupt and strongly marked  variations occur in our domesticated productions, singly and at rather  long intervals of time.
 If such occurred under nature, they would  be liable, as formerly explained, to be lost by accidental causes of  destruction and by subsequent intercrossing; and so it is known to be  under domestication, unless abrupt variations of this kind are specially  preserved and separated by the care of man.
 Hence, in order that a new  species should suddenly appear in the manner supposed by Mr. Mivart,  it is almost necessary to believe, in opposition to all analogy, that  several wonderfully changed individuals appeared simultaneously within  the same district.
 This difficulty, as in the case of unconscious  selection by man, is avoided on the theory of gradual evolution, through  the preservation of a large number of individuals, which varied more  or less in any favourable direction, and of the destruction of a large  number which varied in an opposite manner.
    That many species have been evolved in an extremely gradual manner,  there can hardly be a doubt.
 The species and even the genera of many  large natural families are so closely allied together that it is  difficult to distinguish not a few of them.
 On every continent, in  proceeding from north to south, from lowland to upland, etc.
, we meet  with a host of closely related or representative species; as we likewise  do on certain distinct continents, which we have reason to believe were  formerly connected.
 But in making these and the following remarks, I am  compelled to allude to subjects hereafter to be discussed.
 Look at  the many outlying islands round a continent, and see how many of their  inhabitants can be raised only to the rank of doubtful species.
 So it is  if we look to past times, and compare the species which have just passed  away with those still living within the same areas; or if we compare  the fossil species embedded in the sub-stages of the same geological  formation.
 It is indeed manifest that multitudes of species are related  in the closest manner to other species that still exist, or have lately  existed; and it will hardly be maintained that such species have been  developed in an abrupt or sudden manner.
 Nor should it be forgotten,  when we look to the special parts of allied species, instead of to  distinct species, that numerous and wonderfully fine gradations can be  traced, connecting together widely different structures.
    Many large groups of facts are intelligible only on the principle that  species have been evolved by very small steps.
 For instance, the fact  that the species included in the larger genera are more closely related  to each other, and present a greater number of varieties than do the  species in the smaller genera.
 The former are also grouped in little  clusters, like varieties round species; and they present other analogies  with varieties, as was shown in our second chapter.
 On this same  principle we can understand how it is that specific characters are more  variable than generic characters; and how the parts which are developed  in an extraordinary degree or manner are more variable than other parts  of the same species.
 Many analogous facts, all pointing in the same  direction, could be added.
    Although very many species have almost certainly been produced by  steps not greater than those separating fine varieties; yet it may  be maintained that some have been developed in a different and abrupt  manner.
 Such an admission, however, ought not to be made without strong  evidence being assigned.
 The vague and in some respects false analogies,  as they have been shown to be by Mr. Chauncey Wright, which have been  advanced in favour of this view, such as the sudden crystallisation of  inorganic substances, or the falling of a facetted spheroid from one  facet to another, hardly deserve consideration.
 One class of facts,  however, namely, the sudden appearance of new and distinct forms of  life in our geological formations supports at first sight the belief in  abrupt development.
 But the value of this evidence depends entirely on  the perfection of the geological record, in relation to periods remote  in the history of the world.
 If the record is as fragmentary as many  geologists strenuously assert, there is nothing strange in new forms  appearing as if suddenly developed.
    Unless we admit transformations as prodigious as those advocated by Mr.  Mivart, such as the sudden development of the wings of birds or bats, or  the sudden conversion of a Hipparion into a horse, hardly any light  is thrown by the belief in abrupt modifications on the deficiency of  connecting links in our geological formations.
 But against the belief in  such abrupt changes, embryology enters a strong protest.
 It is notorious  that the wings of birds and bats, and the legs of horses or other  quadrupeds, are undistinguishable at an early embryonic period, and  that they become differentiated by insensibly fine steps.
 Embryological  resemblances of all kinds can be accounted for, as we shall hereafter  see, by the progenitors of our existing species having varied after  early youth, and having transmitted their newly-acquired characters to  their offspring, at a corresponding age.
 The embryo is thus left almost  unaffected, and serves as a record of the past condition of the species.
  Hence it is that existing species during the early stages of their  development so often resemble ancient and extinct forms belonging to the  same class.
 On this view of the meaning of embryological resemblances,  and indeed on any view, it is incredible that an animal should have  undergone such momentous and abrupt transformations as those above  indicated, and yet should not bear even a trace in its embryonic  condition of any sudden modification, every detail in its structure  being developed by insensibly fine steps.
    He who believes that some ancient form was transformed suddenly through  an internal force or tendency into, for instance, one furnished with  wings, will be almost compelled to assume, in opposition to all analogy,  that many individuals varied simultaneously.
 It cannot be denied that  such abrupt and great changes of structure are widely different from  those which most species apparently have undergone.
 He will further be  compelled to believe that many structures beautifully adapted to all the  other parts of the same creature and to the surrounding conditions,  have been suddenly produced; and of such complex and wonderful  co-adaptations, he will not be able to assign a shadow of an  explanation.
 He will be forced to admit that these great and sudden  transformations have left no trace of their action on the embryo.
  To admit all this is, as it seems to me, to enter into the realms of  miracle, and to leave those of science.
          .
 INSTINCT.
     Instincts comparable with habits, but different in their   origin--Instincts graduated--Aphides and ants--Instincts   variable--Domestic instincts, their origin--Natural instincts of   the cuckoo, molothrus, ostrich, and parasitic bees--Slave-making   ants--Hive-bee, its cell-making instinct--Changes of instinct and   structure not necessarily simultaneous--Difficulties of the theory of   the Natural Selection of instincts--Neuter or sterile insects--Summary.
      Many instincts are so wonderful that their development will probably  appear to the reader a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole  theory.
 I may here premise, that I have nothing to do with the origin of  the mental powers, any more than I have with that of life itself.
 We are  concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental  faculties in animals of the same class.
    I will not attempt any definition of instinct.
 It would be easy to show  that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term;  but every one understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct  impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds'  nests.
 An action, which we ourselves require experience to enable us to  perform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a very young  one, without experience, and when performed by many individuals in the  same way, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed, is  usually said to be instinctive.
 But I could show that none of these  characters are universal.
 A little dose of judgment or reason, as Pierre  Huber expresses it, often comes into play, even with animals low in the  scale of nature.
    Frederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared  instinct with habit.
 This comparison gives, I think, an accurate notion  of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed, but  not necessarily of its origin.
 How unconsciously many habitual actions  are performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious  will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason.
 Habits easily  become associated with other habits, with certain periods of time and  states of the body.
 When once acquired, they often remain constant  throughout life.
 Several other points of resemblance between instincts  and habits could be pointed out.
 As in repeating a well-known song,  so in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a  person be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is  generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of thought: so  P.
 Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes a very complicated  hammock; for if he took a caterpillar which had completed its hammock  up to, say, the sixth stage of construction, and put it into a  hammock completed up only to the third stage, the caterpillar simply  re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of construction.
  If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for  instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the  sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from  deriving any benefit from this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order  to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage,  where it had left off, and thus tried to complete the already finished  work.
    If we suppose any habitual action to become inherited--and it can be  shown that this does sometimes happen--then the resemblance between what  originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be  distinguished.
 If Mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three  years old with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune with no  practice at all, be might truly be said to have done so instinctively.
  But it would be a serious error to suppose that the greater number  of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation, and then  transmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations.
 It can be clearly  shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted,  namely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have  been acquired by habit.
    It will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as  corporeal structures for the welfare of each species, under its present  conditions of life.
 Under changed conditions of life, it is at least  possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a  species; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little,  then I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and  continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that was  profitable.
 It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and  wonderful instincts have originated.
 As modifications of corporeal  structure arise from, and are increased by, use or habit, and are  diminished or lost by disuse, so I do not doubt it has been with  instincts.
 But I believe that the effects of habit are in many cases of  subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of  what may be called spontaneous variations of instincts;--that is of  variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight  deviations of bodily structure.
    No complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection,  except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight, yet  profitable, variations.
 Hence, as in the case of corporeal structures,  we ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by  which each complex instinct has been acquired--for these could be found  only in the lineal ancestors of each species--but we ought to find in  the collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or  we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are  possible; and this we certainly can do.
 I have been surprised to find,  making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little  observed, except in Europe and North America, and for no instinct being  known among extinct species, how very generally gradations, leading to  the most complex instincts, can be discovered.
 Changes of instinct may  sometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts  at different periods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or  when placed under different circumstances, etc.
; in which case either  the one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection.
  And such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be  shown to occur in nature.
    Again, as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably to my  theory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never,  as far as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others.
  One of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an  action for the sole good of another, with which I am acquainted, is that  of aphides voluntarily yielding, as was first observed by Huber, their  sweet excretion to ants: that they do so voluntarily, the following  facts show.
 I removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides  on a dock-plant, and prevented their attendance during several hours.
  After this interval, I felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete.
  I watched them for some time through a lens, but not one excreted; I  then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner, as well  as I could, as the ants do with their antennae; but not one excreted.
  Afterwards, I allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately seemed,  by its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich flock it  had discovered; it then began to play with its antennae on the abdomen  first of one aphis and then of another; and each, as soon as it felt the  antennae, immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop  of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured by the ant.
 Even the quite  young aphides behaved in this manner, showing that the action was  instinctive, and not the result of experience.
 It is certain, from the  observations of Huber, that the aphides show no dislike to the ants:  if the latter be not present they are at last compelled to eject their  excretion.
 But as the excretion is extremely viscid, it is no doubt a  convenience to the aphides to have it removed; therefore probably they  do not excrete solely for the good of the ants.
 Although there is no  evidence that any animal performs an action for the exclusive good of  another species, yet each tries to take advantage of the instincts of  others, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of other  species.
 So again certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely  perfect; but as details on this and other such points are not  indispensable, they may be here passed over.
    As some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and  the inheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of  natural selection, as many instances as possible ought to be given; but  want of space prevents me.
 I can only assert that instincts certainly  do vary--for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent and  direction, and in its total loss.
 So it is with the nests of birds,  which vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the  nature and temperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes  wholly unknown to us.
 Audubon has given several remarkable cases  of differences in the nests of the same species in the northern and  southern United States.
 Why, it has been asked, if instinct be variable,  has it not granted to the bee "the ability to use some other material  when wax was deficient?" But what other natural material could bees  use? They will work, as I have seen, with wax hardened with vermilion  or softened with lard.
 Andrew Knight observed that his bees, instead of  laboriously collecting propolis, used a cement of wax and turpentine,  with which he had covered decorticated trees.
 It has lately been shown  that bees, instead of searching for pollen, will gladly use a very  different substance, namely, oatmeal.
 Fear of any particular enemy is  certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen in nestling birds,  though it is strengthened by experience, and by the sight of fear of the  same enemy in other animals.
 The fear of man is slowly acquired, as  I have elsewhere shown, by the various animals which inhabit desert  islands; and we see an instance of this, even in England, in the greater  wildness of all our large birds in comparison with our small birds;  for the large birds have been most persecuted by man.
 We may safely  attribute the greater wildness of our large birds to this cause; for in  uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small; and the  magpie, so wary in England, is tame in Norway, as is the hooded crow in  Egypt.
    That the mental qualities of animals of the same kind, born in a state  of nature, vary much, could be shown by many facts.
 Several cases could  also be adduced of occasional and strange habits in wild animals, which,  if advantageous to the species, might have given rise, through natural  selection, to new instincts.
 But I am well aware that these general  statements, without the facts in detail, can produce but a feeble effect  on the reader's mind.
 I can only repeat my assurance, that I do not  speak without good evidence.
    INHERITED CHANGES OF HABIT OR INSTINCT IN DOMESTICATED ANIMALS.
    The possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations  of instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly  considering a few cases under domestication.
 We shall thus be enabled  to see the part which habit and the selection of so-called spontaneous  variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic  animals.
 It is notorious how much domestic animals vary in their mental  qualities.
 With cats, for instance, one naturally takes to catching  rats, and another mice, and these tendencies are known to be inherited.
  One cat, according to Mr. St.
 John, always brought home game birds,  another hares or rabbits, and another hunted on marshy ground and almost  nightly caught woodcocks or snipes.
 A number of curious and authentic  instances could be given of various shades of disposition and taste, and  likewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain frames of mind or  periods of time.
 But let us look to the familiar case of the breeds  of dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers (I have myself seen  striking instances) will sometimes point and even back other dogs the  very first time that they are taken out; retrieving is certainly in some  degree inherited by retrievers; and a tendency to run round, instead of  at, a flock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs.
 I cannot see that these actions,  performed without experience by the young, and in nearly the same manner  by each individual, performed with eager delight by each breed, and  without the end being known--for the young pointer can no more know that  he points to aid his master, than the white butterfly knows why she lays  her eggs on the leaf of the cabbage--I cannot see that these actions  differ essentially from true instincts.
 If we were to behold one kind  of wolf, when young and without any training, as soon as it scented its  prey, stand motionless like a statue, and then slowly crawl forward with  a peculiar gait; and another kind of wolf rushing round, instead of at,  a herd of deer, and driving them to a distant point, we should assuredly  call these actions instinctive.
 Domestic instincts, as they may be  called, are certainly far less fixed than natural instincts; but  they have been acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have  been transmitted for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed  conditions of life.
    How strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are  inherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when  different breeds of dogs are crossed.
 Thus it is known that a cross with  a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy  of greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family  of shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares.
 These domestic instincts,  when thus tested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a  like manner become curiously blended together, and for a long period  exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent: for example, Le Roy  describes a dog, whose great-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog  showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way, by not coming in a  straight line to his master, when called.
    Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become  inherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this is  not true.
 No one would ever have thought of teaching, or probably could  have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble--an action which, as I have  witnessed, is performed by young birds, that have never seen a pigeon  tumble.
 We may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to  this strange habit, and that the long-continued selection of the best  individuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are;  and near Glasgow there are house-tumblers, as I hear from Mr. Brent,  which cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels.
 It  may be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to  point, had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line; and  this is known occasionally to happen, as I once saw, in a pure terrier:  the act of pointing is probably, as many have thought, only the  exaggerated pause of an animal preparing to spring on its prey.
 When the  first tendency to point was once displayed, methodical selection and the  inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation  would soon complete the work; and unconscious selection is still in  progress, as each man tries to procure, without intending to improve the  breed, dogs which stand and hunt best.
 On the other hand, habit alone  in some cases has sufficed; hardly any animal is more difficult to tame  than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely any animal is tamer than the  young of the tame rabbit; but I can hardly suppose that domestic rabbits  have often been selected for tameness alone; so that we must attribute  at least the greater part of the inherited change from extreme wildness  to extreme tameness, to habit and long-continued close confinement.
    Natural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of  this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become  "broody," that is, never wish to sit on their eggs.
 Familiarity alone  prevents our seeing how largely and how permanently the minds of our  domestic animals have been modified.
 It is scarcely possible to doubt  that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog.
 All wolves,  foxes, jackals and species of the cat genus, when kept tame, are most  eager to attack poultry, sheep and pigs; and this tendency has been  found incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from  countries such as Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where the savages do  not keep these domestic animals.
 How rarely, on the other hand, do  our civilised dogs, even when quite young, require to be taught not to  attack poultry, sheep, and pigs! No doubt they occasionally do make an  attack, and are then beaten; and if not cured, they are destroyed;  so that habit and some degree of selection have probably concurred in  civilising by inheritance our dogs.
 On the other hand, young chickens  have lost wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt  was originally instinctive in them, for I am informed by Captain Hutton  that the young chickens of the parent stock, the Gallus bankiva, when  reared in India under a hen, are at first excessively wild.
 So it is  with young pheasants reared in England under a hen.
 It is not that  chickens have lost all fear, but fear only of dogs and cats, for if  the hen gives the danger chuckle they will run (more especially young  turkeys) from under her and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass  or thickets; and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of  allowing, as we see in wild ground-birds, their mother to fly away.
  But this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under  domestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost by disuse the power of  flight.
    Hence, we may conclude that under domestication instincts have been  acquired and natural instincts have been lost, partly by habit and  partly by man selecting and accumulating, during successive generations,  peculiar mental habits and actions, which at first appeared from what we  must in our ignorance call an accident.
 In some cases compulsory habit  alone has sufficed to produce inherited mental changes; in other cases  compulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of  selection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most  cases habit and selection have probably concurred.
    SPECIAL INSTINCTS.
    We shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature  have become modified by selection by considering a few cases.
 I will  select only three, namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay  her eggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain  ants; and the cell-making power of the hive-bee: these two latter  instincts have generally and justly been ranked by naturalists as the  most wonderful of all known instincts.
    INSTINCTS OF THE CUCKOO.
    It is supposed by some naturalists that the more immediate cause of  the instinct of the cuckoo is that she lays her eggs, not daily, but  at intervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own  nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left  for some time unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds of  different ages in the same nest.
 If this were the case the process of  laying and hatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as  she migrates at a very early period; and the first hatched young would  probably have to be fed by the male alone.
 But the American cuckoo is  in this predicament, for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young  successively hatched, all at the same time.
 It has been both asserted  and denied that the American cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other  birds' nests; but I have lately heard from Dr.
 Merrill, of Iowa, that he  once found in Illinois a young cuckoo, together with a young jay in the  nest of a blue jay (Garrulus cristatus); and as both were nearly full  feathered, there could be no mistake in their identification.
 I could  also give several instances of various birds which have been known  occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds' nests.
 Now let us suppose  that the ancient progenitor of our European cuckoo had the habits of the  American cuckoo, and that she occasionally laid an egg in another bird's  nest.
 If the old bird profited by this occasional habit through being  enabled to emigrate earlier or through any other cause; or if the  young were made more vigorous by advantage being taken of the mistaken  instinct of another species than when reared by their own mother,  encumbered as she could hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of  different ages at the same time, then the old birds or the fostered  young would gain an advantage.
 And analogy would lead us to believe  that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the  occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn  would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and thus be  more successful in rearing their young.
 By a continued process of this  nature, I believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo has been  generated.
 It has, also recently been ascertained on sufficient  evidence, by Adolf Muller, that the cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs  on the bare ground, sits on them and feeds her young.
 This rare event  is probably a case of reversion to the long-lost, aboriginal instinct of  nidification.
    It has been objected that I have not noticed other related instincts  and adaptations of structure in the cuckoo, which are spoken of as  necessarily co-ordinated.
 But in all cases, speculation on an instinct  known to us only in a single species, is useless, for we have hitherto  had no facts to guide us.
 Until recently the instincts of the European  and of the non-parasitic American cuckoo alone were known; now, owing  to Mr. Ramsay's observations, we have learned something about three  Australian species, which lay their eggs in other birds' nests.
 The  chief points to be referred to are three: first, that the common cuckoo,  with rare exceptions, lays only one egg in a nest, so that the large and  voracious young bird receives ample food.
 Secondly, that the eggs are  remarkably small, not exceeding those of the skylark--a bird about  one-fourth as large as the cuckoo.
 That the small size of the egg is a  real case of adaptation we may infer from the fact of the mon-parasitic  American cuckoo laying full-sized eggs.
 Thirdly, that the young cuckoo,  soon after birth, has the instinct, the strength and a properly shaped  back for ejecting its foster-brothers, which then perish from cold and  hunger.
 This has been boldly called a beneficent arrangement, in  order that the young cuckoo may get sufficient food, and that its  foster-brothers may perish before they had acquired much feeling!    Turning now to the Australian species: though these birds generally lay  only one egg in a nest, it is not rare to find two and even three eggs  in the same nest.
 In the bronze cuckoo the eggs vary greatly in size,  from eight to ten lines in length.
 Now, if it had been of an advantage  to this species to have laid eggs even smaller than those now laid, so  as to have deceived certain foster-parents, or, as is more probable, to  have been hatched within a shorter period (for it is asserted that  there is a relation between the size of eggs and the period of their  incubation), then there is no difficulty in believing that a race or  species might have been formed which would have laid smaller and smaller  eggs; for these would have been more safely hatched and reared.
 Mr.  Ramsay remarks that two of the Australian cuckoos, when they lay their  eggs in an open nest, manifest a decided preference for nests containing  eggs similar in colour to their own.
 The European species apparently  manifests some tendency towards a similar instinct, but not rarely  departs from it, as is shown by her laying her dull and pale-coloured  eggs in the nest of the hedge-warbler with bright greenish-blue eggs.
  Had our cuckoo invariably displayed the above instinct, it would  assuredly have been added to those which it is assumed must all have  been acquired together.
 The eggs of the Australian bronze cuckoo vary,  according to Mr. Ramsay, to an extraordinary degree in colour; so  that in this respect, as well as in size, natural selection might have  secured and fixed any advantageous variation.
    In the case of the European cuckoo, the offspring of the foster-parents  are commonly ejected from the nest within three days after the cuckoo is  hatched; and as the latter at this age is in a most helpless condition,  Mr. Gould was formerly inclined to believe that the act of ejection was  performed by the foster-parents themselves.
 But he has now received a  trustworthy account of a young cuckoo which was actually seen, while  still blind and not able even to hold up its own head, in the act of  ejecting its foster-brothers.
 One of these was replaced in the nest by  the observer, and was again thrown out.
 With respect to the means by  which this strange and odious instinct was acquired, if it were of great  importance for the young cuckoo, as is probably the case, to receive as  much food as possible soon after birth, I can see no special difficulty  in its having gradually acquired, during successive generations, the  blind desire, the strength, and structure necessary for the work of  ejection; for those cuckoos which had such habits and structure best  developed would be the most securely reared.
 The first step towards the  acquisition of the proper instinct might have been mere unintentional  restlessness on the part of the young bird, when somewhat advanced  in age and strength; the habit having been afterwards improved, and  transmitted to an earlier age.
 I can see no more difficulty in this than  in the unhatched young of other birds acquiring the instinct to break  through their own shells; or than in young snakes acquiring in their  upper jaws, as Owen has remarked, a transitory sharp tooth for cutting  through the tough egg-shell.
 For if each part is liable to individual  variations at all ages, and the variations tend to be inherited at  a corresponding or earlier age--propositions which cannot be  disputed--then the instincts and structure of the young could be slowly  modified as surely as those of the adult; and both cases must stand or  fall together with the whole theory of natural selection.
    Some species of Molothrus, a widely distinct genus of American birds,  allied to our starlings, have parasitic habits like those of the cuckoo;  and the species present an interesting gradation in the perfection  of their instincts.
 The sexes of Molothrus badius are stated by an  excellent observer, Mr. Hudson, sometimes to live promiscuously together  in flocks, and sometimes to pair.
 They either build a nest of their own  or seize on one belonging to some other bird, occasionally throwing out  the nestlings of the stranger.
 They either lay their eggs in the nest  thus appropriated, or oddly enough build one for themselves on the top  of it.
 They usually sit on their own eggs and rear their own young; but  Mr. Hudson says it is probable that they are occasionally parasitic, for  he has seen the young of this species following old birds of a distinct  kind and clamouring to be fed by them.
 The parasitic habits of another  species of Molothrus, the M.
 bonariensis, are much more highly developed  than those of the last, but are still far from perfect.
 This bird, as  far as it is known, invariably lays its eggs in the nests of strangers;  but it is remarkable that several together sometimes commence to build  an irregular untidy nest of their own, placed in singular ill-adapted  situations, as on the leaves of a large thistle.
 They never, however, as  far as Mr. Hudson has ascertained, complete a nest for themselves.
 They  often lay so many eggs--from fifteen to twenty--in the same foster-nest,  that few or none can possibly be hatched.
 They have, moreover, the  extraordinary habit of pecking holes in the eggs, whether of their own  species or of their foster parents, which they find in the appropriated  nests.
 They drop also many eggs on the bare ground, which are thus  wasted.
 A third species, the M.
 pecoris of North America, has acquired  instincts as perfect as those of the cuckoo, for it never lays more than  one egg in a foster-nest, so that the young bird is securely reared.
 Mr.  Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been  so much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus bonariensis  that he quotes my words, and asks, "Must we consider these habits, not  as especially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of  one general law, namely, transition?"    Various birds, as has already been remarked, occasionally lay their eggs  in the nests of other birds.
 This habit is not very uncommon with the  Gallinaceae, and throws some light on the singular instinct of the  ostrich.
 In this family several hen birds unite and lay first a few eggs  in one nest and then in another; and these are hatched by the males.
  This instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the hens  laying a large number of eggs, but, as with the cuckoo, at intervals of  two or three days.
 The instinct, however, of the American ostrich, as  in the case of the Molothrus bonariensis, has not as yet been perfected;  for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so that in  one day's hunting I picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs.
    Many bees are parasitic, and regularly lay their eggs in the nests  of other kinds of bees.
 This case is more remarkable than that of the  cuckoo; for these bees have not only had their instincts but their  structure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits; for they  do not possess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would have been  indispensable if they had stored up food for their own young.
 Some  species of Sphegidae (wasp-like insects) are likewise parasitic; and  M.
 Fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that, although  the Tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with  paralysed prey for its own larvae, yet that, when this insect finds a  burrow already made and stored by another sphex, it takes advantage of  the prize, and becomes for the occasion parasitic.
 In this case, as  with that of the Molothrus or cuckoo, I can see no difficulty in natural  selection making an occasional habit permanent, if of advantage to the  species, and if the insect whose nest and stored food are feloniously  appropriated, be not thus exterminated.
    SLAVE-MAKING INSTINCT.
    This remarkable instinct was first discovered in the Formica (Polyerges)  rufescens by Pierre Huber, a better observer even than his celebrated  father.
 This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves; without their  aid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single year.
 The  males and fertile females do no work of any kind, and the workers or  sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing  slaves, do no other work.
 They are incapable of making their own nests,  or of feeding their own larvae.
 When the old nest is found inconvenient,  and they have to migrate, it is the slaves which determine the  migration, and actually carry their masters in their jaws.
 So utterly  helpless are the masters, that when Huber shut up thirty of them without  a slave, but with plenty of the food which they like best, and with  their larvae and pupae to stimulate them to work, they did nothing; they  could not even feed themselves, and many perished of hunger.
 Huber then  introduced a single slave (F.
 fusca), and she instantly set to work, fed  and saved the survivors; made some cells and tended the larvae, and  put all to rights.
 What can be more extraordinary than these  well-ascertained facts? If we had not known of any other slave-making  ant, it would have been hopeless to speculate how so wonderful an  instinct could have been perfected.
    Another species, Formica sanguinea, was likewise first discovered by P.
  Huber to be a slave-making ant.
 This species is found in the southern  parts of England, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F.
 Smith,  of the British Museum, to whom I am much indebted for information on  this and other subjects.
 Although fully trusting to the statements of  Huber and Mr. Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical  frame of mind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the existence  of so extraordinary an instinct as that of making slaves.
 Hence, I  will give the observations which I made in some little detail.
 I opened  fourteen nests of F.
 sanguinea, and found a few slaves in all.
 Males and  fertile females of the slave-species (F.
 fusca) are found only in their  own proper communities, and have never been observed in the nests of F.
  sanguinea.
 The slaves are black and not above half the size of their  red masters, so that the contrast in their appearance is great.
 When the  nest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come out, and like  their masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when the nest is  much disturbed, and the larvae and pupae are exposed, the slaves work  energetically together with their masters in carrying them away to a  place of safety.
 Hence, it is clear that the slaves feel quite at home.
  During the months of June and July, on three successive years, I watched  for many hours several nests in Surrey and Sussex, and never saw a slave  either leave or enter a nest.
 As, during these months, the slaves are  very few in number, I thought that they might behave differently when  more numerous; but Mr. Smith informs me that he has watched the nests at  various hours during May, June and August, both in Surrey and Hampshire,  and has never seen the slaves, though present in large numbers in  August, either leave or enter the nest.
 Hence, he considers them as  strictly household slaves.
 The masters, on the other hand, may be  constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and food of all  kinds.
 During the year 1860, however, in the month of July, I came  across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves, and I  observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest, and  marching along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir tree, twenty-five  yards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of  aphides or cocci.
 According to Huber, who had ample opportunities  for observation, the slaves in Switzerland habitually work with their  masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in  the morning and evening; and, as Huber expressly states, their principal  office is to search for aphides.
 This difference in the usual habits of  the masters and slaves in the two countries, probably depends merely  on the slaves being captured in greater numbers in Switzerland than in  England.
    One day I fortunately witnessed a migration of F.
 sanguinea from one  nest to another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the  masters carefully carrying their slaves in their jaws instead of  being carried by them, as in the case of F.
 rufescens.
 Another day my  attention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the  same spot, and evidently not in search of food; they approached and were  vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species (F.
  fusca); sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of  the slave-making F.
 sanguinea.
 The latter ruthlessly killed their  small opponents and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest,  twenty-nine yards distant; but they were prevented from getting any  pupae to rear as slaves.
 I then dug up a small parcel of the pupae of F.
  fusca from another nest, and put them down on a bare spot near the place  of combat; they were eagerly seized and carried off by the tyrants, who  perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been victorious in their late  combat.
    At the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupae of  another species, F.
 flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still  clinging to the fragments of their nest.
 This species is sometimes,  though rarely, made into slaves, as has been described by Mr. Smith.
  Although so small a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it  ferociously attack other ants.
 In one instance I found to my surprise  an independent community of F.
 flava under a stone beneath a nest of the  slave-making F.
 sanguinea; and when I had accidentally disturbed both  nests, the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising  courage.
 Now I was curious to ascertain whether F.
 sanguinea could  distinguish the pupae of F.
 fusca, which they habitually make into  slaves, from those of the little and furious F.
 flava, which they rarely  capture, and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them;  for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupae of F.
  fusca, whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupae,  or even the earth from the nest, of F.
 flava, and quickly ran away; but  in about a quarter of an hour, shortly after all the little yellow ants  had crawled away, they took heart and carried off the pupae.
    One evening I visited another community of F.
 sanguinea, and found a  number of these ants returning home and entering their nests, carrying  the dead bodies of F.
 fusca (showing that it was not a migration) and  numerous pupae.
 I traced a long file of ants burdened with booty, for  about forty yards back, to a very thick clump of heath, whence I saw the  last individual of F.
 sanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but I was not  able to find the desolated nest in the thick heath.
 The nest, however,  must have been close at hand, for two or three individuals of F.
 fusca  were rushing about in the greatest agitation, and one was perched  motionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of  heath, an image of despair over its ravaged home.
    Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in  regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves.
 Let it be observed  what a contrast the instinctive habits of F.
 sanguinea present with  those of the continental F.
 rufescens.
 The latter does not build its own  nest, does not determine its own migrations, does not collect food  for itself or its young, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely  dependent on its numerous slaves.
 Formica sanguinea, on the other  hand, possesses much fewer slaves, and in the early part of the summer  extremely few.
 The masters determine when and where a new nest shall  be formed, and when they migrate, the masters carry the slaves.
 Both in  Switzerland and England the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of  the larvae, and the masters alone go on slave-making expeditions.
 In  Switzerland the slaves and masters work together, making and bringing  materials for the nest: both, but chiefly the slaves, tend and milk  as it may be called, their aphides; and thus both collect food for  the community.
 In England the masters alone usually leave the nest to  collect building materials and food for themselves, their slaves and  larvae.
 So that the masters in this country receive much less service  from their slaves than they do in Switzerland.
    By what steps the instinct of F.
 sanguinea originated I will not pretend  to conjecture.
 But as ants which are not slave-makers, will, as I have  seen, carry off pupae of other species, if scattered near their nests,  it is possible that such pupae originally stored as food might become  developed; and the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared would then  follow their proper instincts, and do what work they could.
 If their  presence proved useful to the species which had seized them--if it were  more advantageous to this species, to capture workers than to procreate  them--the habit of collecting pupae, originally for food, might by  natural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the  very different purpose of raising slaves.
 When the instinct was once  acquired, if carried out to a much less extent even than in our British  F.
 sanguinea, which, as we have seen, is less aided by its slaves than  the same species in Switzerland, natural selection might increase and  modify the instinct--always supposing each modification to be of use to  the species--until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves  as is the Formica rufescens.
    CELL-MAKING INSTINCT OF THE HIVE-BEE.
    I will not here enter on minute details on this subject, but will merely  give an outline of the conclusions at which I have arrived.
 He must be  a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb, so  beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration.
 We  hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite  problem, and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the  greatest possible amount of honey, with the least possible consumption  of precious wax in their construction.
 It has been remarked that a  skilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would find it very  difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this is effected  by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive.
 Granting whatever instincts  you please, it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make  all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive when they are  correctly made.
 But the difficulty is not nearly so great as at first  appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, I think, to follow from a  few simple instincts.
    I was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has shown  that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of  adjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only  as a modification of his theory.
 Let us look to the great principle of  gradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of  work.
 At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their  old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax,  and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax.
 At  the other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in  a double layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism,  with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join an inverted  pyramid, of three rhombs.
 These rhombs have certain angles, and the  three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the  comb, enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells  on the opposite side.
 In the series between the extreme perfection of  the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee,  we have the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, carefully described  and figured by Pierre Huber.
 The Melipona itself is intermediate in  structure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to  the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells,  in which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of  wax for holding honey.
 These latter cells are nearly spherical and of  nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass.
 But the  important point to notice is, that these cells are always made at that  degree of nearness to each other that they would have intersected or  broken into each other if the spheres had been completed; but this is  never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between  the spheres which thus tend to intersect.
 Hence, each cell consists of  an outer spherical portion, and of two, three, or more flat surfaces,  according as the cell adjoins two, three or more other cells.
 When one  cell rests on three other cells, which, from the spheres being nearly  of the same size, is very frequently and necessarily the case, the three  flat surfaces are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as Huber has  remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal  base of the cell of the hive-bee.
 As in the cells of the hive-bee, so  here, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into  the construction of three adjoining cells.
 It is obvious that the  Melipona saves wax, and what is more important, labour, by this manner  of building; for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not  double, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions,  and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells.
    Reflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made  its spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of  equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer,  the resulting structure would have been as perfect as the comb of the  hive-bee.
 Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge, and  this geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up  from his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:--    If a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in  two parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of  radius x sqrt(2) or radius x 1.
41421 (or at some lesser distance), from  the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer; and at the  same distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and  parallel layer; then, if planes of intersection between the several  spheres in both layers be formed, there will result a double layer of  hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three  rhombs; and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have  every angle identically the same with the best measurements which have  been made of the cells of the hive-bee.
 But I hear from Professor Wyman,  who has made numerous careful measurements, that the accuracy of the  workmanship of the bee has been greatly exaggerated; so much so, that  whatever the typical form of the cell may be, it is rarely, if ever,  realised.
    Hence we may safely conclude that, if we could slightly modify the  instincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very  wonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as  that of the hive-bee.
 We must suppose the Melipona to have the power of  forming her cells truly spherical, and of equal sizes; and this would  not be very surprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain  extent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows many insects make  in wood, apparently by turning round on a fixed point.
 We must suppose  the Melipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does  her cylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the  greatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what  distance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making  their spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance,  that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect to a certain  extent; and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat  surfaces.
 By such modifications of instincts which in themselves are not  very wonderful--hardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to  make its nest--I believe that the hive-bee has acquired, through natural  selection, her inimitable architectural powers.
    But this theory can be tested by experiment.
 Following the example of  Mr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long,  thick, rectangular strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate  minute circular pits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they  made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins,  appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of  about the diameter of a cell.
 It was most interesting to observe that,  wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together,  they had begun their work at such a distance from each other that by  the time the basins had acquired the above stated width (i.
e.
 about the  width of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the  diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the  basins intersected or broke into each other.
 As soon as this occurred,  the bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax  on the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each hexagonal  prism was built upon the scalloped edge of a smooth basin, instead of on  the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary  cells.
    I then put into the hive, instead of a thick, rectangular piece of wax,  a thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion.
 The bees  instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each  other, in the same way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that  the bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth  as in the former experiment, would have broken into each other from the  opposite sides.
 The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and  they stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon  as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bases; and these  flat bases, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax left  ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along  the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite  side of the ridge of wax.
 In some parts, only small portions, in other  parts, large portions of a rhombic plate were thus left between the  opposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural state of things, had  not been neatly performed.
 The bees must have worked at very nearly the  same rate in circularly gnawing away and deepening the basins on both  sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, in order to have thus succeeded in  leaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work at the planes  of intersection.
    Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any  difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip  of wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper  thinness, and then stopping their work.
 In ordinary combs it has  appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly  the same rate from the opposite sides; for I have noticed half-completed  rhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were slightly concave  on one side, where I suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly,  and convex on the opposed side where the bees had worked less quickly.
  In one well-marked instance, I put the comb back into the hive, and  allowed the bees to go on working for a short time, and again examined  the cell, and I found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had  become PERFECTLY FLAT: it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme  thinness of the little plate, that they could have effected this by  gnawing away the convex side; and I suspect that the bees in such cases  stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax  (which as I have tried is easily done) into its proper intermediate  plane, and thus flatten it.
    From the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can see that, if  the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could  make their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper distance  from each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by endeavouring to  make equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the spheres to break  into each other.
 Now bees, as may be clearly seen by examining the edge  of a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential wall or rim all  round the comb; and they gnaw this away from the opposite sides, always  working circularly as they deepen each cell.
 They do not make the whole  three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only  that one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or  the two plates, as the case may be; and they never complete the upper  edges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal walls are commenced.
  Some of these statements differ from those made by the justly celebrated  elder Huber, but I am convinced of their accuracy; and if I had space, I  could show that they are conformable with my theory.
    Huber's statement, that the very first cell is excavated out of a little  parallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen, strictly  correct; the first commencement having always been a little hood of  wax; but I will not here enter on details.
 We see how important a part  excavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a  great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax  in the proper position--that is, along the plane of intersection between  two adjoining spheres.
 I have several specimens showing clearly that  they can do this.
 Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax  round a growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding  in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells.
  But the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being  largely gnawed away on both sides.
 The manner in which the bees build is  curious; they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times  thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will  ultimately be left.
 We shall understand how they work, by supposing  masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin  cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth,  very thin wall is left in the middle; the masons always piling up the  cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement on the summit of the ridge.
 We  shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward but always crowned  by a gigantic coping.
 From all the cells, both those just commenced and  those completed, being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the  bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate  hexagonal walls.
 These walls, as Professor Miller has kindly ascertained  for me, vary greatly in thickness; being, on an average of twelve  measurements made near the border of the comb, 1/352 of an inch in  thickness; whereas the basal rhomboidal plates are thicker, nearly in  the proportion of three to two, having a mean thickness, from twenty-one  measurements, of 1/229 of an inch.
 By the above singular manner of  building, strength is continually given to the comb, with the utmost  ultimate economy of wax.
    It seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the  cells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee  after working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as  Huber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement  of the first cell.
 I was able practically to show this fact, by covering  the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin  of the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin  layer of melted vermilion wax; and I invariably found that the colour  was most delicately diffused by the bees--as delicately as a painter  could have done it with his brush--by atoms of the coloured wax having  been taken from the spot on which it had been placed, and worked into  the growing edges of the cells all round.
 The work of construction seems  to be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively  standing at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to  sweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the  planes of intersection between these spheres.
 It was really curious to  note in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle,  how often the bees would pull down and rebuild in different ways the  same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first  rejected.
    When bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions  for working--for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the  middle of a comb growing downwards, so that the comb has to be built  over one face of the slip--in this case the bees can lay the foundations  of one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting  beyond the other completed cells.
 It suffices that the bees should be  enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other  and from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by striking  imaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate between two  adjoining spheres; but, as far as I have seen, they never gnaw away and  finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and  of the adjoining cells has been built.
 This capacity in bees of laying  down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place  between two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a fact,  which seems at first subversive of the foregoing theory; namely, that  the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are sometimes strictly  hexagonal; but I have not space here to enter on this subject.
 Nor does  there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect (as in the case  of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if she were to work alternately  on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same  time, always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts  of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and building up  intermediate planes.
    As natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight  modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the  individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how  a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts,  all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could  have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? I think the answer is not  difficult: cells constructed like those of the bee or the wasp gain in  strength, and save much in labour and space, and in the materials of  which they are constructed.
 With respect to the formation of wax, it is  known that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and  I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been experimentally proved  that from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a  hive of bees for the secretion of a pound of wax; so that a prodigious  quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in  a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction  of their combs.
 Moreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days  during the process of secretion.
 A large store of honey is indispensable  to support a large stock of bees during the winter; and the security  of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being  supported.
 Hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey, and the  time consumed in collecting the honey, must be an important element of  success any family of bees.
 Of course the success of the species may  be dependent on the number of its enemies, or parasites, or on quite  distinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of  honey which the bees can collect.
 But let us suppose that this latter  circumstance determined, as it probably often has determined, whether  a bee allied to our humble-bees could exist in large numbers in any  country; and let us further suppose that the community lived through the  winter, and consequently required a store of honey: there can in  this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our imaginary  humble-bee if a slight modification of her instincts led her to make her  waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in  common even to two adjoining cells would save some little labour and  wax.
 Hence, it would continually be more and more advantageous to our  humble-bees, if they were to make their cells more and more regular,  nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the  Melipona; for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each  cell would serve to bound the adjoining cells, and much labour and wax  would be saved.
 Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to  the Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more  regular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the  spherical surfaces would wholly disappear and be replaced by plane  surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of  the hive-bee.
 Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural  selection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can  see, is absolutely perfect in economising labour and wax.
    Thus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that  of the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken  advantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler  instincts; natural selection having, by slow degrees, more and more  perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from  each other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along  the planes of intersection.
 The bees, of course, no more knowing that  they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other,  than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and  of the basal rhombic plates; the motive power of the process of natural  selection having been the construction of cells of due strength and of  the proper size and shape for the larvae, this being effected with the  greatest possible economy of labour and wax; that individual swarm which  thus made the best cells with least labour, and least waste of honey  in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having transmitted  their newly-acquired economical instincts to new swarms, which in their  turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for  existence.
    OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION AS APPLIED TO INSTINCTS:  NEUTER AND STERILE INSECTS.
    It has been objected to the foregoing view of the origin of instincts  that "the variations of structure and of instinct must have been  simultaneous and accurately adjusted to each other, as a modification  in the one without an immediate corresponding change in the other would  have been fatal.
" The force of this objection rests entirely on the  assumption that the changes in the instincts and structure are abrupt.
  To take as an illustration the case of the larger titmouse, (Parus  major) alluded to in a previous chapter; this bird often holds the seeds  of the yew between its feet on a branch, and hammers with its beak till  it gets at the kernel.
 Now what special difficulty would there be in  natural selection preserving all the slight individual variations in the  shape of the beak, which were better and better adapted to break open  the seeds, until a beak was formed, as well constructed for this purpose  as that of the nuthatch, at the same time that habit, or compulsion, or  spontaneous variations of taste, led the bird to become more and more of  a seed-eater? In this case the beak is supposed to be slowly modified  by natural selection, subsequently to, but in accordance with, slowly  changing habits or taste; but let the feet of the titmouse vary and grow  larger from correlation with the beak, or from any other unknown cause,  and it is not improbable that such larger feet would lead the bird to  climb more and more until it acquired the remarkable climbing instinct  and power of the nuthatch.
 In this case a gradual change of structure is  supposed to lead to changed instinctive habits.
 To take one more case:  few instincts are more remarkable than that which leads the swift of  the Eastern Islands to make its nest wholly of inspissated saliva.
 Some  birds build their nests of mud, believed to be moistened with saliva;  and one of the swifts of North America makes its nest (as I have  seen) of sticks agglutinated with saliva, and even with flakes of this  substance.
 Is it then very improbable that the natural selection of  individual swifts, which secreted more and more saliva, should at last  produce a species with instincts leading it to neglect other materials  and to make its nest exclusively of inspissated saliva? And so in other  cases.
 It must, however, be admitted that in many instances we cannot  conjecture whether it was instinct or structure which first varied.
    No doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed  to the theory of natural selection--cases, in which we cannot see how  an instinct could have originated; cases, in which no intermediate  gradations are known to exist; cases of instincts of such trifling  importance, that they could hardly have been acted on by natural  selection; cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals  so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their  similarity by inheritance from a common progenitor, and consequently  must believe that they were independently acquired through natural  selection.
 I will not here enter on these several cases, but will  confine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared to  me insuperable, and actually fatal to the whole theory.
 I allude to  the neuters or sterile females in insect communities: for these neuters  often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males  and fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate  their kind.
    The subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I will  here take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants.
 How the  workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater  than that of any other striking modification of structure; for it can  be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of  nature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had been social,  and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have  been annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I can  see no especial difficulty in this having been effected through natural  selection.
 But I must pass over this preliminary difficulty.
 The great  difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males  and the fertile females in structure, as in the shape of the thorax, and  in being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes, and in instinct.
 As  far as instinct alone is concerned, the wonderful difference in this  respect between the workers and the perfect females would have been  better exemplified by the hive-bee.
 If a working ant or other neuter  insect had been an ordinary animal, I should have unhesitatingly  assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through  natural selection; namely, by individuals having been born with slight  profitable modifications, which were inherited by the offspring, and  that these again varied and again were selected, and so onwards.
 But  with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its  parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never have transmitted  successively acquired modifications of structure or instinct to its  progeny.
 It may well be asked how it is possible to reconcile this case  with the theory of natural selection?    First, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in  our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts  of differences of inherited structure which are correlated with certain  ages and with either sex.
 We have differences correlated not only with  one sex, but with that short period when the reproductive system is  active, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws  of the male salmon.
 We have even slight differences in the horns of  different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect  state of the male sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than  the oxen of other breeds, relatively to the length of the horns in  both the bulls and cows of these same breeds.
 Hence, I can see no  great difficulty in any character becoming correlated with the sterile  condition of certain members of insect communities; the difficulty lies  in understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could  have been slowly accumulated by natural selection.
    This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I  believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied  to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the  desired end.
 Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well  marbled together.
 An animal thus characterized has been slaughtered,  but the breeder has gone with confidence to the same stock and has  succeeded.
 Such faith may be placed in the power of selection that a  breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns,  could, it is probable, be formed by carefully watching which individual  bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and  yet no one ox would ever have propagated its kind.
 Here is a better and  real illustration: According to M.
 Verlot, some varieties of the double  annual stock, from having been long and carefully selected to the right  degree, always produce a large proportion of seedlings bearing double  and quite sterile flowers, but they likewise yield some single and  fertile plants.
 These latter, by which alone the variety can be  propagated, may be compared with the fertile male and female ants, and  the double sterile plants with the neuters of the same community.
 As  with the varieties of the stock, so with social insects, selection has  been applied to the family, and not to the individual, for the sake  of gaining a serviceable end.
 Hence, we may conclude that slight  modifications of structure or of instinct, correlated with the sterile  condition of certain members of the community, have proved advantageous;  consequently the fertile males and females have flourished, and  transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile  members with the same modifications.
 This process must have been  repeated many times, until that prodigious amount of difference between  the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced  which we see in many social insects.
    But we have not as yet touched on the acme of the difficulty; namely,  the fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the  fertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost  incredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes.
  The castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are  perfectly well defined; being as distinct from each other as are any  two species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the same  family.
 Thus, in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with  jaws and instincts extraordinarily different: in Cryptocerus, the  workers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their  heads, the use of which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus,  the workers of one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the  workers of another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen  which secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted  by the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our  European ants guard and imprison.
    It will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the  principle of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful  and well-established facts at once annihilate the theory.
 In the simpler  case of neuter insects all of one caste, which, as I believe, have been  rendered different from the fertile males and females through natural  selection, we may conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that  the successive, slight, profitable modifications did not first arise in  all the neuters in the same nest, but in some few alone; and that by  the survival of the communities with females which produced most neuters  having the advantageous modification, all the neuters ultimately came to  be thus characterized.
 According to this view we ought occasionally  to find in the same nest neuter-insects, presenting gradations of  structure; and this we do find, even not rarely, considering how few  neuter-insects out of Europe have been carefully examined.
 Mr. F.
 Smith  has shown that the neuters of several British ants differ surprisingly  from each other in size and sometimes in colour; and that the extreme  forms can be linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest:  I have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind.
 It sometimes  happens that the larger or the smaller sized workers are the most  numerous; or that both large and small are numerous, while those of an  intermediate size are scanty in numbers.
 Formica flava has larger  and smaller workers, with some few of intermediate size; and, in this  species, as Mr. F.
 Smith has observed, the larger workers have simple  eyes (ocelli), which, though small, can be plainly distinguished,  whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli rudimentary.
 Having  carefully dissected several specimens of these workers, I can affirm  that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can  be accounted for merely by their proportionately lesser size; and I  fully believe, though I dare not assert so positively, that the workers  of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate  condition.
 So that here we have two bodies of sterile workers in the  same nest, differing not only in size, but in their organs of vision,  yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition.
 I may  digress by adding, that if the smaller workers had been the most useful  to the community, and those males and females had been continually  selected, which produced more and more of the smaller workers, until all  the workers were in this condition; we should then have had a species of  ant with neuters in nearly the same condition as those of Myrmica.
 For  the workers of Myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli, though the  male and female ants of this genus have well-developed ocelli.
    I may give one other case: so confidently did I expect occasionally to  find gradations of important structures between the different castes  of neuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F.
  Smith's offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver  ant (Anomma) of West Africa.
 The reader will perhaps best appreciate  the amount of difference in these workers by my giving, not the actual  measurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference was  the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house, of whom  many were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we  must in addition suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead  of three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five  times as big.
 The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several  sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and number of the  teeth.
 But the important fact for us is that, though the workers can  be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly  into each other, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws.
 I  speak confidently on this latter point, as Sir J.
 Lubbock made drawings  for me, with the camera lucida, of the jaws which I dissected from the  workers of the several sizes.
 Mr. Bates, in his interesting "Naturalist  on the Amazons," has described analogous cases.
    With these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting  on the fertile ants or parents, could form a species which should  regularly produce neuters, all of large size with one form of jaw, or  all of small size with widely different jaws; or lastly, and this is the  greatest difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure, and  simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure;  a graduated series having first been formed, as in the case of the  driver ant, and then the extreme forms having been produced in greater  and greater numbers, through the survival of the parents which generated  them, until none with an intermediate structure were produced.
    An analogous explanation has been given by Mr. Wallace, of the equally  complex case, of certain Malayan butterflies regularly appearing under  two or even three distinct female forms; and by Fritz Muller, of certain  Brazilian crustaceans likewise appearing under two widely distinct male  forms.
 But this subject need not here be discussed.
    I have now explained how, I believe, the wonderful fact of two  distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same  nest, both widely different from each other and from their parents, has  originated.
 We can see how useful their production may have been to a  social community of ants, on the same principle that the division of  labour is useful to civilised man.
 Ants, however, work by inherited  instincts and by inherited organs or tools, while man works by acquired  knowledge and manufactured instruments.
 But I must confess, that, with  all my faith in natural selection, I should never have anticipated that  this principle could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not  the case of these neuter insects led me to this conclusion.
 I have,  therefore, discussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient  length, in order to show the power of natural selection, and likewise  because this is by far the most serious special difficulty which my  theory has encountered.
 The case, also, is very interesting, as it  proves that with animals, as with plants, any amount of modification  may be effected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, spontaneous  variations, which are in any way profitable, without exercise or habit  having been brought into play.
 For peculiar habits, confined to the  workers of sterile females, however long they might be followed, could  not possibly affect the males and fertile females, which alone leave  descendants.
 I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative  case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of inherited  habit, as advanced by Lamarck.
    SUMMARY.
    I have endeavoured in this chapter briefly to show that the mental  qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations are  inherited.
 Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts  vary slightly in a state of nature.
 No one will dispute that instincts  are of the highest importance to each animal.
 Therefore, there is no  real difficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection  accumulating to any extent slight modifications of instinct which are in  any way useful.
 In many cases habit or use and disuse have probably  come into play.
 I do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter  strengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of  difficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it.
 On the other  hand, the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are  liable to mistakes; that no instinct can be shown to have been produced  for the good of other animals, though animals take advantage of the  instincts of others; that the canon in natural history, of "Natura  non facit saltum," is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal  structure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is  otherwise inexplicable--all tend to corroborate the theory of natural  selection.
    This theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regard  to instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but distinct,  species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under  considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly  the same instincts.
 For instance, we can understand, on the principle of  inheritance, how it is that the thrush of tropical South America lines  its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British  thrush; how it is that the Hornbills of Africa and India have the same  extraordinary instinct of plastering up and imprisoning the females in a  hole in a tree, with only a small hole left in the plaster through which  the males feed them and their young when hatched; how it is that the  male wrens (Troglodytes) of North America, build "cock-nests," to roost  in, like the males of our Kitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that of  any other known bird.
 Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to  my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as  the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, ants making slaves, the  larvae of ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,  not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences  of one general law leading to the advancement of all organic  beings--namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest  die.

 HYBRIDISM.
     Distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of   hybrids--Sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by close   interbreeding, removed by domestication--Laws governing the sterility   of hybrids--Sterility not a special endowment, but incidental on   other differences, not accumulated by natural selection--Causes of   the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids--Parallelism between the   effects of changed conditions of life and of crossing--Dimorphism and   trimorphism--Fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel   offspring not universal--Hybrids and mongrels compared independently of   their fertility--Summary.
      The view commonly entertained by naturalists is that species, when  intercrossed, have been specially endowed with sterility, in order  to prevent their confusion.
 This view certainly seems at first highly  probable, for species living together could hardly have been kept  distinct had they been capable of freely crossing.
 The subject is in  many ways important for us, more especially as the sterility of species  when first crossed, and that of their hybrid offspring, cannot have been  acquired, as I shall show, by the preservation of successive profitable  degrees of sterility.
 It is an incidental result of differences in the  reproductive systems of the parent-species.
    In treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent  fundamentally different, have generally been confounded; namely, the  sterility of species when first crossed, and the sterility of the  hybrids produced from them.
    Pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect  condition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no  offspring.
 Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs  functionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the  male element in both plants and animals; though the formative organs  themselves are perfect in structure, as far as the microscope reveals.
  In the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo  are perfect; in the second case they are either not at all developed, or  are imperfectly developed.
 This distinction is important, when the  cause of the sterility, which is common to the two cases, has to be  considered.
 The distinction probably has been slurred over, owing to the  sterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment, beyond  the province of our reasoning powers.
    The fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed to be  descended from common parents, when crossed, and likewise the fertility  of their mongrel offspring, is, with reference to my theory, of equal  importance with the sterility of species; for it seems to make a broad  and clear distinction between varieties and species.
    DEGREES OF STERILITY.
    First, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid  offspring.
 It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of  those two conscientious and admirable observers, Kolreuter and Gartner,  who almost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply  impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility.
  Kolreuter makes the rule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in  ten cases in which he found two forms, considered by most authors as  distinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them  as varieties.
 Gartner, also, makes the rule equally universal; and he  disputes the entire fertility of Kolreuter's ten cases.
 But in these and  in many other cases, Gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in  order to show that there is any degree of sterility.
 He always compares  the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when first crossed,  and the maximum produced by their hybrid offspring, with the average  number produced by both pure parent-species in a state of nature.
 But  causes of serious error here intervene: a plant, to be hybridised, must  be castrated, and, what is often more important, must be secluded  in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other  plants.
 Nearly all the plants experimented on by Gartner were potted,  and were kept in a chamber in his house.
 That these processes are often  injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted; for Gartner  gives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated,  and artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and (excluding  all cases such as the Leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged  difficulty in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their  fertility in some degree impaired.
 Moreover, as Gartner repeatedly  crossed some forms, such as the common red and blue pimpernels  (Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank as  varieties, and found them absolutely sterile, we may doubt whether many  species are really so sterile, when intercrossed, as he believed.
    It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species  when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly,  and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily  affected by various circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is  most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins.
  I think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two  most experienced observers who have ever lived, namely Kolreuter and  Gartner, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to some  of the very same forms.
 It is also most instructive to compare--but I  have not space here to enter on details--the evidence advanced by our  best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be  ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced  by different hybridisers, or by the same observer from experiments made  during different years.
 It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor  fertility affords any certain distinction between species and varieties.
  The evidence from this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the  same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and  structural differences.
    In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though  Gartner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a  cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for  ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never  increases, but generally decreases greatly and suddenly.
 With respect  to this decrease, it may first be noticed that when any deviation in  structure or constitution is common to both parents, this is often  transmitted in an augmented degree to the offspring; and both sexual  elements in hybrid plants are already affected in some degree.
 But I  believe that their fertility has been diminished in nearly all these  cases by an independent cause, namely, by too close interbreeding.
 I  have made so many experiments and collected so many facts, showing on  the one hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or  variety increases the vigour and fertility of the offspring, and on  the other hand that very close interbreeding lessens their vigour and  fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this conclusion.
  Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as  the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same  garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the  flowering season: hence hybrids, if left to themselves, will generally  be fertilised during each generation by pollen from the same flower; and  this would probably be injurious to their fertility, already lessened  by their hybrid origin.
 I am strengthened in this conviction by a  remarkable statement repeatedly made by Gartner, namely, that if even  the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen  of the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill  effects from manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on  increasing.
 Now, in the process of artificial fertilisation, pollen is  as often taken by chance (as I know from my own experience) from the  anthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself  which is to be fertilised; so that a cross between two flowers, though  probably often on the same plant, would be thus effected.
 Moreover,  whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an observer  as Gartner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have insured  in each generation a cross with pollen from a distinct flower, either  from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature.
  And thus, the strange fact of an increase of fertility in the successive  generations of ARTIFICIALLY FERTILISED hybrids, in contrast with those  spontaneously self-fertilised, may, as I believe, be accounted for by  too close interbreeding having been avoided.
    Now let us turn to the results arrived at by a third most experienced  hybridiser, namely, the Hon.
 and Rev.
 W.
 Herbert.
 He is as emphatic in  his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile--as fertile as  the pure parent-species--as are Kolreuter and Gartner that some degree  of sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature.
  He experimented on some of the very same species as did Gartner.
 The  difference in their results may, I think, be in part accounted for by  Herbert's great horticultural skill, and by his having hot-houses at his  command.
 Of his many important statements I will here give only a single  one as an example, namely, that "every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense  fertilised by C.
 revolutum produced a plant, which I never saw to occur  in a case of its natural fecundation.
" So that here we have perfect, or  even more than commonly perfect fertility, in a first cross between two  distinct species.
    This case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a singular fact, namely,  that individual plants of certain species of Lobelia, Verbascum and  Passiflora, can easily be fertilised by the pollen from a distinct  species, but not by pollen from the same plant, though this pollen can  be proved to be perfectly sound by fertilising other plants or species.
  In the genus Hippeastrum, in Corydalis as shown by Professor Hildebrand,  in various orchids as shown by Mr. Scott and Fritz Muller, all the  individuals are in this peculiar condition.
 So that with some species,  certain abnormal individuals, and in other species all the individuals,  can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be fertilised  by pollen from the same individual plant! To give one instance, a bulb  of Hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers; three were fertilised  by Herbert with their own pollen, and the fourth was subsequently  fertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended from three  distinct species: the result was that "the ovaries of the three first  flowers soon ceased to grow, and after a few days perished entirely,  whereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous  growth and rapid progress to maturity, and bore good seed, which  vegetated freely.
" Mr. Herbert tried similar experiments during many  years, and always with the same result.
 These cases serve to show on  what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of a  species sometimes depends.
    The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with  scientific precision, deserve some notice.
 It is notorious in how  complicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria,  Petunia, Rhododendron, etc.
, have been crossed, yet many of these  hybrids seed freely.
 For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from  Calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar  in general habit, "reproduces itself as perfectly as if it had been a  natural species from the mountains of Chile.
" I have taken some pains  to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of  Rhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile.
  Mr. C.
 Noble, for instance, informs me that he raises stocks for  grafting from a hybrid between Rhod.
 ponticum and catawbiense, and that  this hybrid "seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine.
" Had hybrids,  when fairly treated, always gone on decreasing in fertility in each  successive generation, as Gartner believed to be the case, the fact  would have been notorious to nurserymen.
 Horticulturists raise large  beds of the same hybrid, and such alone are fairly treated, for by  insect agency the several individuals are allowed to cross freely with  each other, and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus  prevented.
 Any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of  insect agency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of  hybrid Rhododendrons, which produce no pollen, for he will find on their  stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers.
    In regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried  than with plants.
 If our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that  is, if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as are the  genera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely distinct  in the scale of nature can be crossed more easily than in the case  of plants; but the hybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile.
 It  should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding  freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried: for  instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine distinct species of  finches, but, as not one of these breeds freely in confinement, we have  no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary,  or that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile.
 Again, with respect  to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid  animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same  hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so  as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding.
 On the contrary,  brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive  generation, in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every  breeder.
 And in this case, it is not at all surprising that the inherent  sterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing.
    Although I know of hardly any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of  perfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have reason to believe that the  hybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from Phasianus  colchicus with P.
 torquatus, are perfectly fertile.
 M.
 Quatrefages  states that the hybrids from two moths (Bombyx cynthia and arrindia)  were proved in Paris to be fertile inter se for eight generations.
 It  has lately been asserted that two such distinct species as the hare and  rabbit, when they can be got to breed together, produce offspring, which  are highly fertile when crossed with one of the parent-species.
 The  hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A.
 cygnoides), species which  are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera, have  often bred in this country with either pure parent, and in one single  instance they have bred inter se.
 This was effected by Mr. Eyton, who  raised two hybrids from the same parents, but from different hatches;  and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids  (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest.
 In India, however,  these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured by  two eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Captain Hutton, that  whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of  the country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure  parent-species exists, they must certainly be highly or perfectly  fertile.
    With our domesticated animals, the various races when crossed together  are quite fertile; yet in many cases they are descended from two or more  wild species.
 From this fact we must conclude either that the aboriginal  parent-species at first produced perfectly fertile hybrids, or that the  hybrids subsequently reared under domestication became quite fertile.
  This latter alternative, which was first propounded by Pallas, seems by  far the most probable, and can, indeed, hardly be doubted.
 It is, for  instance, almost certain that our dogs are descended from several wild  stocks; yet, with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic  dogs of South America, all are quite fertile together; but analogy makes  me greatly doubt, whether the several aboriginal species would at first  have freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids.
  So again I have lately acquired decisive evidence that the crossed  offspring from the Indian humped and common cattle are inter se  perfectly fertile; and from the observations by Rutimeyer on their  important osteological differences, as well as from those by Mr. Blyth  on their differences in habits, voice, constitution, etc.
, these two  forms must be regarded as good and distinct species.
 The same remarks  may be extended to the two chief races of the pig.
 We must, therefore,  either give up the belief of the universal sterility of species when  crossed; or we must look at this sterility in animals, not as an  indelible characteristic, but as one capable of being removed by  domestication.
    Finally, considering all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of  plants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility,  both in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely general result;  but that it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered  as absolutely universal.
    LAWS GOVERNING THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.
    We will now consider a little more in detail the laws governing the  sterility of first crosses and of hybrids.
 Our chief object will be to  see whether or not these laws indicate that species have been specially  endowed with this quality, in order to prevent their crossing and  blending together in utter confusion.
 The following conclusions are  drawn up chiefly from Gartner's admirable work on the hybridisation  of plants.
 I have taken much pains to ascertain how far they apply  to animals, and, considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to  hybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how generally the same  rules apply to both kingdoms.
    It has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of  first crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility.
  It is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown;  but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given.
 When pollen  from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a  distinct family, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic  dust.
 From this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different  species applied to the stigma of some one species of the same genus,  yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to nearly  complete or even quite complete fertility; and, as we have seen, in  certain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that  which the plant's own pollen produces.
 So in hybrids themselves, there  are some which never have produced, and probably never would produce,  even with the pollen of the pure parents, a single fertile seed: but in  some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected, by  the pollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the flower of the  hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the  early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient  fertilisation.
 From this extreme degree of sterility we have  self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds  up to perfect fertility.
    The hybrids raised from two species which are very difficult to cross,  and which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but  the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the  sterility of the hybrids thus produced--two classes of facts which are  generally confounded together--is by no means strict.
 There are many  cases, in which two pure species, as in the genus Verbascum, can be  united with unusual facility, and produce numerous hybrid offspring,  yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile.
 On the other hand, there are  species which can be crossed very rarely, or with extreme difficulty,  but the hybrids, when at last produced, are very fertile.
 Even within  the limits of the same genus, for instance in Dianthus, these two  opposite cases occur.
    The fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily  affected by unfavourable conditions, than is that of pure species.
 But  the fertility of first crosses is likewise innately variable; for it  is not always the same in degree when the same two species are crossed  under the same circumstances; it depends in part upon the constitution  of the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment.
  So it is with hybrids, for their degree of fertility is often found to  differ greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the  same capsule and exposed to the same conditions.
    By the term systematic affinity is meant, the general resemblance  between species in structure and constitution.
 Now the fertility  of first crosses, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely  governed by their systematic affinity.
 This is clearly shown by hybrids  never having been raised between species ranked by systematists in  distinct families; and on the other hand, by very closely allied  species generally uniting with facility.
 But the correspondence between  systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict.
  A multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which  will not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and on the other hand  of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility.
 In  the same family there may be a genus, as Dianthus, in which very many  species can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as Silene,  in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between  extremely close species a single hybrid.
 Even within the limits of the  same genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many  species of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of  almost any other genus; but Gartner found that N.
 acuminata, which is  not a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or  to be fertilised, by no less than eight other species of Nicotiana.
 Many  analogous facts could be given.
    No one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of  difference, in any recognisable character, is sufficient to prevent two  species crossing.
 It can be shown that plants most widely different in  habit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences in  every part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the  cotyledons, can be crossed.
 Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and  evergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for  extremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease.
    By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for  instance, of a female-ass being first crossed by a stallion, and then  a mare by a male-ass: these two species may then be said to have been  reciprocally crossed.
 There is often the widest possible difference  in the facility of making reciprocal crosses.
 Such cases are highly  important, for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross  is often completely independent of their systematic affinity, that is  of any difference in their structure or constitution, excepting in their  reproductive systems.
 The diversity of the result in reciprocal crosses  between the same two species was long ago observed by Kolreuter.
 To give  an instance: Mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of  M.
 longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile;  but Kolreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following  years, to fertilise reciprocally M.
 longiflora with the pollen of M.
  jalapa, and utterly failed.
 Several other equally striking cases could  be given.
 Thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds  or Fuci.
 Gartner, moreover, found that this difference of facility in  making reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree.
 He has  observed it even between closely related forms (as Matthiola annua  and glabra) which many botanists rank only as varieties.
 It is also a  remarkable fact that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though of  course compounded of the very same two species, the one species having  first been used as the father and then as the mother, though they rarely  differ in external characters, yet generally differ in fertility in a  small, and occasionally in a high degree.
    Several other singular rules could be given from Gartner: for instance,  some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species;  other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing  their likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at  all necessarily go together.
 There are certain hybrids which, instead  of having, as is usual, an intermediate character between their two  parents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though  externally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with rare  exceptions extremely sterile.
 So again among hybrids which are usually  intermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional and  abnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one of  their pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile,  even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have  a considerable degree of fertility.
 These facts show how completely the  fertility of a hybrid may be independent of its external resemblance to  either pure parent.
    Considering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility  of first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be  considered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility  graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under  certain conditions in excess; that their fertility, besides being  eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is  innately variable; that it is by no means always the same in degree in  the first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross; that the  fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble  in external appearance either parent; and lastly, that the facility of  making a first cross between any two species is not always governed by  their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other.
 This  latter statement is clearly proved by the difference in the result of  reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for, according as the  one species or the other is used as the father or the mother, there  is generally some difference, and occasionally the widest possible  difference, in the facility of effecting an union.
 The hybrids,  moreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility.
    Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been  endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded  in nature? I think not.
 For why should the sterility be so extremely  different in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which  we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending  together? Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in  the individuals of the same species? Why should some species cross with  facility and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and other species cross  with extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids?  Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a  reciprocal cross between the same two species? Why, it may even be  asked, has the production of hybrids been permitted? To grant to species  the special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their further  propagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to  the facility of the first union between their parents, seems a strange  arrangement.
    The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly  to indicate that the sterility, both of first crosses and of hybrids,  is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences in their  reproductive systems; the differences being of so peculiar and limited  a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species,  the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female  sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed direction.
 It will be  advisable to explain a little more fully, by an example, what I mean  by sterility being incidental on other differences, and not a specially  endowed quality.
 As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on  another is unimportant for their welfare in a state of nature, I presume  that no one will suppose that this capacity is a SPECIALLY endowed  quality, but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws  of growth of the two plants.
 We can sometimes see the reason why one  tree will not take on another from differences in their rate of growth,  in the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or nature of  their sap, etc.
; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason  whatever.
 Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody and  the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and  adaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the two  grafting together.
 As in hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity  is limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able to graft  together trees belonging to quite distinct families; and, on the other  hand, closely allied species and varieties of the same species, can  usually, but not invariably, be grafted with ease.
 But this capacity,  as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed by systematic  affinity.
 Although many distinct genera within the same family have been  grafted together, in other cases species of the same genus will not take  on each other.
 The pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince,  which is ranked as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which is a  member of the same genus.
 Even different varieties of the pear take with  different degrees of facility on the quince; so do different varieties  of the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum.
    As Gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in  different INDIVIDUALS of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret  believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same  two species in being grafted together.
 As in reciprocal crosses, the  facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it  sometimes is in grafting.
 The common gooseberry, for instance, cannot  be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with  difficulty, on the gooseberry.
    We have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive  organs in an imperfect condition, is a different case from the  difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their reproductive  organs perfect; yet these two distinct classes of cases run to a large  extent parallel.
 Something analogous occurs in grafting; for Thouin  found that three species of Robinia, which seeded freely on their own  roots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on a fourth  species, when thus grafted were rendered barren.
 On the other hand,  certain species of Sorbus, when grafted on other species, yielded twice  as much fruit as when on their own roots.
 We are reminded by this latter  fact of the extraordinary cases of Hippeastrum, Passiflora, etc.
, which  seed much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of a distinct  species than when fertilised with pollen from the same plant.
    We thus see that, although there is a clear and great difference between  the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the male and female  elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a rude degree of  parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species.
  And as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the  facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on  unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so I believe that the  still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses are  incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems.
 These  differences in both cases follow, to a certain extent, as might  have been expected, systematic affinity, by which term every kind of  resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be  expressed.
 The facts by no means seem to indicate that the greater or  lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing various species  has been a special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the  difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific  forms as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare.
    ORIGIN AND CAUSES OF THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.
    At one time it appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that  the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been slowly  acquired through the natural selection of slightly lessened degrees of  fertility, which, like any other variation, spontaneously appeared in  certain individuals of one variety when crossed with those of another  variety.
 For it would clearly be advantageous to two varieties or  incipient species if they could be kept from blending, on the same  principle that, when man is selecting at the same time two varieties, it  is necessary that he should keep them separate.
 In the first place,  it may be remarked that species inhabiting distinct regions are often  sterile when crossed; now it could clearly have been of no advantage  to such separated species to have been rendered mutually sterile,  and consequently this could not have been effected through natural  selection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species was rendered  sterile with some one compatriot, sterility with other species would  follow as a necessary contingency.
 In the second place, it is almost as  much opposed to the theory of natural selection as to that of special  creation, that in reciprocal crosses the male element of one form should  have been rendered utterly impotent on a second form, while at the same  time the male element of this second form is enabled freely to fertilise  the first form; for this peculiar state of the reproductive system could  hardly have been advantageous to either species.
    In considering the probability of natural selection having come into  action, in rendering species mutually sterile, the greatest difficulty  will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps, from  slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility.
 It may be admitted  that it would profit an incipient species, if it were rendered in some  slight degree sterile when crossed with its parent form or with some  other variety; for thus fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring  would be produced to commingle their blood with the new species in  process of formation.
 But he who will take the trouble to reflect on the  steps by which this first degree of sterility could be increased through  natural selection to that high degree which is common with so  many species, and which is universal with species which have been  differentiated to a generic or family rank, will find the subject  extraordinarily complex.
 After mature reflection, it seems to me that  this could not have been effected through natural selection.
 Take the  case of any two species which, when crossed, produced few and sterile  offspring; now, what is there which could favour the survival of those  individuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher degree  with mutual infertility, and which thus approached by one small step  towards absolute sterility? Yet an advance of this kind, if the theory  of natural selection be brought to bear, must have incessantly occurred  with many species, for a multitude are mutually quite barren.
 With  sterile neuter insects we have reason to believe that modifications in  their structure and fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural  selection, from an advantage having been thus indirectly given to the  community to which they belonged over other communities of the same  species; but an individual animal not belonging to a social community,  if rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would  not thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage  to the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their  preservation.
    But it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail: for with  plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed species  must be due to some principle, quite independent of natural selection.
  Both Gartner and Kolreuter have proved that in genera including numerous  species, a series can be formed from species which when crossed yield  fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never produce a single seed, but  yet are affected by the pollen of certain other species, for the germen  swells.
 It is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile  individuals, which have already ceased to yield seeds; so that this acme  of sterility, when the germen alone is effected, cannot have been gained  through selection; and from the laws governing the various grades of  sterility being so uniform throughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms,  we may infer that the cause, whatever it may be, is the same or nearly  the same in all cases.
    We will now look a little closer at the probable nature of the  differences between species which induce sterility in first crosses and  in hybrids.
 In the case of first crosses, the greater or less difficulty  in effecting a union and in obtaining offspring apparently depends  on several distinct causes.
 There must sometimes be a physical  impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the  case with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to  reach the ovarium.
 It has also been observed that when the pollen of one  species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species, though  the pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface.
  Again, the male element may reach the female element, but be incapable  of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been the case  with some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci.
 No explanation can be given  of these facts, any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on  others.
 Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at an early  period.
 This latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to;  but I believe, from observations communicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who  has had great experience in hybridising pheasants and fowls, that the  early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first  crosses.
 Mr. Salter has recently given the results of an examination of  about 500 eggs produced from various crosses between three species  of Gallus and their hybrids; the majority of these eggs had been  fertilised; and in the majority of the fertilised eggs, the embryos had  either been partially developed and had then perished, or had become  nearly mature, but the young chickens had been unable to break through  the shell.
 Of the chickens which were born, more than four-fifths died  within the first few days, or at latest weeks, "without any obvious  cause, apparently from mere inability to live;" so that from the 500  eggs only twelve chickens were reared.
 With plants, hybridized embryos  probably often perish in a like manner; at least it is known that  hybrids raised from very distinct species are sometimes weak and  dwarfed, and perish at an early age; of which fact Max Wichura has  recently given some striking cases with hybrid willows.
 It may be here  worth noticing that in some cases of parthenogenesis, the embryos within  the eggs of silk moths which had not been fertilised, pass through their  early stages of development and then perish like the embryos produced by  a cross between distinct species.
 Until becoming acquainted with these  facts, I was unwilling to believe in the frequent early death of  hybrid embryos; for hybrids, when once born, are generally healthy and  long-lived, as we see in the case of the common mule.
 Hybrids, however,  are differently circumstanced before and after birth: when born and  living in a country where their two parents live, they are generally  placed under suitable conditions of life.
 But a hybrid partakes of only  half of the nature and constitution of its mother; it may therefore,  before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother's womb, or  within the egg or seed produced by the mother, be exposed to conditions  in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish at an  early period; more especially as all very young beings are eminently  sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life.
 But after all,  the cause more probably lies in some imperfection in the original act  of impregnation, causing the embryo to be imperfectly developed, rather  than in the conditions to which it is subsequently exposed.
    In regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are  imperfectly developed, the case is somewhat different.
 I have more than  once alluded to a large body of facts showing that, when animals and  plants are removed from their natural conditions, they are extremely  liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected.
 This,  in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of animals.
 Between the  sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points  of similarity.
 In both cases the sterility is independent of general  health, and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance.
  In both cases the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male  element is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female  more than the male.
 In both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with  systematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered  impotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole groups of species  tend to produce sterile hybrids.
 On the other hand, one species in a  group will sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired  fertility; and certain species in a group will produce unusually fertile  hybrids.
 No one can tell till he tries, whether any particular animal  will breed under confinement, or any exotic plant seed freely under  culture; nor can he tell till he tries, whether any two species of a  genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids.
 Lastly, when organic  beings are placed during several generations under conditions not  natural to them, they are extremely liable to vary, which seems to be  partly due to their reproductive systems having been specially affected,  though in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues.
 So it is with  hybrids, for their offspring in successive generations are eminently  liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed.
    Thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural  conditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of  two species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state  of health, is affected in a very similar manner.
 In the one case, the  conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so slight a  degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of  hybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but the  organisation has been disturbed by two distinct structures and  constitutions, including of course the reproductive systems, having been  blended into one.
 For it is scarcely possible that two organisations  should be compounded into one, without some disturbance occurring in the  development, or periodical action, or mutual relations of the different  parts and organs one to another or to the conditions of life.
 When  hybrids are able to breed inter se, they transmit to their offspring  from generation to generation the same compounded organisation, and  hence we need not be surprised that their sterility, though in some  degree variable, does not diminish; it is even apt to increase,  this being generally the result, as before explained, of too close  interbreeding.
 The above view of the sterility of hybrids being caused  by two constitutions being compounded into one has been strongly  maintained by Max Wichura.
    It must, however, be owned that we cannot understand, on the above or  any other view, several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids;  for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal  crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally  and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent.
 Nor do I pretend  that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation  is offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions,  is rendered sterile.
 All that I have attempted to show is, that in two  cases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common result--in the  one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other  case from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations  being compounded into one.
    A similar parallelism holds good with an allied yet very different  class of facts.
 It is an old and almost universal belief, founded on a  considerable body of evidence, which I have elsewhere given, that slight  changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things.
  We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent  exchanges of seed, tubers, etc.
, from one soil or climate to another,  and back again.
 During the convalescence of animals, great benefit is  derived from almost any change in their habits of life.
 Again, both with  plants and animals, there is the clearest evidence that a cross between  individuals of the same species, which differ to a certain extent, gives  vigour and fertility to the offspring; and that close interbreeding  continued during several generations between the nearest relations, if  these be kept under the same conditions of life, almost always leads to  decreased size, weakness, or sterility.
    Hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions  of life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight  crosses, that is, crosses between the males and females of the same  species, which have been subjected to slightly different conditions, or  which have slightly varied, give vigour and fertility to the offspring.
  But, as we have seen, organic beings long habituated to certain  uniform conditions under a state of nature, when subjected, as under  confinement, to a considerable change in their conditions, very  frequently are rendered more or less sterile; and we know that a cross  between two forms that have become widely or specifically different,  produce hybrids which are almost always in some degree sterile.
 I am  fully persuaded that this double parallelism is by no means an accident  or an illusion.
 He who is able to explain why the elephant, and a  multitude of other animals, are incapable of breeding when kept under  only partial confinement in their native country, will be able to  explain the primary cause of hybrids being so generally sterile.
 He will  at the same time be able to explain how it is that the races of some of  our domesticated animals, which have often been subjected to new and  not uniform conditions, are quite fertile together, although they are  descended from distinct species, which would probably have been sterile  if aboriginally crossed.
 The above two parallel series of facts seem  to be connected together by some common but unknown bond, which is  essentially related to the principle of life; this principle, according  to Mr. Herbert Spencer, being that life depends on, or consists in, the  incessant action and reaction of various forces, which, as throughout  nature, are always tending towards an equilibrium; and when this  tendency is slightly disturbed by any change, the vital forces gain in  power.
    RECIPROCAL DIMORPHISM AND TRIMORPHISM.
    This subject may be here briefly discussed, and will be found to throw  some light on hybridism.
 Several plants belonging to distinct orders  present two forms, which exist in about equal numbers and which differ  in no respect except in their reproductive organs; one form having  a long pistil with short stamens, the other a short pistil with long  stamens; the two having differently sized pollen-grains.
 With trimorphic  plants there are three forms likewise differing in the lengths of their  pistils and stamens, in the size and colour of the pollen-grains, and  in some other respects; and as in each of the three forms there are two  sets of stamens, the three forms possess altogether six sets of stamens  and three kinds of pistils.
 These organs are so proportioned in length  to each other that half the stamens in two of the forms stand on a level  with the stigma of the third form.
 Now I have shown, and the result  has been confirmed by other observers, that in order to obtain full  fertility with these plants, it is necessary that the stigma of the  one form should be fertilised by pollen taken from the stamens of  corresponding height in another form.
 So that with dimorphic species  two unions, which may be called legitimate, are fully fertile; and  two, which may be called illegitimate, are more or less infertile.
 With  trimorphic species six unions are legitimate, or fully fertile, and  twelve are illegitimate, or more or less infertile.
    The infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and  trimorphic plants, when they are illegitimately fertilised, that is by  pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil,  differs much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility; just in the  same manner as occurs in crossing distinct species.
 As the degree  of sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the  conditions of life being more or less favourable, so I have found it  with illegitimate unions.
 It is well known that if pollen of a distinct  species be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own pollen be  afterwards, even after a considerable interval of time, placed on the  same stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally  annihilates the effect of the foreign pollen; so it is with the pollen  of the several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is  strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on the  same stigma.
 I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers, first  illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately, with  pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the seedlings  were similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate pollen,  though applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly destroyed  or prevented the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen.
  Again, as in making reciprocal crosses between the same two species,  there is occasionally a great difference in the result, so the same  thing occurs with trimorphic plants; for instance, the mid-styled form  of Lythrum salicaria was illegitimately fertilised with the greatest  ease by pollen from the longer stamens of the short-styled form, and  yielded many seeds; but the latter form did not yield a single seed when  fertilised by the longer stamens of the mid-styled form.
    In all these respects, and in others which might be added, the forms  of the same undoubted species, when illegitimately united, behave in  exactly the same manner as do two distinct species when crossed.
 This  led me carefully to observe during four years many seedlings, raised  from several illegitimate unions.
 The chief result is that these  illegitimate plants, as they may be called, are not fully fertile.
 It  is possible to raise from dimorphic species, both long-styled and  short-styled illegitimate plants, and from trimorphic plants all three  illegitimate forms.
 These can then be properly united in a legitimate  manner.
 When this is done, there is no apparent reason why they  should not yield as many seeds as did their parents when legitimately  fertilised.
 But such is not the case.
 They are all infertile, in various  degrees; some being so utterly and incurably sterile that they did  not yield during four seasons a single seed or even seed-capsule.
 The  sterility of these illegitimate plants, when united with each other in  a legitimate manner, may be strictly compared with that of hybrids when  crossed inter se.
 If, on the other hand, a hybrid is crossed with either  pure parent-species, the sterility is usually much lessened: and so it  is when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant.
 In  the same manner as the sterility of hybrids does not always run  parallel with the difficulty of making the first cross between the two  parent-species, so that sterility of certain illegitimate plants was  unusually great, while the sterility of the union from which they  were derived was by no means great.
 With hybrids raised from the same  seed-capsule the degree of sterility is innately variable, so it is in a  marked manner with illegitimate plants.
 Lastly, many hybrids are profuse  and persistent flowerers, while other and more sterile hybrids produce  few flowers, and are weak, miserable dwarfs; exactly similar cases occur  with the illegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic  plants.
    Altogether there is the closest identity in character and behaviour  between illegitimate plants and hybrids.
 It is hardly an exaggeration  to maintain that illegitimate plants are hybrids, produced within the  limits of the same species by the improper union of certain forms, while  ordinary hybrids are produced from an improper union between so-called  distinct species.
 We have also already seen that there is the closest  similarity in all respects between first illegitimate unions and first  crosses between distinct species.
 This will perhaps be made more fully  apparent by an illustration; we may suppose that a botanist found two  well-marked varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled form of the  trimorphic Lythrum salicaria, and that he determined to try by crossing  whether they were specifically distinct.
 He would find that they yielded  only about one-fifth of the proper number of seed, and that they behaved  in all the other above specified respects as if they had been two  distinct species.
 But to make the case sure, he would raise plants from  his supposed hybridised seed, and he would find that the seedlings were  miserably dwarfed and utterly sterile, and that they behaved in all  other respects like ordinary hybrids.
 He might then maintain that he  had actually proved, in accordance with the common view, that his two  varieties were as good and as distinct species as any in the world; but  he would be completely mistaken.
    The facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important,  because they show us, first, that the physiological test of lessened  fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe criterion  of specific distinction; secondly, because we may conclude that there is  some unknown bond which connects the infertility of illegitimate unions  with that of their illegitimate offspring, and we are led to extend the  same view to first crosses and hybrids; thirdly, because we find, and  this seems to me of especial importance, that two or three forms of the  same species may exist and may differ in no respect whatever, either in  structure or in constitution, relatively to external conditions, and yet  be sterile when united in certain ways.
 For we must remember that it is  the union of the sexual elements of individuals of the same form, for  instance, of two long-styled forms, which results in sterility; while it  is the union of the sexual elements proper to two distinct forms which  is fertile.
 Hence the case appears at first sight exactly the reverse  of what occurs, in the ordinary unions of the individuals of the same  species and with crosses between distinct species.
 It is, however,  doubtful whether this is really so; but I will not enlarge on this  obscure subject.
    We may, however, infer as probable from the consideration of dimorphic  and trimorphic plants, that the sterility of distinct species when  crossed and of their hybrid progeny, depends exclusively on the nature  of their sexual elements, and not on any difference in their structure  or general constitution.
 We are also led to this same conclusion by  considering reciprocal crosses, in which the male of one species cannot  be united, or can be united with great difficulty, with the female of  a second species, while the converse cross can be effected with perfect  facility.
 That excellent observer, Gartner, likewise concluded that  species when crossed are sterile owing to differences confined to their  reproductive systems.
    FERTILITY OF VARIETIES WHEN CROSSED, AND OF THEIR MONGREL OFFSPRING, NOT  UNIVERSAL.
    It may be urged as an overwhelming argument that there must be some  essential distinction between species and varieties inasmuch as the  latter, however much they may differ from each other in external  appearance, cross with perfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile  offspring.
 With some exceptions, presently to be given, I fully admit  that this is the rule.
 But the subject is surrounded by difficulties,  for, looking to varieties produced under nature, if two forms hitherto  reputed to be varieties be found in any degree sterile together, they  are at once ranked by most naturalists as species.
 For instance, the  blue and red pimpernel, which are considered by most botanists as  varieties, are said by Gartner to be quite sterile when crossed, and  he consequently ranks them as undoubted species.
 If we thus argue in  a circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will  assuredly have to be granted.
    If we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced,  under domestication, we are still involved in some doubt.
 For when it  is stated, for instance, that certain South American indigenous domestic  dogs do not readily unite with European dogs, the explanation which will  occur to everyone, and probably the true one, is that they are descended  from aboriginally distinct species.
 Nevertheless the perfect fertility  of so many domestic races, differing widely from each other in  appearance, for instance, those of the pigeon, or of the cabbage, is a  remarkable fact; more especially when we reflect how many species there  are, which, though resembling each other most closely, are utterly  sterile when intercrossed.
 Several considerations, however, render the  fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable.
 In the first place,  it may be observed that the amount of external difference between two  species is no sure guide to their degree of mutual sterility, so that  similar differences in the case of varieties would be no sure guide.
 It  is certain that with species the cause lies exclusively in differences  in their sexual constitution.
 Now the varying conditions to which  domesticated animals and cultivated plants have been subjected, have had  so little tendency towards modifying the reproductive system in a manner  leading to mutual sterility, that we have good grounds for admitting  the directly opposite doctrine of Pallas, namely, that such conditions  generally eliminate this tendency; so that the domesticated descendants  of species, which in their natural state probably would have been in  some degree sterile when crossed, become perfectly fertile together.
  With plants, so far is cultivation from giving a tendency towards  sterility between distinct species, that in several well-authenticated  cases already alluded to, certain plants have been affected in an  opposite manner, for they have become self-impotent, while still  retaining the capacity of fertilising, and being fertilised by, other  species.
 If the Pallasian doctrine of the elimination of sterility  through long-continued domestication be admitted, and it can hardly  be rejected, it becomes in the highest degree improbable that similar  conditions long-continued should likewise induce this tendency; though  in certain cases, with species having a peculiar constitution, sterility  might occasionally be thus caused.
 Thus, as I believe, we can understand  why, with domesticated animals, varieties have not been produced  which are mutually sterile; and why with plants only a few such cases,  immediately to be given, have been observed.
    The real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears to me,  why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed,  but why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties, as soon  as they have been permanently modified in a sufficient degree to take  rank as species.
 We are far from precisely knowing the cause; nor is  this surprising, seeing how profoundly ignorant we are in regard to the  normal and abnormal action of the reproductive system.
 But we can  see that species, owing to their struggle for existence with numerous  competitors, will have been exposed during long periods of time to more  uniform conditions, than have domestic varieties; and this may well make  a wide difference in the result.
 For we know how commonly wild animals  and plants, when taken from their natural conditions and subjected  to captivity, are rendered sterile; and the reproductive functions of  organic beings which have always lived under natural conditions would  probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an  unnatural cross.
 Domesticated productions, on the other hand, which,  as shown by the mere fact of their domestication, were not originally  highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life, and which can  now generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of  conditions, might be expected to produce varieties, which would be  little liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously affected by  the act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like  manner.
    I have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were  invariably fertile when intercrossed.
 But it is impossible to resist the  evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few  following cases, which I will briefly abstract.
 The evidence is at least  as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of  species.
 The evidence is also derived from hostile witnesses, who in  all other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of  specific distinction.
 Gartner kept, during several years, a dwarf kind  of maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds growing  near each other in his garden; and although these plants have separated  sexes, they never naturally crossed.
 He then fertilised thirteen  flowers of the one kind with pollen of the other; but only a single  head produced any seed, and this one head produced only five grains.
  Manipulation in this case could not have been injurious, as the plants  have separated sexes.
 No one, I believe, has suspected that these  varieties of maize are distinct species; and it is important to notice  that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves PERFECTLY fertile;  so that even Gartner did not venture to consider the two varieties as  specifically distinct.
    Girou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like  the maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual  fertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are  greater.
 How far these experiments may be trusted, I know not; but  the forms experimented on are ranked by Sagaret, who mainly founds his  classification by the test of infertility, as varieties, and Naudin has  come to the same conclusion.
    The following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first  incredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments  made during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so good an  observer and so hostile a witness as Gartner: namely, that the yellow  and white varieties when crossed produce less seed than the similarly  coloured varieties of the same species.
 Moreover, he asserts that, when  yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and  white varieties of a DISTINCT species, more seed is produced by the  crosses between the similarly coloured flowers, than between those which  are differently coloured.
 Mr. Scott also has experimented on the species  and varieties of Verbascum; and although unable to confirm Gartner's  results on the crossing of the distinct species, he finds that the  dissimilarly coloured varieties of the same species yield fewer seeds,  in the proportion of eighty-six to 100, than the similarly coloured  varieties.
 Yet these varieties differ in no respect, except in the  colour of their flowers; and one variety can sometimes be raised from  the seed of another.
    Kolreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent  observer, has proved the remarkable fact that one particular variety  of the common tobacco was more fertile than the other varieties, when  crossed with a widely distinct species.
 He experimented on five forms  which are commonly reputed to be varieties, and which he tested by  the severest trial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he found their  mongrel offspring perfectly fertile.
 But one of these five varieties,  when used either as the father or mother, and crossed with the Nicotiana  glutinosa, always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were  produced from the four other varieties when crossed with N.
 glutinosa.
  Hence the reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some  manner and in some degree modified.
    From these facts it can no longer be maintained that varieties when  crossed are invariably quite fertile.
 From the great difficulty of  ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a  supposed variety, if proved to be infertile in any degree, would almost  universally be ranked as a species; from man attending only to external  characters in his domestic varieties, and from such varieties not having  been exposed for very long periods to uniform conditions of life; from  these several considerations we may conclude that fertility does not  constitute a fundamental distinction between varieties and species when  crossed.
 The general sterility of crossed species may safely be looked  at, not as a special acquirement or endowment, but as incidental on  changes of an unknown nature in their sexual elements.
    HYBRIDS AND MONGRELS COMPARED, INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR FERTILITY.
    Independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of species  and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other respects.
  Gartner, whose strong wish it was to draw a distinct line between  species and varieties, could find very few, and, as it seems to me,  quite unimportant differences between the so-called hybrid offspring of  species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of varieties.
 And, on the  other hand, they agree most closely in many important respects.
    I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity.
 The most  important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are  more variable than hybrids; but Gartner admits that hybrids from  species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first  generation; and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact.
  Gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species  are more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows  that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away.
  When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several  generations, an extreme amount of variability in the offspring in both  cases is notorious; but some few instances of both hybrids and mongrels  long retaining a uniform character could be given.
 The variability,  however, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater  than in hybrids.
    This greater variability in mongrels than in hybrids does not seem at  all surprising.
 For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly  domestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural  varieties), and this implies that there has been recent variability;  which would often continue and would augment that arising from the act  of crossing.
 The slight variability of hybrids in the first generation,  in contrast with that in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact  and deserves attention.
 For it bears on the view which I have taken of  one of the causes of ordinary variability; namely, that the reproductive  system, from being eminently sensitive to changed conditions of life,  fails under these circumstances to perform its proper function of  producing offspring closely similar in all respects to the parent-form.
  Now, hybrids in the first generation are descended from species  (excluding those long cultivated) which have not had their reproductive  systems in any way affected, and they are not variable; but hybrids  themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected, and their  descendants are highly variable.
    But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gartner states  that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parent  form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in degree.
  Moreover, Gartner expressly states that the hybrids from long cultivated  plants are more subject to reversion than hybrids from species in their  natural state; and this probably explains the singular difference in  the results arrived at by different observers.
 Thus Max Wichura doubts  whether hybrids ever revert to their parent forms, and he experimented  on uncultivated species of willows, while Naudin, on the other hand,  insists in the strongest terms on the almost universal tendency to  reversion in hybrids, and he experimented chiefly on cultivated plants.
  Gartner further states that when any two species, although most closely  allied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids are  widely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct varieties  of one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids do not  differ much.
 But this conclusion, as far as I can make out, is founded  on a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to the results of  several experiments made by Kolreuter.
    Such alone are the unimportant differences which Gartner is able to  point out between hybrid and mongrel plants.
 On the other hand, the  degrees and kinds of resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their  respective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly  related species, follow, according to Gartner the same laws.
 When two  species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing  its likeness on the hybrid.
 So I believe it to be with varieties of  plants; and with animals, one variety certainly often has this prepotent  power over another variety.
 Hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal  cross generally resemble each other closely, and so it is with mongrel  plants from a reciprocal cross.
 Both hybrids and mongrels can be  reduced to either pure parent form, by repeated crosses in successive  generations with either parent.
    These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the  subject is here much complicated, partly owing to the existence of  secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency  in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in  the other, both when one species is crossed with another and when one  variety is crossed with another variety.
 For instance, I think those  authors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over  the horse, so that both the mule and the hinny resemble more closely the  ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the  male than in the female ass, so that the mule, which is an offspring of  the male ass and mare, is more like an ass than is the hinny, which is  the offspring of the female-ass and stallion.
    Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that  it is only with mongrels that the offspring are not intermediate in  character, but closely resemble one of their parents; but this does  sometimes occur with hybrids, yet I grant much less frequently than  with mongrels.
 Looking to the cases which I have collected of cross-bred  animals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly  confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature, and which have  suddenly appeared--such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or  horns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not relate to characters  which have been slowly acquired through selection.
 A tendency to sudden  reversions to the perfect character of either parent would, also,  be much more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from  varieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than  with hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally  produced.
 On the whole, I entirely agree with Dr.
 Prosper Lucas, who,  after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals,  comes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its  parents are the same, whether the two parents differ little or much from  each other, namely, in the union of individuals of the same variety, or  of different varieties, or of distinct species.
    Independently of the question of fertility and sterility, in all  other respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the  offspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties.
 If we look at  species as having been specially created, and at varieties as having  been produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an astonishing  fact.
 But it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no  essential distinction between species and varieties.
    SUMMARY OF CHAPTER.
    First crosses between forms, sufficiently distinct to be ranked as  species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally,  sterile.
 The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that  the most careful experimentalists have arrived at diametrically opposite  conclusions in ranking forms by this test.
 The sterility is innately  variable in individuals of the same species, and is eminently  susceptible to action of favourable and unfavourable conditions.
 The  degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is  governed by several curious and complex laws.
 It is generally different,  and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same  two species.
 It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in  the hybrids produced from this cross.
    In the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity in one species or  variety to take on another, is incidental on differences, generally  of an unknown nature, in their vegetative systems, so in crossing,  the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is  incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems.
 There  is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with  various degrees of sterility to prevent their crossing and blending  in nature, than to think that trees have been specially endowed with  various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted  together in order to prevent their inarching in our forests.
    The sterility of first crosses and of their hybrid progeny has not been  acquired through natural selection.
 In the case of first crosses it  seems to depend on several circumstances; in some instances in chief  part on the early death of the embryo.
 In the case of hybrids, it  apparently depends on their whole organisation having been disturbed by  being compounded from two distinct forms; the sterility being closely  allied to that which so frequently affects pure species, when exposed to  new and unnatural conditions of life.
 He who will explain these latter  cases will be able to explain the sterility of hybrids.
 This view is  strongly supported by a parallelism of another kind: namely, that,  firstly, slight changes in the conditions of life add to the vigour  and fertility of all organic beings; and secondly, that the crossing of  forms, which have been exposed to slightly different conditions of life,  or which have varied, favours the size, vigour and fertility of their  offspring.
 The facts given on the sterility of the illegitimate unions  of dimorphic and trimorphic plants and of their illegitimate progeny,  perhaps render it probable that some unknown bond in all cases connects  the degree of fertility of first unions with that of their offspring.
  The consideration of these facts on dimorphism, as well as of the  results of reciprocal crosses, clearly leads to the conclusion that  the primary cause of the sterility of crossed species is confined to  differences in their sexual elements.
 But why, in the case of distinct  species, the sexual elements should so generally have become more or  less modified, leading to their mutual infertility, we do not know; but  it seems to stand in some close relation to species having been exposed  for long periods of time to nearly uniform conditions of life.
    It is not surprising that the difficulty in crossing any two species,  and the sterility of their hybrid offspring, should in most cases  correspond, even if due to distinct causes: for both depend on the  amount of difference between the species which are crossed.
 Nor is  it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, and the  fertility of the hybrids thus produced, and the capacity of being  grafted together--though this latter capacity evidently depends on  widely different circumstances--should all run, to a certain extent,  parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms subjected to  experiment; for systematic affinity includes resemblances of all kinds.
    First crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike  to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very  generally, but not, as is so often stated, invariably fertile.
 Nor  is this almost universal and perfect fertility surprising, when it  is remembered how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to  varieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater  number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the  selection of mere external differences, and that they have not been long  exposed to uniform conditions of life.
 It should also be especially kept  in mind, that long-continued domestication tends to eliminate  sterility, and is therefore little likely to induce this same quality.
  Independently of the question of fertility, in all other respects there  is the closest general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels, in  their variability, in their power of absorbing each other by repeated  crosses, and in their inheritance of characters from both parent-forms.
  Finally, then, although we are as ignorant of the precise cause of the  sterility of first crosses and of hybrids as we are why animals and  plants removed from their natural conditions become sterile, yet the  facts given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to the belief that  species aboriginally existed as varieties.

 ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD.
     On the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day--On the   nature of extinct intermediate varieties; on their number--On the lapse   of time, as inferred from the rate of denudation and of deposition   number--On the lapse of time as estimated by years--On the poorness of   our palaeontological collections--On the intermittence of geological   formations--On the denudation of granitic areas--On the absence of   intermediate varieties in any one formation--On the sudden appearance   of groups of species--On their sudden appearance in the lowest known   fossiliferous strata--Antiquity of the habitable earth.
      In the sixth  enumerated the chief objections which might be  justly urged against the views maintained in this volume.
 Most of them  have now been discussed.
 One, namely, the distinctness of specific forms  and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links,  is a very obvious difficulty.
 I assigned reasons why such links do not  commonly occur at the present day under the circumstances apparently  most favourable for their presence, namely, on an extensive and  continuous area with graduated physical conditions.
 I endeavoured to  show, that the life of each species depends in a more important manner  on the presence of other already defined organic forms, than on climate,  and, therefore, that the really governing conditions of life do not  graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture.
 I endeavoured,  also, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser  numbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be beaten  out and exterminated during the course of further modification and  improvement.
 The main cause, however, of innumerable intermediate links  not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends, on the very  process of natural selection, through which new varieties continually  take the places of and supplant their parent-forms.
 But just in  proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous  scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly  existed, be truly enormous.
 Why then is not every geological formation  and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly  does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this,  perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged  against my theory.
 The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme  imperfection of the geological record.
    In the first place, it should always be borne in mind what sort of  intermediate forms must, on the theory, have formerly existed.
 I have  found it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing  to myself forms DIRECTLY intermediate between them.
 But this is a wholly  false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each  species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor  will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified  descendants.
 To give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter  pigeons are both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all  the intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an  extremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should  have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter;  none, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop  somewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds.
  These two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that, if we  had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would  not have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of  their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, C.
 livia, whether they had  descended from this species or from some other allied species, such as  C.
 oenas.
    So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance  to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links directly  intermediate between them ever existed, but between each and an unknown  common parent.
 The common parent will have had in its whole organisation  much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but in some  points of structure may have differed considerably from both, even  perhaps more than they differ from each other.
 Hence, in all such cases,  we should be unable to recognise the parent-form of any two or more  species, even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with  that of its modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a  nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links.
    It is just possible, by the theory, that one of two living forms might  have descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and  in this case DIRECT intermediate links will have existed between them.
  But such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long  period unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of  change; and the principle of competition between organism and organism,  between child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all  cases the new and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and  unimproved forms.
    By the theory of natural selection all living species have been  connected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not  greater than we see between the natural and domestic varieties of the  same species at the present day; and these parent-species, now generally  extinct, have in their turn been similarly connected with more ancient  forms; and so on backwards, always converging to the common ancestor of  each great class.
 So that the number of intermediate and transitional  links, between all living and extinct species, must have been  inconceivably great.
 But assuredly, if this theory be true, such have  lived upon the earth.
    ON THE LAPSE OF TIME, AS INFERRED FROM THE RATE OF DEPOSITION AND EXTENT  OF DENUDATION.
    Independently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely  numerous connecting links, it may be objected that time cannot have  sufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all changes having  been effected slowly.
 It is hardly possible for me to recall to the  reader who is not a practical geologist, the facts leading the mind  feebly to comprehend the lapse of time.
 He who can read Sir Charles  Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future  historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural  science, and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of  time, may at once close this volume.
 Not that it suffices to study  the Principles of Geology, or to read special treatises by different  observers on separate formations, and to mark how each author attempts  to give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation, or even  of each stratum.
 We can best gain some idea of past time by knowing the  agencies at work; and learning how deeply the surface of the land has  been denuded, and how much sediment has been deposited.
 As Lyell has  well remarked, the extent and thickness of our sedimentary formations  are the result and the measure of the denudation which the earth's crust  has elsewhere undergone.
 Therefore a man should examine for himself the  great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the rivulets bringing down  mud, and the waves wearing away the sea-cliffs, in order to comprehend  something about the duration of past time, the monuments of which we see  all around us.
    It is good to wander along the coast, when formed of moderately hard  rocks, and mark the process of degradation.
 The tides in most cases  reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat  into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there is  good evidence that pure water effects nothing in wearing away rock.
 At  last the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall down, and  these remaining fixed, have to be worn away atom by atom, until after  being reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then  they are more quickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud.
 But how often  do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all  thickly clothed by marine productions, showing how little they are  abraded and how seldom they are rolled about! Moreover, if we follow for  a few miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing degradation,  we find that it is only here and there, along a short length or round  a promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time suffering.
 The  appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years  have elapsed since the waters washed their base.
    We have, however, recently learned from the observations of Ramsay, in  the van of many excellent observers--of Jukes, Geikie, Croll and  others, that subaerial degradation is a much more important agency than  coast-action, or the power of the waves.
 The whole surface of the land  is exposed to the chemical action of the air and of the rainwater,  with its dissolved carbonic acid, and in colder countries to frost; the  disintegrated matter is carried down even gentle slopes during heavy  rain, and to a greater extent than might be supposed, especially in  arid districts, by the wind; it is then transported by the streams  and rivers, which, when rapid deepen their channels, and triturate the  fragments.
 On a rainy day, even in a gently undulating country, we see  the effects of subaerial degradation in the muddy rills which flow down  every slope.
 Messrs.
 Ramsay and Whitaker have shown, and the observation  is a most striking one, that the great lines of escarpment in the  Wealden district and those ranging across England, which formerly were  looked at as ancient sea-coasts, cannot have been thus formed, for each  line is composed of one and the same formation, while our sea-cliffs are  everywhere formed by the intersection of various formations.
 This being  the case, we are compelled to admit that the escarpments owe their  origin in chief part to the rocks of which they are composed, having  resisted subaerial denudation better than the surrounding surface;  this surface consequently has been gradually lowered, with the lines of  harder rock left projecting.
 Nothing impresses the mind with the vast  duration of time, according to our ideas of time, more forcibly than the  conviction thus gained that subaerial agencies, which apparently have  so little power, and which seem to work so slowly, have produced great  results.
    When thus impressed with the slow rate at which the land is worn  away through subaerial and littoral action, it is good, in order to  appreciate the past duration of time, to consider, on the one hand, the  masses of rock which have been removed over many extensive areas, and on  the other hand the thickness of our sedimentary formations.
 I remember  having been much struck when viewing volcanic islands, which have been  worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of  one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the  lava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how  far the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean.
 The same  story is told still more plainly by faults--those great cracks along  which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the  other, to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust  cracked, and it makes no great difference whether the upheaval was  sudden, or, as most geologists now believe, was slow and effected by  many starts, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down  that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible.
 The  Craven fault, for instance, extends for upward of thirty miles, and  along this line the vertical displacement of the strata varies from 600  to 3,000 feet.
 Professor Ramsay has published an account of a downthrow  in Anglesea of 2,300 feet; and he informs me that he fully believes that  there is one in Merionethshire of 12,000 feet; yet in these cases there  is nothing on the surface of the land to show such prodigious movements;  the pile of rocks on either side of the crack having been smoothly swept  away.
    On the other hand, in all parts of the world the piles of sedimentary  strata are of wonderful thickness.
 In the Cordillera, I estimated one  mass of conglomerate at ten thousand feet; and although conglomerates  have probably been accumulated at a quicker rate than finer sediments,  yet from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles, each of which bears  the stamp of time, they are good to show how slowly the mass must  have been heaped together.
 Professor Ramsay has given me the maximum  thickness, from actual measurement in most cases, of the successive  formations in DIFFERENT parts of Great Britain; and this is the  result:--                                                      Feet     Palaeozoic strata (not including igneous beds).

2,240     --making altogether 72,584 feet;      that is, very nearly thirteen and three-quarters British miles.
  Some of these formations, which are represented in England by thin beds,  are thousands of feet in thickness on the Continent.
 Moreover, between  each successive formation we have, in the opinion of most geologists,  blank periods of enormous length.
 So that the lofty pile of sedimentary  rocks in Britain gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has  elapsed during their accumulation.
 The consideration of these various  facts impresses the mind almost in the same manner as does the vain  endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity.
    Nevertheless this impression is partly false.
 Mr. Croll, in an  interesting paper, remarks that we do not err "in forming too great a  conception of the length of geological periods," but in estimating them  by years.
 When geologists look at large and complicated phenomena, and  then at the figures representing several million years, the two produce  a totally different effect on the mind, and the figures are at once  pronounced too small.
 In regard to subaerial denudation, Mr. Croll  shows, by calculating the known amount of sediment annually brought down  by certain rivers, relatively to their areas of drainage, that 1,000  feet of solid rock, as it became gradually disintegrated, would thus  be removed from the mean level of the whole area in the course of six  million years.
 This seems an astonishing result, and some considerations  lead to the suspicion that it may be too large, but if halved or  quartered it is still very surprising.
 Few of us, however, know what a  million really means: Mr. Croll gives the following illustration: Take  a narrow strip of paper, eighty-three feet four inches in length, and  stretch it along the wall of a large hall; then mark off at one end  the tenth of an inch.
 This tenth of an inch will represent one hundred  years, and the entire strip a million years.
 But let it be borne in  mind, in relation to the subject of this work, what a hundred years  implies, represented as it is by a measure utterly insignificant in a  hall of the above dimensions.
 Several eminent breeders, during a single  lifetime, have so largely modified some of the higher animals, which  propagate their kind much more slowly than most of the lower animals,  that they have formed what well deserves to be called a new sub-breed.
  Few men have attended with due care to any one strain for more than half  a century, so that a hundred years represents the work of two breeders  in succession.
 It is not to be supposed that species in a state of  nature ever change so quickly as domestic animals under the guidance of  methodical selection.
 The comparison would be in every way fairer  with the effects which follow from unconscious selection, that is, the  preservation of the most useful or beautiful animals, with no intention  of modifying the breed; but by this process of unconscious selection,  various breeds have been sensibly changed in the course of two or three  centuries.
    Species, however, probably change much more slowly, and within the same  country only a few change at the same time.
 This slowness follows from  all the inhabitants of the same country being already so well adapted to  each other, that new places in the polity of nature do not occur until  after long intervals, due to the occurrence of physical changes of some  kind, or through the immigration of new forms.
 Moreover, variations  or individual differences of the right nature, by which some of the  inhabitants might be better fitted to their new places under the altered  circumstance, would not always occur at once.
 Unfortunately we have no  means of determining, according to the standard of years, how long a  period it takes to modify a species; but to the subject of time we must  return.
    ON THE POORNESS OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS.
    Now let us turn to our richest museums, and what a paltry display we  behold! That our collections are imperfect is admitted by every one.
 The  remark of that admirable palaeontologist, Edward Forbes, should never  be forgotten, namely, that very many fossil species are known and  named from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens  collected on some one spot.
 Only a small portion of the surface of the  earth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient  care, as the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove.
  No organism wholly soft can be preserved.
 Shells and bones decay and  disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not  accumulating.
 We probably take a quite erroneous view, when we assume  that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea,  at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains.
  Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue  tint of the water bespeaks its purity.
 The many cases on record of a  formation conformably covered, after an immense interval of time, by  another and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered  in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view  of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered  condition.
 The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel,  will, when the beds are upraised, generally be dissolved by the  percolation of rain water charged with carbonic acid.
 Some of the many  kinds of animals which live on the beach between high and low water mark  seem to be rarely preserved.
 For instance, the several species of the  Chthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all  over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly littoral, with  the exception of a single Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep  water and this has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one other  species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is  known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the Chalk period.
  Lastly, many great deposits, requiring a vast length of time for their  accumulation, are entirely destitute of organic remains, without our  being able to assign any reason: one of the most striking instances is  that of the Flysch formation, which consists of shale and sandstone,  several thousand, occasionally even six thousand feet in thickness,  and extending for at least 300 miles from Vienna to Switzerland; and  although this great mass has been most carefully searched, no fossils,  except a few vegetable remains, have been found.
    With respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the  Secondary and Palaeozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that  our evidence is fragmentary in an extreme degree.
 For instance, until  recently not a land-shell was known belonging to either of these vast  periods, with the exception of one species discovered by Sir C.
 Lyell  and Dr.
 Dawson in the carboniferous strata of North America; but now  land-shells have been found in the lias.
 In regard to mammiferous  remains, a glance at the historical table published in Lyell's  Manual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and rare is their  preservation, far better than pages of detail.
 Nor is their rarity  surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of  tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine  deposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging  to the age of our secondary or palaeozoic formations.
    But the imperfection in the geological record largely results from  another and more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from  the several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals  of time.
 This doctrine has been emphatically admitted by many geologists  and palaeontologists, who, like E.
 Forbes, entirely disbelieve in the  change of species.
 When we see the formations tabulated in written  works, or when we follow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid  believing that they are closely consecutive.
 But we know, for instance,  from Sir R.
 Murchison's great work on Russia, what wide gaps there are  in that country between the superimposed formations; so it is in  North America, and in many other parts of the world.
 The most skilful  geologist, if his attention had been confined exclusively to these large  territories, would never have suspected that during the periods which  were blank and barren in his own country, great piles of sediment,  charged with new and peculiar forms of life, had elsewhere been  accumulated.
 And if, in every separate territory, hardly any idea can be  formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive  formations, we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained.
  The frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition  of consecutive formations, generally implying great changes in the  geography of the surrounding lands, whence the sediment was derived,  accord with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between  each formation.
    We can, I think, see why the geological formations of each region are  almost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each other  in close sequence.
 Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many  hundred miles of the South American coasts, which have been upraised  several hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of  any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short  geological period.
 Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by  a peculiar marine fauna, tertiary beds are so poorly developed that no  record of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be  preserved to a distant age.
 A little reflection will explain why, along  the rising coast of the western side of South America, no extensive  formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found, though  the supply of sediment must for ages have been great, from the enormous  degradation of the coast rocks and from the muddy streams entering the  sea.
 The explanation, no doubt, is that the littoral and sub-littoral  deposits are continually worn away, as soon as they are brought up by  the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of  the coast-waves.
    We may, I think, conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely  thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the incessant  action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent  oscillations of level, as well as the subsequent subaerial degradation.
  Such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two  ways; either in profound depths of the sea, in which case the bottom  will not be inhabited by so many and such varied forms of life as the  more shallow seas; and the mass when upraised will give an imperfect  record of the organisms which existed in the neighbourhood during  the period of its accumulation.
 Or sediment may be deposited to any  thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to  subside.
 In this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and  supply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain  shallow and favourable for many and varied forms, and thus a rich  fossiliferous formation, thick enough, when upraised, to resist a large  amount of denudation, may be formed.
    I am convinced that nearly all our ancient formations, which are  throughout the greater part of their thickness RICH IN FOSSILS, have  thus been formed during subsidence.
 Since publishing my views on this  subject in 1845, I have watched the progress of geology, and have been  surprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that  great formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated  during subsidence.
 I may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation  on the west coast of South America, which has been bulky enough to  resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will  hardly last to a distant geological age, was deposited during a downward  oscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness.
    All geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone  numerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations  have affected wide spaces.
 Consequently, formations rich in fossils and  sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, will  have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only  where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and  to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay.
 On the  other hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, THICK  deposits cannot have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are  the most favourable to life.
 Still less can this have happened during  the alternate periods of elevation; or, to speak more accurately, the  beds which were then accumulated will generally have been destroyed by  being upraised and brought within the limits of the coast-action.
    These remarks apply chiefly to littoral and sublittoral deposits.
 In the  case of an extensive and shallow sea, such as that within a large part  of the Malay Archipelago, where the depth varies from thirty or forty  to sixty fathoms, a widely extended formation might be formed during  a period of elevation, and yet not suffer excessively from denudation  during its slow upheaval; but the thickness of the formation could not  be great, for owing to the elevatory movement it would be less than  the depth in which it was formed; nor would the deposit be much  consolidated, nor be capped by overlying formations, so that it would  run a good chance of being worn away by atmospheric degradation and by  the action of the sea during subsequent oscillations of level.
 It has,  however, been suggested by Mr. Hopkins, that if one part of the area,  after rising and before being denuded, subsided, the deposit formed  during the rising movement, though not thick, might afterwards become  protected by fresh accumulations, and thus be preserved for a long  period.
    Mr. Hopkins also expresses his belief that sedimentary beds of  considerable horizontal extent have rarely been completely destroyed.
  But all geologists, excepting the few who believe that our present  metamorphic schists and plutonic rocks once formed the primordial  nucleus of the globe, will admit that these latter rocks have been  stripped of their covering to an enormous extent.
 For it is scarcely  possible that such rocks could have been solidified and crystallised  while uncovered; but if the metamorphic action occurred at profound  depths of the ocean, the former protecting mantle of rock may not have  been very thick.
 Admitting then that gneiss, mica-schist, granite,  diorite, etc.
, were once necessarily covered up, how can we account for  the naked and extensive areas of such rocks in many parts of the world,  except on the belief that they have subsequently been completely denuded  of all overlying strata? That such extensive areas do exist cannot be  doubted: the granitic region of Parime is described by Humboldt as being  at least nineteen times as large as Switzerland.
 South of the Amazon,  Boue colours an area composed of rocks of this nature as equal to that  of Spain, France, Italy, part of Germany, and the British Islands, all  conjoined.
 This region has not been carefully explored, but from the  concurrent testimony of travellers, the granitic area is very large:  thus Von Eschwege gives a detailed section of these rocks, stretching  from Rio de Janeiro for 260 geographical miles inland in a straight  line; and I travelled for 150 miles in another direction, and saw  nothing but granitic rocks.
 Numerous specimens, collected along the  whole coast, from near Rio de Janeiro to the mouth of the Plata, a  distance of 1,100 geographical miles, were examined by me, and they all  belonged to this class.
 Inland, along the whole northern bank of the  Plata, I saw, besides modern tertiary beds, only one small patch of  slightly metamorphosed rock, which alone could have formed a part of the  original capping of the granitic series.
 Turning to a well-known region,  namely, to the United States and Canada, as shown in Professor H.
D.
  Rogers' beautiful map, I have estimated the areas by cutting out and  weighing the paper, and I find that the metamorphic (excluding the  "semi-metamorphic") and granite rocks exceed, in the proportion of 19 to  12.
5, the whole of the newer Palaeozoic formations.
 In many regions the  metamorphic and granite rocks would be found much more widely extended  than they appear to be, if all the sedimentary beds were removed which  rest unconformably on them, and which could not have formed part of  the original mantle under which they were crystallised.
 Hence, it is  probable that in some parts of the world whole formations have been  completely denuded, with not a wreck left behind.
      One remark is here worth a passing notice.
 During periods of elevation  the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will  be increased and new stations will often be formed--all circumstances  favourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties  and species; but during such periods there will generally be a blank  in the geological record.
 On the other hand, during subsidence, the  inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting on  the shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago), and  consequently during subsidence, though there will be much extinction,  few new varieties or species will be formed; and it is during these very  periods of subsidence that the deposits which are richest in fossils  have been accumulated.
    ON THE ABSENCE OF NUMEROUS INTERMEDIATE VARIETIES IN ANY SINGLE  FORMATION.
    From these several considerations it cannot be doubted that the  geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if  we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes much more  difficult to understand why we do not therein find closely graduated  varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and  at its close.
 Several cases are on record of the same species presenting  varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation.
 Thus  Trautschold gives a number of instances with Ammonites, and Hilgendorf  has described a most curious case of ten graduated forms of Planorbis  multiformis in the successive beds of a fresh-water formation in  Switzerland.
 Although each formation has indisputably required a vast  number of years for its deposition, several reasons can be given why  each should not commonly include a graduated series of links between the  species which lived at its commencement and close, but I cannot assign  due proportional weight to the following considerations.
    Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each  probably is short compared with the period requisite to change one  species into another.
 I am aware that two palaeontologists, whose  opinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have  concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice  as long as the average duration of specific forms.
 But insuperable  difficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us from coming to any just  conclusion on this head.
 When we see a species first appearing in the  middle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to infer  that it had not elsewhere previously existed.
 So again, when we find  a species disappearing before the last layers have been deposited, it  would be equally rash to suppose that it then became extinct.
 We forget  how small the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the world;  nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout Europe been  correlated with perfect accuracy.
    We may safely infer that with marine animals of all kinds there has been  a large amount of migration due to climatal and other changes; and when  we see a species first appearing in any formation, the probability is  that it only then first immigrated into that area.
 It is well known, for  instance, that several species appear somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic  beds of North America than in those of Europe; time having apparently  been required for their migration from the American to the European  seas.
 In examining the latest deposits, in various quarters of the  world, it has everywhere been noted, that some few still existing  species are common in the deposit, but have become extinct in the  immediately surrounding sea; or, conversely, that some are now abundant  in the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent in this particular  deposit.
 It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount  of migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the glacial epoch,  which forms only a part of one whole geological period; and likewise to  reflect on the changes of level, on the extreme change of climate,  and on the great lapse of time, all included within this same glacial  period.
 Yet it may be doubted whether, in any quarter of the  world, sedimentary deposits, INCLUDING FOSSIL REMAINS, have gone on  accumulating within the same area during the whole of this period.
 It is  not, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited during the whole  of the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi, within that  limit of depth at which marine animals can best flourish: for we know  that great geographical changes occurred in other parts of America  during this space of time.
 When such beds as were deposited in shallow  water near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial  period shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first  appear and disappear at different levels, owing to the migrations  of species and to geographical changes.
 And in the distant future, a  geologist, examining these beds, would be tempted to conclude that the  average duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that  of the glacial period, instead of having been really far greater, that  is, extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day.
    In order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper  and lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on  continuously accumulating during a long period, sufficient for the slow  process of modification; hence, the deposit must be a very thick one;  and the species undergoing change must have lived in the same district  throughout the whole time.
 But we have seen that a thick formation,  fossiliferous throughout its entire thickness, can accumulate only  during a period of subsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the  same, which is necessary that the same marine species may live on the  same space, the supply of sediment must nearly counterbalance the  amount of subsidence.
 But this same movement of subsidence will tend to  submerge the area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the  supply, whilst the downward movement continues.
 In fact, this nearly  exact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of  subsidence is probably a rare contingency; for it has been observed  by more than one palaeontologist that very thick deposits are usually  barren of organic remains, except near their upper or lower limits.
    It would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of  formations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its  accumulation.
 When we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed  of beds of widely different mineralogical composition, we may  reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been more or less  interrupted.
 Nor will the closest inspection of a formation give us any  idea of the length of time which its deposition may have consumed.
  Many instances could be given of beds, only a few feet in thickness,  representing formations which are elsewhere thousands of feet in  thickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their  accumulation; yet no one ignorant of this fact would have even suspected  the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation.
 Many cases  could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised,  denuded, submerged, and then re-covered by the upper beds of the same  formation--facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals  have occurred in its accumulation.
 In other cases we have the plainest  evidence in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew,  of many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process  of deposition, which would not have been suspected, had not the trees  been preserved: thus Sir C.
 Lyell and Dr.
 Dawson found carboniferous  beds 1,400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata,  one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight different levels.
  Hence, when the same species occurs at the bottom, middle, and top of  a formation, the probability is that it has not lived on the same  spot during the whole period of deposition, but has disappeared and  reappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period.
  Consequently if it were to undergo a considerable amount of modification  during the deposition of any one geological formation, a section would  not include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on our  theory have existed, but abrupt, though perhaps slight, changes of form.
    It is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule  by which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little  variability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater  amount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species,  unless they are enabled to connect them together by the closest  intermediate gradations; and this, from the reasons just assigned, we  can seldom hope to effect in any one geological section.
 Supposing B  and C to be two species, and a third, A, to be found in an older and  underlying bed; even if A were strictly intermediate between B and C,  it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species, unless at the  same time it could be closely connected by intermediate varieties  with either one or both forms.
 Nor should it be forgotten, as before  explained, that A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet  would not necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all  respects.
 So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several  modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of the same  formation, and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we  should not recognise their blood-relationship, and should consequently  rank them as distinct species.
    It is notorious on what excessively slight differences many  palaeontologists have founded their species; and they do this the more  readily if the specimens come from different sub-stages of the same  formation.
 Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the  very fine species of D'Orbigny and others into the rank of varieties;  and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on  the theory we ought to find.
 Look again at the later tertiary deposits,  which include many shells believed by the majority of naturalists to  be identical with existing species; but some excellent naturalists,  as Agassiz and Pictet, maintain that all these tertiary species are  specifically distinct, though the distinction is admitted to be very  slight; so that here, unless we believe that these eminent naturalists  have been misled by their imaginations, and that these late tertiary  species really present no difference whatever from their living  representatives, or unless we admit, in opposition to the judgment of  most naturalists, that these tertiary species are all truly distinct  from the recent, we have evidence of the frequent occurrence of slight  modifications of the kind required.
 If we look to rather wider intervals  of time, namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great  formation, we find that the embedded fossils, though universally ranked  as specifically different, yet are far more closely related to each  other than are the species found in more widely separated formations;  so that here again we have undoubted evidence of change in the direction  required by the theory; but to this latter subject I shall return in the  following chapter.
    With animals and plants that propagate rapidly and do not wander  much, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their  varieties are generally at first local; and that such local varieties  do not spread widely and supplant their parent-form until they have been  modified and perfected in some considerable degree.
 According to this  view, the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all  the early stages of transition between any two forms, is small, for the  successive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to some  one spot.
 Most marine animals have a wide range; and we have seen that  with plants it is those which have the widest range, that oftenest  present varieties, so that, with shells and other marine animals, it is  probable that those which had the widest range, far exceeding the limits  of the known geological formations in Europe, have oftenest given rise,  first to local varieties and ultimately to new species; and this again  would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of  transition in any one geological formation.
    It is a more important consideration, leading to the same result, as  lately insisted on by Dr.
 Falconer, namely, that the period during which  each species underwent modification, though long as measured by years,  was probably short in comparison with that during which it remained  without undergoing any change.
    It should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect  specimens for examination, two forms can seldom be connected by  intermediate varieties, and thus proved to be the same species, until  many specimens are collected from many places; and with fossil  species this can rarely be done.
 We shall, perhaps, best perceive the  improbability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous, fine,  intermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether, for instance,  geologists at some future period will be able to prove that our  different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs are descended from  a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks; or, again, whether  certain sea-shells inhabiting the shores of North America, which are  ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their European  representatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties, are  really varieties, or are, as it is called, specifically distinct.
 This  could be effected by the future geologist only by his discovering in  a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations; and such success is  improbable in the highest degree.
    It has been asserted over and over again, by writers who believe in  the immutability of species, that geology yields no linking forms.
 This  assertion, as we shall see in the next chapter, is certainly erroneous.
  As Sir J.
 Lubbock has remarked, "Every species is a link between other  allied forms.
" If we take a genus having a score of species, recent  and extinct, and destroy four-fifths of them, no one doubts that the  remainder will stand much more distinct from each other.
 If the extreme  forms in the genus happen to have been thus destroyed, the genus itself  will stand more distinct from other allied genera.
 What geological  research has not revealed, is the former existence of infinitely  numerous gradations, as fine as existing varieties, connecting together  nearly all existing and extinct species.
 But this ought not to be  expected; yet this has been repeatedly advanced as a most serious  objection against my views.
    It may be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks on the causes  of the imperfection of the geological record under an imaginary  illustration.
 The Malay Archipelago is about the size of Europe from  the North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain to Russia; and  therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined  with any accuracy, excepting those of the United States of America.
 I  fully agree with Mr. Godwin-Austen, that the present condition of the  Malay Archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and  shallow seas, probably represents the former state of Europe, while most  of our formations were accumulating.
 The Malay Archipelago is one of  the richest regions in organic beings; yet if all the species were to  be collected which have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they  represent the natural history of the world!    But we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of  the archipelago would be preserved in an extremely imperfect manner in  the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating.
 Not many  of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked  submarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel or  sand would not endure to a distant epoch.
 Wherever sediment did not  accumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a  sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could  be preserved.
    Formations rich in fossils of many kinds, and of thickness sufficient to  last to an age as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie  in the past, would generally be formed in the archipelago only during  periods of subsidence.
 These periods of subsidence would be separated  from each other by immense intervals of time, during which the area  would be either stationary or rising; whilst rising, the fossiliferous  formations on the steeper shores would be destroyed, almost as soon as  accumulated, by the incessant coast-action, as we now see on the shores  of South America.
 Even throughout the extensive and shallow seas within  the archipelago, sedimentary beds could hardly be accumulated of  great thickness during the periods of elevation, or become capped  and protected by subsequent deposits, so as to have a good chance of  enduring to a very distant future.
 During the periods of subsidence,  there would probably be much extinction of life; during the periods  of elevation, there would be much variation, but the geological record  would then be less perfect.
    It may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of  subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with  a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would EXCEED the average  duration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are  indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations  between any two or more species.
 If such gradations were not all fully  preserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many new,  though closely allied species.
 It is also probable that each great  period of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level,  and that slight climatical changes would intervene during such lengthy  periods; and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would  migrate, and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could  be preserved in any one formation.
    Very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range  thousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy plainly leads to the  belief that it would be chiefly these far-ranging species, though  only some of them, which would oftenest produce new varieties; and  the varieties would at first be local or confined to one place, but  if possessed of any decided advantage, or when further modified and  improved, they would slowly spread and supplant their parent-forms.
 When  such varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they would differ  from their former state in a nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely  slight degree, and as they would be found embedded in slightly  different sub-stages of the same formation, they would, according to  the principles followed by many palaeontologists, be ranked as new and  distinct species.
    If then there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no right  to expect to find, in our geological formations, an infinite number of  those fine transitional forms, which, on our theory, have connected  all the past and present species of the same group into one long and  branching chain of life.
 We ought only to look for a few links, and such  assuredly we do find--some more distantly, some more closely, related  to each other; and these links, let them be ever so close, if found in  different stages of the same formation, would, by many palaeontologists,  be ranked as distinct species.
 But I do not pretend that I should ever  have suspected how poor was the record in the best preserved geological  sections, had not the absence of innumerable transitional links between  the species which lived at the commencement and close of each formation,  pressed so hardly on my theory.
    ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF WHOLE GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES.
    The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in  certain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologists--for  instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the  belief in the transmutation of species.
 If numerous species, belonging  to the same genera or families, have really started into life at once,  the fact would be fatal to the theory of evolution through natural  selection.
 For the development by this means of a group of forms, all  of which are descended from some one progenitor, must have been an  extremely slow process; and the progenitors must have lived long before  their modified descendants.
 But we continually overrate the perfection  of the geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or  families have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not  exist before that stage.
 In all cases positive palaeontological evidence  may be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless, as experience  has so often shown.
 We continually forget how large the world is,  compared with the area over which our geological formations have been  carefully examined; we forget that groups of species may elsewhere  have long existed, and have slowly multiplied, before they invaded the  ancient archipelagoes of Europe and the United States.
 We do not make  due allowance for the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed  between our consecutive formations, longer perhaps in many cases  than the time required for the accumulation of each formation.
 These  intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from  some one parent-form: and in the succeeding formation, such groups or  species will appear as if suddenly created.
    I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely, that it might require  a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar  line of life, for instance, to fly through the air; and consequently  that the transitional forms would often long remain confined to some one  region; but that, when this adaptation had once been effected, and a  few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms,  a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent  forms, which would spread rapidly and widely throughout the world.
  Professor Pictet, in his excellent Review of this work, in commenting  on early transitional forms, and taking birds as an illustration, cannot  see how the successive modifications of the anterior limbs of a supposed  prototype could possibly have been of any advantage.
 But look at the  penguins of the Southern Ocean; have not these birds their front limbs  in this precise intermediate state of "neither true arms nor true  wings?" Yet these birds hold their place victoriously in the battle for  life; for they exist in infinite numbers and of many kinds.
 I do not  suppose that we here see the real transitional grades through which  the wings of birds have passed; but what special difficulty is there in  believing that it might profit the modified descendants of the penguin,  first to become enabled to flap along the surface of the sea like the  logger-headed duck, and ultimately to rise from its surface and glide  through the air?    I will now give a few examples to illustrate the foregoing remarks, and  to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of  species have suddenly been produced.
 Even in so short an interval as  that between the first and second editions of Pictet's great work on  Palaeontology, published in 1844-46 and in 1853-57, the conclusions on  the first appearance and disappearance of several groups of animals  have been considerably modified; and a third edition would require still  further changes.
 I may recall the well-known fact that in geological  treatises, published not many years ago, mammals were always spoken of  as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series.
  And now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs  to the middle of the secondary series; and true mammals have been  discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of  this great series.
 Cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any  tertiary stratum; but now extinct species have been discovered in India,  South America and in Europe, as far back as the miocene stage.
 Had it  not been for the rare accident of the preservation of footsteps in  the new red sandstone of the United States, who would have ventured to  suppose that no less than at least thirty different bird-like animals,  some of gigantic size, existed during that period? Not a fragment of  bone has been discovered in these beds.
 Not long ago, palaeontologists  maintained that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence  during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of Professor  Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper  greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archeopteryx,  with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint,  and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in  the oolitic slates of Solenhofen.
 Hardly any recent discovery shows more  forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants  of the world.
    I may give another instance, which, from having passed under my own eyes  has much struck me.
 In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I stated  that, from the large number of existing and extinct tertiary species;  from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species  all over the world, from the Arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting  various zones of depths, from the upper tidal limits to fifty fathoms;  from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest  tertiary beds; from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve  can be recognised; from all these circumstances, I inferred that, had  sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they would  certainly have been preserved and discovered; and as not one species had  then been discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great  group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary  series.
 This was a sore trouble to me, adding, as I then thought, one  more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species.
 But  my work had hardly been published, when a skilful palaeontologist, M.
  Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakable  sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from the chalk of  Belgium.
 And, as if to make the case as striking as possible, this  cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous genus,  of which not one species has as yet been found even in any tertiary  stratum.
 Still more recently, a Pyrgoma, a member of a distinct  subfamily of sessile cirripedes, has been discovered by Mr. Woodward in  the upper chalk; so that we now have abundant evidence of the existence  of this group of animals during the secondary period.
    The case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the  apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the  teleostean fishes, low down, according to Agassiz, in the Chalk period.
  This group includes the large majority of existing species.
 But certain  Jurassic and Triassic forms are now commonly admitted to be teleostean;  and even some palaeozoic forms have thus been classed by one high  authority.
 If the teleosteans had really appeared suddenly in the  northern hemisphere at the commencement of the chalk formation, the  fact would have been highly remarkable; but it would not have formed an  insuperable difficulty, unless it could likewise have been shown that at  the same period the species were suddenly and simultaneously developed  in other quarters of the world.
 It is almost superfluous to remark  that hardly any fossil-fish are known from south of the equator; and  by running through Pictet's Palaeontology it will be seen that very few  species are known from several formations in Europe.
 Some few families  of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fishes might formerly  have had a similarly confined range, and after having been largely  developed in some one sea, have spread widely.
 Nor have we any right to  suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from  south to north as they are at present.
 Even at this day, if the Malay  Archipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the Indian  Ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any  great group of marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would  remain confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler  climate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or  Australia, and thus reach other and distant seas.
    From these considerations, from our ignorance of the geology of other  countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States, and  from the revolution in our palaeontological knowledge effected by the  discoveries of the last dozen years, it seems to me to be about as rash  to dogmatize on the succession of organic forms throughout the world, as  it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on a barren  point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its  productions.
    ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES IN THE LOWEST KNOWN  FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA.
    There is another and allied difficulty, which is much more serious.
 I  allude to the manner in which species belonging to several of the main  divisions of the animal kingdom suddenly appear in the lowest known  fossiliferous rocks.
 Most of the arguments which have convinced me that  all the existing species of the same group are descended from a single  progenitor, apply with equal force to the earliest known species.
  For instance, it cannot be doubted that all the Cambrian and Silurian  trilobites are descended from some one crustacean, which must have lived  long before the Cambrian age, and which probably differed greatly from  any known animal.
 Some of the most ancient animals, as the Nautilus,  Lingula, etc.
, do not differ much from living species; and it cannot on  our theory be supposed, that these old species were the progenitors of  all the species belonging to the same groups which have subsequently  appeared, for they are not in any degree intermediate in character.
    Consequently, if the theory be true, it is indisputable that before the  lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed, as long as,  or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian age  to the present day; and that during these vast periods the world swarmed  with living creatures.
 Here we encounter a formidable objection; for it  seems doubtful whether the earth, in a fit state for the habitation of  living creatures, has lasted long enough.
 Sir W.
 Thompson concludes that  the consolidation of the crust can hardly have occurred less than twenty  or more than four hundred million years ago, but probably not less than  ninety-eight or more than two hundred million years.
 These very wide  limits show how doubtful the data are; and other elements may have  hereafter to be introduced into the problem.
 Mr. Croll estimates that  about sixty million years have elapsed since the Cambrian period,  but this, judging from the small amount of organic change since the  commencement of the Glacial epoch, appears a very short time for the  many and great mutations of life, which have certainly occurred since  the Cambrian formation; and the previous one hundred and forty million  years can hardly be considered as sufficient for the development of the  varied forms of life which already existed during the Cambrian period.
  It is, however, probable, as Sir William Thompson insists, that the  world at a very early period was subjected to more rapid and violent  changes in its physical conditions than those now occurring; and such  changes would have tended to induce changes at a corresponding rate in  the organisms which then existed.
    To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging  to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can  give no satisfactory answer.
 Several eminent geologists, with Sir R.
  Murchison at their head, were until recently convinced that we beheld  in the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the first dawn  of life.
 Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and E.
 Forbes, have  disputed this conclusion.
 We should not forget that only a small portion  of the world is known with accuracy.
 Not very long ago M.
 Barrande  added another and lower stage, abounding with new and peculiar species,  beneath the then known Silurian system; and now, still lower down in the  Lower Cambrian formation, Mr Hicks has found South Wales beds rich in  trilobites, and containing various molluscs and annelids.
 The presence  of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter, even in some of the  lowest azotic rocks, probably indicates life at these periods; and  the existence of the Eozoon in the Laurentian formation of Canada is  generally admitted.
 There are three great series of strata beneath the  Silurian system in Canada, in the lowest of which the Eozoon is found.
  Sir W.
 Logan states that their "united thickness may possibly far  surpass that of all the succeeding rocks, from the base of the  palaeozoic series to the present time.
 We are thus carried back to a  period so remote, that the appearance of the so-called primordial  fauna (of Barrande) may by some be considered as a comparatively modern  event.
" The Eozoon belongs to the most lowly organised of all classes of  animals, but is highly organised for its class; it existed in countless  numbers, and, as Dr.
 Dawson has remarked, certainly preyed on other  minute organic beings, which must have lived in great numbers.
 Thus the  words, which I wrote in 1859, about the existence of living beings long  before the Cambrian period, and which are almost the same with those  since used by Sir W.
 Logan, have proved true.
 Nevertheless, the  difficulty of assigning any good reason for the absence of vast piles  of strata rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian system is very great.
 It  does not seem probable that the most ancient beds have been quite worn  away by denudation, or that their fossils have been wholly obliterated  by metamorphic action, for if this had been the case we should have  found only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in  age, and these would always have existed in a partially metamorphosed  condition.
 But the descriptions which we possess of the Silurian  deposits over immense territories in Russia and in North America, do not  support the view that the older a formation is the more invariably it  has suffered extreme denudation and metamorphism.
    The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as  a valid argument against the views here entertained.
 To show that it  may hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following  hypothesis.
 From the nature of the organic remains which do not appear  to have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe  and of the United States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in  thickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from  first to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was  derived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the now existing continents  of Europe and North America.
 This same view has since been maintained by  Agassiz and others.
 But we do not know what was the state of things in  the intervals between the several successive formations; whether Europe  and the United States during these intervals existed as dry land, or as  a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not deposited, or  as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea.
    Looking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the  land, we see them studded with many islands; but hardly one truly  oceanic island (with the exception of New Zealand, if this can be called  a truly oceanic island) is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any  palaeozoic or secondary formation.
 Hence, we may perhaps infer, that  during the palaeozoic and secondary periods, neither continents nor  continental islands existed where our oceans now extend; for had they  existed, palaeozoic and secondary formations would in all probability  have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear;  and would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of  level, which must have intervened during these enormously long periods.
  If, then, we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that,  where our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest  period of which we have any record; and on the other hand, that where  continents now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected, no  doubt, to great oscillations of level, since the Cambrian period.
 The  coloured map appended to my volume on Coral Reefs, led me to conclude  that the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great  archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents  areas of elevation.
 But we have no reason to assume that things have  thus remained from the beginning of the world.
 Our continents seem to  have been formed by a preponderance, during many oscillations of  level, of the force of elevation.
 But may not the areas of preponderant  movement have changed in the lapse of ages? At a period long antecedent  to the Cambrian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are  now spread out, and clear and open oceans may have existed where our  continents now stand.
 Nor should we be justified in assuming that if,  for instance, the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted into a  continent we should there find sedimentary formations, in recognisable  condition, older than the Cambrian strata, supposing such to have been  formerly deposited; for it might well happen that strata which had  subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which had  been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might  have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always  remained nearer to the surface.
 The immense areas in some parts of the  world, for instance in South America, of naked metamorphic rocks, which  must have been heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to  require some special explanation; and we may perhaps believe that we see  in these large areas the many formations long anterior to the Cambrian  epoch in a completely metamorphosed and denuded condition.
    The several difficulties here discussed, namely, that, though we find in  our geological formations many links between the species which now exist  and which formerly existed, we do not find infinitely numerous fine  transitional forms closely joining them all together.
 The sudden  manner in which several groups of species first appear in our European  formations, the almost entire absence, as at present known, of  formations rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian strata, are all  undoubtedly of the most serious nature.
 We see this in the fact that  the most eminent palaeontologists, namely, Cuvier, Agassiz, Barrande,  Pictet, Falconer, E.
 Forbes, etc.
, and all our greatest geologists, as  Lyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, etc.
, have unanimously, often vehemently,  maintained the immutability of species.
 But Sir Charles Lyell now  gives the support of his high authority to the opposite side, and most  geologists and palaeontologists are much shaken in their former belief.
  Those who believe that the geological record is in any degree perfect,  will undoubtedly at once reject my theory.
 For my part, following out  Lyell's metaphor, I look at the geological record as a history of  the world imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect.
 Of this  history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three  countries.
 Of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been  preserved, and of each page, only here and there a few lines.
 Each  word of the slowly-changing language, more or less different in the  successive chapters, may represent the forms of life, which are entombed  in our consecutive formations, and which falsely appear to have been  abruptly introduced.
 On this view the difficulties above discussed are  greatly diminished or even disappear.
          .
 ON THE GEOLOGICAL SUCCESSION OF ORGANIC BEINGS.
     On the slow and successive appearance of new species--On their different   rates of change--Species once lost do not reappear--Groups of species   follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as   do single species--On extinction--On simultaneous changes in the forms   of life throughout the world--On the affinities of extinct species to   each other and to living species--On the state of development of   ancient forms--On the succession of the same types within the same   areas--Summary of preceding and present chapters.
      Let us now see whether the several facts and laws relating to the  geological succession of organic beings accord best with the common view  of the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and gradual  modification, through variation and natural selection.
    New species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the  land and in the waters.
 Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to  resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary  stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between the stages,  and to make the proportion between the lost and existing forms more  gradual.
 In some of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high  antiquity if measured by years, only one or two species are extinct,  and only one or two are new, having appeared there for the first time,  either locally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the earth.
 The  secondary formations are more broken; but, as Bronn has remarked,  neither the appearance nor disappearance of the many species embedded in  each formation has been simultaneous.
    Species belonging to different genera and classes have not changed at  the same rate, or in the same degree.
 In the older tertiary beds a few  living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct  forms.
 Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, for an  existing crocodile is associated with many lost mammals and reptiles in  the sub-Himalayan deposits.
 The Silurian Lingula differs but little from  the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian  Molluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly.
 The productions  of the land seem to have changed at a quicker rate than those of the  sea, of which a striking instance has been observed in Switzerland.
  There is some reason to believe that organisms high in the scale, change  more quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to  this rule.
 The amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, is not  the same in each successive so-called formation.
 Yet if we compare any  but the most closely related formations, all the species will be found  to have undergone some change.
 When a species has once disappeared  from the face of the earth, we have no reason to believe that the same  identical form ever reappears.
 The strongest apparent exception to this  latter rule is that of the so-called "colonies" of M.
 Barrande, which  intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation, and then allow  the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell's explanation, namely,  that it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical  province, seems satisfactory.
    These several facts accord well with our theory, which includes no fixed  law of development, causing all the inhabitants of an area to change  abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree.
 The process of  modification must be slow, and will generally affect only a few species  at the same time; for the variability of each species is independent of  that of all others.
 Whether such variations or individual differences as  may arise will be accumulated through natural selection in a greater  or less degree, thus causing a greater or less amount of permanent  modification, will depend on many complex contingencies--on  the variations being of a beneficial nature, on the freedom of  intercrossing, on the slowly changing physical conditions of the  country, on the immigration of new colonists, and on the nature of the  other inhabitants with which the varying species come into competition.
  Hence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain the  same identical form much longer than others; or, if changing, should  change in a less degree.
 We find similar relations between the existing  inhabitants of distinct countries; for instance, the land-shells and  coleopterous insects of Madeira have come to differ considerably from  their nearest allies on the continent of Europe, whereas the marine  shells and birds have remained unaltered.
 We can perhaps understand  the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly  organised productions compared with marine and lower productions, by  the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and  inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter.
 When  many of the inhabitants of any area have become modified and improved,  we can understand, on the principle of competition, and from the  all-important relations of organism to organism in the struggle for  life, that any form which did not become in some degree modified and  improved, would be liable to extermination.
 Hence, we see why all  the species in the same region do at last, if we look to long enough  intervals of time, become modified; for otherwise they would become  extinct.
    In members of the same class the average amount of change, during long  and equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the  accumulation of enduring formations, rich in fossils, depends on great  masses of sediment being deposited on subsiding areas, our formations  have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly  intermittent intervals of time; consequently the amount of organic  change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations  is not equal.
 Each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and  complete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at  hazard, in an ever slowly changing drama.
    We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never  reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and  inorganic, should recur.
 For though the offspring of one species might  be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances)  to fill the place of another species in the economy of nature, and  thus supplant it; yet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be  identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different  characters from their distinct progenitors; and organisms already  differing would vary in a different manner.
 For instance, it is  possible, if all our fantail-pigeons were destroyed, that fanciers might  make a new breed hardly distinguishable from the present breed; but if  the parent rock-pigeon were likewise destroyed, and under nature we have  every reason to believe that parent forms are generally supplanted  and exterminated by their improved offspring, it is incredible that a  fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any  other species of pigeon, or even from any other well established race  of the domestic pigeon, for the successive variations would almost  certainly be in some degree different, and the newly-formed variety  would probably inherit from its progenitor some characteristic  differences.
    Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general  rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species,  changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree.
 A  group, when it has once disappeared, never reappears; that is, its  existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous.
 I am aware that there  are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are  surprisingly few, so few that E.
 Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though  all strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and  the rule strictly accords with the theory.
 For all the species of  the same group, however long it may have lasted, are the modified  descendants one from the other, and all from a common progenitor.
 In  the genus Lingula, for instance, the species which have successively  appeared at all ages must have been connected by an unbroken series of  generations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to the present day.
    We have seen in the last chapter that whole groups of species sometimes  falsely appear to have been abruptly developed; and I have attempted  to give an explanation of this fact, which if true would be fatal to my  views.
 But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being  a gradual increase in number, until the group reaches its maximum, and  then, sooner or later, a gradual decrease.
 If the number of the species  included within a genus, or the number of the genera within a family, be  represented by a vertical line of varying thickness, ascending through  the successive geological formations, in which the species are found,  the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in  a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, often  keeping of equal thickness for a space, and ultimately thins out in the  upper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction of the species.
  This gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly  conformable with the theory; for the species of the same genus, and the  genera of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively;  the process of modification and the production of a number of allied  forms necessarily being a slow and gradual process, one species first  giving rise to two or three varieties, these being slowly converted  into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other  varieties and species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree  from a single stem, till the group becomes large.
    ON EXTINCTION.
    We have as yet only spoken incidentally of the disappearance of species  and of groups of species.
 On the theory of natural selection, the  extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are  intimately connected together.
 The old notion of all the inhabitants of  the earth having been swept away by catastrophes at successive periods  is very generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie de  Beaumont, Murchison, Barrande, etc.
, whose general views would naturally  lead them to this conclusion.
 On the contrary, we have every reason to  believe, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and  groups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one  spot, then from another, and finally from the world.
 In some few cases,  however, as by the breaking of an isthmus and the consequent irruption  of a multitude of new inhabitants into an adjoining sea, or by the final  subsidence of an island, the process of extinction may have been rapid.
  Both single species and whole groups of species last for very unequal  periods; some groups, as we have seen, have endured from the earliest  known dawn of life to the present day; some have disappeared before  the close of the palaeozoic period.
 No fixed law seems to determine  the length of time during which any single species or any single genus  endures.
 There is reason to believe that the extinction of a whole group  of species is generally a slower process than their production: if their  appearance and disappearance be represented, as before, by a vertical  line of varying thickness the line is found to taper more gradually at  its upper end, which marks the progress of extermination, than at its  lower end, which marks the first appearance and the early increase in  number of the species.
 In some cases, however, the extermination of  whole groups, as of ammonites, towards the close of the secondary  period, has been wonderfully sudden.
    The extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous  mystery.
 Some authors have even supposed that, as the individual has a  definite length of life, so have species a definite duration.
 No one can  have marvelled more than I have done at the extinction of species.
 When  I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of  Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon and other extinct monsters, which all  co-existed with still living shells at a very late geological period,  I was filled with astonishment; for, seeing that the horse, since its  introduction by the Spaniards into South America, has run wild over the  whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate, I  asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse  under conditions of life apparently so favourable.
 But my astonishment  was groundless.
 Professor Owen soon perceived that the tooth, though  so like that of the existing horse, belonged to an extinct species.
 Had  this horse been still living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist  would have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the  attribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all countries.
  If we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer that  something is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that  something is, we can hardly ever tell.
 On the supposition of the fossil  horse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain, from  the analogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant,  and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in  South America, that under more favourable conditions it would in a very  few years have stocked the whole continent.
 But we could not have  told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase,  whether some one or several contingencies, and at what period of the  horse's life, and in what degree they severally acted.
 If the conditions  had gone on, however slowly, becoming less and less favourable, we  assuredly should not have perceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would  certainly have become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct--its place  being seized on by some more successful competitor.
    It is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every  living creature is constantly being checked by unperceived hostile  agencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient  to cause rarity, and finally extinction.
 So little is this subject  understood, that I have heard surprise repeatedly expressed at such  great monsters as the Mastodon and the more ancient Dinosaurians having  become extinct; as if mere bodily strength gave victory in the battle of  life.
 Mere size, on the contrary, would in some cases determine, as has  been remarked by Owen, quicker extermination, from the greater amount  of requisite food.
 Before man inhabited India or Africa, some cause must  have checked the continued increase of the existing elephant.
 A highly  capable judge, Dr.
 Falconer, believes that it is chiefly insects which,  from incessantly harassing and weakening the elephant in India, check  its increase; and this was Bruce's conclusion with respect to  the African elephant in Abyssinia.
 It is certain that insects and  blood-sucking bats determine the existence of the larger naturalised  quadrupeds in several parts of South America.
    We see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations that rarity  precedes extinction; and we know that this has been the progress of  events with those animals which have been exterminated, either locally  or wholly, through man's agency.
 I may repeat what I published in 1845,  namely, that to admit that species generally become rare before they  become extinct--to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet  to marvel greatly when the species ceases to exist, is much the same as  to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death--to  feel no surprise at sickness, but, when the sick man dies, to wonder and  to suspect that he died by some deed of violence.
    The theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new  variety and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by  having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition;  and the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably  follows.
 It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and  slightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the  less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it  is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the  place of other breeds in other countries.
 Thus the appearance of new  forms and the disappearance of old forms, both those naturally and  artificially produced, are bound together.
 In flourishing groups, the  number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given  time has at some periods probably been greater than the number of  the old specific forms which have been exterminated; but we know that  species have not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least during the  later geological epochs, so that, looking to later times, we may believe  that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the  same number of old forms.
    The competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained  and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each  other in all respects.
 Hence the improved and modified descendants of  a species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species;  and if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the  nearest allies of that species, i.
e.
 the species of the same genus, will  be the most liable to extermination.
 Thus, as I believe, a number of  new species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to  supplant an old genus, belonging to the same family.
 But it must often  have happened that a new species belonging to some one group has seized  on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group, and  thus have caused its extermination.
 If many allied forms be developed  from the successful intruder, many will have to yield their places;  and it will generally be the allied forms, which will suffer from some  inherited inferiority in common.
 But whether it be species belonging  to the same or to a distinct class, which have yielded their places to  other modified and improved species, a few of the sufferers may often  be preserved for a long time, from being fitted to some peculiar line of  life, or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they  will have escaped severe competition.
 For instance, some species of  Trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary formations, survive  in the Australian seas; and a few members of the great and almost  extinct group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters.
  Therefore, the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have  seen, a slower process than its production.
    With respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or  orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic period, and of  Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what  has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our  consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been  much slow extermination.
 Moreover, when, by sudden immigration or by  unusually rapid development, many species of a new group have taken  possession of an area, many of the older species will have been  exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner; and the forms which thus  yield their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of the  same inferiority in common.
    Thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole  groups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of natural  selection.
 We need not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel, let it  be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand  the many complex contingencies on which the existence of each species  depends.
 If we forget for an instant that each species tends to increase  inordinately, and that some check is always in action, yet seldom  perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured.
  Whenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant  in individuals than that; why this species and not another can be  naturalised in a given country; then, and not until then, we may justly  feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of any particular  species or group of species.
    ON THE FORMS OF LIFE CHANGING ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE  WORLD.
    Scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact  that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the  world.
 Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many  distant regions, under the most different climates, where not a fragment  of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North America, in  equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope,  and in the peninsula of India.
 For at these distant points, the organic  remains in certain beds present an unmistakable resemblance to those  of the Chalk.
 It is not that the same species are met with; for in some  cases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to  the same families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are  similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial  sculpture.
 Moreover, other forms, which are not found in the Chalk of  Europe, but which occur in the formations either above or below, occur  in the same order at these distant points of the world.
 In the several  successive palaeozoic formations of Russia, Western Europe and North  America, a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed  by several authors; so it is, according to Lyell, with the European and  North American tertiary deposits.
 Even if the few fossil species which  are common to the Old and New Worlds were kept wholly out of view, the  general parallelism in the successive forms of life, in the palaeozoic  and tertiary stages, would still be manifest, and the several formations  could be easily correlated.
    These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of the  world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions  of the land and of fresh water at distant points change in the same  parallel manner.
 We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the  Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought  to Europe from La Plata, without any information in regard to their  geological position, no one would have suspected that they had  co-existed with sea-shells all still living; but as these anomalous  monsters co-existed with the Mastodon and Horse, it might at least  have been inferred that they had lived during one of the later tertiary  stages.
    When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed  simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this  expression relates to the same year, or even to the same century, or  even that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine  animals now living in Europe, and all those that lived in Europe during  the pleistocene period (a very remote period as measured by years,  including the whole glacial epoch) were compared with those now existing  in South America or in Australia, the most skilful naturalist would  hardly be able to say whether the present or the pleistocene inhabitants  of Europe resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere.
 So,  again, several highly competent observers maintain that the existing  productions of the United States are more closely related to those which  lived in Europe during certain late tertiary stages, than to the  present inhabitants of Europe; and if this be so, it is evident that  fossiliferous beds now deposited on the shores of North America would  hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older European beds.
  Nevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch, there can be little  doubt that all the more modern MARINE formations, namely, the upper  pliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds of Europe, North and  South America, and Australia, from containing fossil remains in some  degree allied, and from not including those forms which are found  only in the older underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as  simultaneous in a geological sense.
    The fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the above large  sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those admirable  observers, MM.
 de Verneuil and d'Archiac.
 After referring to the  parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various parts of Europe,  they add, "If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our attention to  North America, and there discover a series of analogous phenomena,  it will appear certain that all these modifications of species, their  extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere  changes in marine currents or other causes more or less local and  temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole animal  kingdom.
" M.
 Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same  effect.
 It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents,  climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great  mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most  different climates.
 We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to some  special law.
 We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present  distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation  between the physical conditions of various countries and the nature of  their inhabitants.
    This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life  throughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection.
  New species are formed by having some advantage over older forms; and  the forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage over the  other forms in their own country, give birth to the greatest number of  new varieties or incipient species.
 We have distinct evidence on this  head, in the plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest and  most widely diffused, producing the greatest number of new varieties.
  It is also natural that the dominant, varying and far-spreading species,  which have already invaded, to a certain extent, the territories of  other species, should be those which would have the best chance of  spreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to other  new varieties and species.
 The process of diffusion would often be  very slow, depending on climatal and geographical changes, on strange  accidents, and on the gradual acclimatization of new species to the  various climates through which they might have to pass, but in the  course of time the dominant forms would generally succeed in spreading  and would ultimately prevail.
 The diffusion would, it is probable, be  slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with  the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea.
 We might therefore expect  to find, as we do find, a less strict degree of parallelism in the  succession of the productions of the land than with those of the sea.
    Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense,  simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world,  accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by  dominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus  produced being themselves dominant, owing to their having had some  advantage over their already dominant parents, as well as over other  species; and again spreading, varying, and producing new forms.
 The  old forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and  victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting  some inferiority in common; and, therefore, as new and improved groups  spread throughout the world, old groups disappear from the world; and  the succession of forms everywhere tends to correspond both in their  first appearance and final disappearance.
    There is one other remark connected with this subject worth making.
 I  have given my reasons for believing that most of our great formations,  rich in fossils, were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that  blank intervals of vast duration, as far as fossils are concerned,  occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either  stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not thrown down  quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains.
 During these  long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each region  underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and  that there was much migration from other parts of the world.
 As we have  reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement,  it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been  accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world;  but we are very far from having any right to conclude that this has  invariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been  affected by the same movements.
 When two formations have been deposited  in two regions during nearly, but not exactly, the same period,  we should find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing  paragraphs, the same general succession in the forms of life; but the  species would not exactly correspond; for there will have been a  little more time in the one region than in the other for modification,  extinction, and immigration.
    I suspect that cases of this nature occur in Europe.
 Mr. Prestwich, in  his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France, is  able to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages  in the two countries; but when he compares certain stages in England  with those in France, although he finds in both a curious accordance in  the numbers of the species belonging to the same genera, yet the species  themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for considering  the proximity of the two areas, unless, indeed, it be assumed that an  isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous  faunas.
 Lyell has made similar observations on some of the later  tertiary formations.
 Barrande, also, shows that there is a striking  general parallelism in the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia and  Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in  the species.
 If the several formations in these regions have not been  deposited during the same exact periods--a formation in one region often  corresponding with a blank interval in the other--and if in both regions  the species have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the  several formations and during the long intervals of time between them;  in this case the several formations in the two regions could be arranged  in the same order, in accordance with the general succession of the  forms of life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly  parallel; nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the  apparently corresponding stages in the two regions.
    ON THE AFFINITIES OF EXTINCT SPECIES TO EACH OTHER, AND TO LIVING FORMS.
    Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species.
  All fall into a few grand classes; and this fact is at once explained on  the principle of descent.
 The more ancient any form is, the more, as a  general rule, it differs from living forms.
 But, as Buckland long ago  remarked, extinct species can all be classed either in still existing  groups, or between them.
 That the extinct forms of life help to fill  up the intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, is  certainly true; but as this statement has often been ignored or even  denied, it may be well to make some remarks on this subject, and to give  some instances.
 If we confine our attention either to the living or to  the extinct species of the same class, the series is far less perfect  than if we combine both into one general system.
 In the writings of  Professor Owen we continually meet with the expression of generalised  forms, as applied to extinct animals; and in the writings of Agassiz, of  prophetic or synthetic types; and these terms imply that such forms  are, in fact, intermediate or connecting links.
 Another distinguished  palaeontologist, M.
 Gaudry, has shown in the most striking manner that  many of the fossil mammals discovered by him in Attica serve to break  down the intervals between existing genera.
 Cuvier ranked the Ruminants  and Pachyderms as two of the most distinct orders of mammals; but so  many fossil links have been disentombed that Owen has had to alter the  whole classification, and has placed certain Pachyderms in the same  sub-order with ruminants; for example, he dissolves by gradations the  apparently wide interval between the pig and the camel.
 The Ungulata  or hoofed quadrupeds are now divided into the even-toed or odd-toed  divisions; but the Macrauchenia of South America connects to a certain  extent these two grand divisions.
 No one will deny that the Hipparion  is intermediate between the existing horse and certain other ungulate  forms.
 What a wonderful connecting link in the chain of mammals is the  Typotherium from South America, as the name given to it by Professor  Gervais expresses, and which cannot be placed in any existing order.
 The  Sirenia form a very distinct group of the mammals, and one of the most  remarkable peculiarities in existing dugong and lamentin is the entire  absence of hind limbs, without even a rudiment being left; but the  extinct Halitherium had, according to Professor Flower, an ossified  thigh-bone "articulated to a well-defined acetabulum in the pelvis," and  it thus makes some approach to ordinary hoofed quadrupeds, to which the  Sirenia are in other respects allied.
 The cetaceans or whales are  widely different from all other mammals, but the tertiary Zeuglodon and  Squalodon, which have been placed by some naturalists in an order  by themselves, are considered by Professor Huxley to be undoubtedly  cetaceans, "and to constitute connecting links with the aquatic  carnivora.
"    Even the wide interval between birds and reptiles has been shown by  the naturalist just quoted to be partially bridged over in the  most unexpected manner, on the one hand, by the ostrich and extinct  Archeopteryx, and on the other hand by the Compsognathus, one of  the Dinosaurians--that group which includes the most gigantic of all  terrestrial reptiles.
 Turning to the Invertebrata, Barrande asserts, a  higher authority could not be named, that he is every day taught that,  although palaeozoic animals can certainly be classed under existing  groups, yet that at this ancient period the groups were not so  distinctly separated from each other as they now are.
    Some writers have objected to any extinct species, or group of species,  being considered as intermediate between any two living species, or  groups of species.
 If by this term it is meant that an extinct form is  directly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms or  groups, the objection is probably valid.
 But in a natural classification  many fossil species certainly stand between living species, and some  extinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to  distinct families.
 The most common case, especially with respect to very  distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be that, supposing  them to be distinguished at the present day by a score of characters,  the ancient members are separated by a somewhat lesser number of  characters, so that the two groups formerly made a somewhat nearer  approach to each other than they now do.
    It is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the  more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely  separated from each other.
 This remark no doubt must be restricted  to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of  geological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the truth of  the proposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the  Lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very  distinct groups.
 Yet if we compare the older Reptiles and Batrachians,  the older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the  recent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is truth in  the remark.
    Let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the  theory of descent with modification.
 As the subject is somewhat complex,  I must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter.
  We may suppose that the numbered letters in italics represent genera,  and the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus.
 The  diagram is much too simple, too few genera and too few species being  given, but this is unimportant for us.
 The horizontal lines may  represent successive geological formations, and all the forms beneath  the uppermost line may be considered as extinct.
 The three existing  genera, a14, q14, p14, will form a small family; b14 and f14, a closely  allied family or subfamily; and o14, i14, m14, a third family.
 These  three families, together with the many extinct genera on the several  lines of descent diverging from the parent form (A) will form an order;  for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient  progenitor.
 On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence  of character, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more  recent any form is the more it will generally differ from its ancient  progenitor.
 Hence, we can understand the rule that the most ancient  fossils differ most from existing forms.
 We must not, however, assume  that divergence of character is a necessary contingency; it depends  solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize  on many and different places in the economy of nature.
 Therefore it is  quite possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms,  that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its  slightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast  period the same general characteristics.
 This is represented in the  diagram by the letter F14.
    All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as  before remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects  of extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into  several sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have  perished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present  day.
    By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms  supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered  at several points low down in the series, the three existing families on  the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other.
 If,  for instance, the genera a1, a5, a10, f8, m3, m6, m9, were disinterred,  these three families would be so closely linked together that they  probably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the  same manner as has occurred with ruminants and certain pachyderms.
 Yet  he who objected to consider as intermediate the extinct genera, which  thus link together the living genera of three families, would be partly  justified, for they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long  and circuitous course through many widely different forms.
 If many  extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal  lines or geological formations--for instance, above No.
 VI.
--but none  from beneath this line, then only two of the families (those on the left  hand a14, etc.
, and b14, etc.
) would have to be united into one; and  there would remain two families which would be less distinct from each  other than they were before the discovery of the fossils.
 So again, if  the three families formed of eight genera (a14 to m14), on the uppermost  line, be supposed to differ from each other by half-a-dozen important  characters, then the families which existed at a period marked VI would  certainly have differed from each other by a less number of characters;  for they would at this early stage of descent have diverged in a less  degree from their common progenitor.
 Thus it comes that ancient and  extinct genera are often in a greater or less degree intermediate  in character between their modified descendants, or between their  collateral relations.
    Under nature the process will be far more complicated than is  represented in the diagram; for the groups will have been more numerous;  they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will  have been modified in various degrees.
 As we possess only the last  volume of the geological record, and that in a very broken condition,  we have no right to expect, except in rare cases, to fill up the wide  intervals in the natural system, and thus to unite distinct families or  orders.
 All that we have a right to expect is, that those groups which  have, within known geological periods, undergone much modification,  should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other;  so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of  their characters than do the existing members of the same groups;  and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists is  frequently the case.
    Thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with  respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each  other and to living forms, are explained in a satisfactory manner.
 And  they are wholly inexplicable on any other view.
    On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna during any one great  period in the earth's history will be intermediate in general character  between that which preceded and that which succeeded it.
 Thus the  species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram  are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and  are the parents of those which became still more modified at the  seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in  character between the forms of life above and below.
 We must, however,  allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and in any one  region for the immigration of new forms from other regions, and for a  large amount of modification during the long and blank intervals between  the successive formations.
 Subject to these allowances, the fauna of  each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between  the preceding and succeeding faunas.
 I need give only one instance,  namely, the manner in which the fossils of the Devonian system,  when this system was first discovered, were at once recognised by  palaeontologists as intermediate in character between those of the  overlying carboniferous and underlying Silurian systems.
 But each fauna  is not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time  have elapsed between consecutive formations.
    It is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna of  each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the  preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions  to the rule.
 For instance, the species of mastodons and elephants, when  arranged by Dr.
 Falconer in two series--in the first place according  to their mutual affinities, and in the second place according to their  periods of existence--do not accord in arrangement.
 The species extreme  in character are not the oldest or the most recent; nor are those which  are intermediate in character, intermediate in age.
 But supposing for  an instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first  appearance and disappearance of the species was complete, which is far  from the case, we have no reason to believe that forms successively  produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time.
 A very  ancient form may occasionally have lasted much longer than a form  elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial  productions inhabiting separated districts.
 To compare small things with  great; if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon  were arranged in serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely  accord with the order in time of their production, and even less with  the order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon still  lives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier  have become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important  character of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked  tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series in this respect.
    Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an  intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character,  is the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that fossils from two  consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than  are the fossils from two remote formations.
 Pictet gives as a well-known  instance, the general resemblance of the organic remains from the  several stages of the Chalk formation, though the species are distinct  in each stage.
 This fact alone, from its generality, seems to have  shaken Professor Pictet in his belief in the immutability of species.
  He who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over the  globe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of distinct  species in closely consecutive formations, by the physical conditions of  the ancient areas having remained nearly the same.
 Let it be remembered  that the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the sea, have changed  almost simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore under the most  different climates and conditions.
 Consider the prodigious vicissitudes  of climate during the pleistocene period, which includes the whole  glacial epoch, and note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants  of the sea have been affected.
    On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fossil remains from  closely consecutive formations, being closely related, though ranked as  distinct species, is obvious.
 As the accumulation of each formation  has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened  between successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as  I attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or in any two  formations, all the intermediate varieties between the species which  appeared at the commencement and close of these periods: but we ought  to find after intervals, very long as measured by years, but only  moderately long as measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as  they have been called by some authors, representative species; and these  assuredly we do find.
 We find, in short, such evidence of the slow and  scarcely sensible mutations of specific forms, as we have the right to  expect.
    ON THE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF ANCIENT COMPARED WITH LIVING FORMS.
    We have seen in the fourth chapter that the degree of differentiation  and specialisation of the parts in organic beings, when arrived at  maturity, is the best standard, as yet suggested, of their degree of  perfection or highness.
 We have also seen that, as the specialisation of  parts is an advantage to each being, so natural selection will tend to  render the organisation of each being more specialised and perfect,  and in this sense higher; not but that it may leave many creatures with  simple and unimproved structures fitted for simple conditions of life,  and in some cases will even degrade or simplify the organisation, yet  leaving such degraded beings better fitted for their new walks of life.
  In another and more general manner, new species become superior to their  predecessors; for they have to beat in the struggle for life all  the older forms, with which they come into close competition.
 We may  therefore conclude that if under a nearly similar climate the eocene  inhabitants of the world could be put into competition with the existing  inhabitants, the former would be beaten and exterminated by the  latter, as would the secondary by the eocene, and the palaeozoic by  the secondary forms.
 So that by this fundamental test of victory in the  battle for life, as well as by the standard of the specialisation of  organs, modern forms ought, on the theory of natural selection, to  stand higher than ancient forms.
 Is this the case? A large majority of  palaeontologists would answer in the affirmative; and it seems that this  answer must be admitted as true, though difficult of proof.
    It is no valid objection to this conclusion, that certain Brachiopods  have been but slightly modified from an extremely remote geological  epoch; and that certain land and fresh-water shells have remained nearly  the same, from the time when, as far as is known, they first appeared.
  It is not an insuperable difficulty that Foraminifera have not, as  insisted on by Dr.
 Carpenter, progressed in organisation since even the  Laurentian epoch; for some organisms would have to remain fitted for  simple conditions of life, and what could be better fitted for this end  than these lowly organised Protozoa? Such objections as the above  would be fatal to my view, if it included advance in organisation as  a necessary contingent.
 They would likewise be fatal, if the above  Foraminifera, for instance, could be proved to have first come into  existence during the Laurentian epoch, or the above Brachiopods during  the Cambrian formation; for in this case, there would not have been time  sufficient for the development of these organisms up to the standard  which they had then reached.
 When advanced up to any given point, there  is no necessity, on the theory of natural selection, for their further  continued process; though they will, during each successive age, have to  be slightly modified, so as to hold their places in relation to slight  changes in their conditions.
 The foregoing objections hinge on the  question whether we really know how old the world is, and at what period  the various forms of life first appeared; and this may well be disputed.
    The problem whether organisation on the whole has advanced is in  many ways excessively intricate.
 The geological record, at all times  imperfect, does not extend far enough back to show with unmistakable  clearness that within the known history of the world organisation has  largely advanced.
 Even at the present day, looking to members of the  same class, naturalists are not unanimous which forms ought to be ranked  as highest: thus, some look at the selaceans or sharks, from their  approach in some important points of structure to reptiles, as the  highest fish; others look at the teleosteans as the highest.
 The ganoids  stand intermediate between the selaceans and teleosteans; the latter  at the present day are largely preponderant in number; but formerly  selaceans and ganoids alone existed; and in this case, according to  the standard of highness chosen, so will it be said that fishes have  advanced or retrograded in organisation.
 To attempt to compare members  of distinct types in the scale of highness seems hopeless; who will  decide whether a cuttle-fish be higher than a bee--that insect which  the great Von Baer believed to be "in fact more highly organised than a  fish, although upon another type?" In the complex struggle for life it  is quite credible that crustaceans, not very high in their own class,  might beat cephalopods, the highest molluscs; and such crustaceans,  though not highly developed, would stand very high in the scale of  invertebrate animals, if judged by the most decisive of all trials--the  law of battle.
 Beside these inherent difficulties in deciding which  forms are the most advanced in organisation, we ought not solely to  compare the highest members of a class at any two periods--though  undoubtedly this is one and perhaps the most important element in  striking a balance--but we ought to compare all the members, high  and low, at two periods.
 At an ancient epoch the highest and lowest  molluscoidal animals, namely, cephalopods and brachiopods, swarmed in  numbers; at the present time both groups are greatly reduced,  while others, intermediate in organisation, have largely increased;  consequently some naturalists maintain that molluscs were formerly more  highly developed than at present; but a stronger case can be made out on  the opposite side, by considering the vast reduction of brachiopods, and  the fact that our existing cephalopods, though few in number, are more  highly organised than their ancient representatives.
 We ought also to  compare the relative proportional numbers, at any two periods, of the  high and low classes throughout the world: if, for instance, at the  present day fifty thousand kinds of vertebrate animals exist, and if  we knew that at some former period only ten thousand kinds existed, we  ought to look at this increase in number in the highest class, which  implies a great displacement of lower forms, as a decided advance in the  organisation of the world.
 We thus see how hopelessly difficult it is to  compare with perfect fairness, under such extremely complex relations,  the standard of organisation of the imperfectly-known faunas of  successive periods.
    We shall appreciate this difficulty more clearly by looking to certain  existing faunas and floras.
 From the extraordinary manner in which  European productions have recently spread over New Zealand, and have  seized on places which must have been previously occupied by the  indigenes, we must believe, that if all the animals and plants of Great  Britain were set free in New Zealand, a multitude of British forms would  in the course of time become thoroughly naturalized there, and would  exterminate many of the natives.
 On the other hand, from the fact that  hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere has become wild in  any part of Europe, we may well doubt whether, if all the productions  of New Zealand were set free in Great Britain, any considerable number  would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native plants  and animals.
 Under this point of view, the productions of Great Britain  stand much higher in the scale than those of New Zealand.
 Yet the  most skilful naturalist, from an examination of the species of the two  countries, could not have foreseen this result.
    Agassiz and several other highly competent judges insist that ancient  animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals  belonging to the same classes; and that the geological succession of  extinct forms is nearly parallel with the embryological development of  existing forms.
 This view accords admirably well with our theory.
 In a  future  shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its  embryo, owing to variations having supervened at a not early age, and  having been inherited at a corresponding age.
 This process, whilst it  leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of  successive generations, more and more difference to the adult.
 Thus the  embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of  the former and less modified condition of the species.
 This view may be  true, and yet may never be capable of proof.
 Seeing, for instance, that  the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fishes strictly belong to their  proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree  less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same  groups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having  the common embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds rich  in fossils are discovered far beneath the lowest Cambrian strata--a  discovery of which the chance is small.
    ON THE SUCCESSION OF THE SAME TYPES WITHIN THE SAME AREAS, DURING THE  LATER TERTIARY PERIODS.
    Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the  Australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that  continent.
 In South America, a similar relationship is manifest, even to  an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour, like those of the  armadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen has  shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals,  buried there in such numbers, are related to South American types.
 This  relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of  fossil bones made by MM.
 Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil.
 I was  so much impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839  and 1845, on this "law of the succession of types,"--on "this wonderful  relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living.
"  Professor Owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to  the mammals of the Old World.
 We see the same law in this author's  restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of New Zealand.
 We see  it also in the birds of the caves of Brazil.
 Mr. Woodward has shown that  the same law holds good with sea-shells, but, from the wide distribution  of most molluscs, it is not well displayed by them.
 Other cases could  be added, as the relation between the extinct and living land-shells of  Madeira; and between the extinct and living brackish water-shells of the  Aralo-Caspian Sea.
    Now, what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types  within the same areas mean? He would be a bold man who, after comparing  the present climate of Australia and of parts of South America, under  the same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand through  dissimilar physical conditions, for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants  of these two continents; and, on the other hand through similarity  of conditions, for the uniformity of the same types in each continent  during the later tertiary periods.
 Nor can it be pretended that it is  an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely  produced in Australia; or that Edentata and other American types should  have been solely produced in South America.
 For we know that Europe in  ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials; and I have shown  in the publications above alluded to, that in America the law of  distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it  now is.
 North America formerly partook strongly of the present character  of the southern half of the continent; and the southern half was  formerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern  half.
 In a similar manner we know, from Falconer and Cautley's  discoveries, that Northern India was formerly more closely related in  its mammals to Africa than it is at the present time.
 Analogous facts  could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals.
    On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long  enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the  same areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each quarter of  the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the next  succeeding period of time, closely allied though in some degree modified  descendants.
 If the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed  greatly from those of another continent, so will their modified  descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree.
 But  after very long intervals of time, and after great geographical changes,  permitting much intermigration, the feebler will yield to the more  dominant forms, and there will be nothing immutable in the distribution  of organic beings.
    It may be asked in ridicule whether I suppose that the megatherium and  other allied huge monsters, which formerly lived in South America, have  left behind them the sloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their degenerate  descendants.
 This cannot for an instant be admitted.
 These huge animals  have become wholly extinct, and have left no progeny.
 But in the caves  of Brazil there are many extinct species which are closely allied in  size and in all other characters to the species still living in South  America; and some of these fossils may have been the actual progenitors  of the living species.
 It must not be forgotten that, on our theory, all  the species of the same genus are the descendants of some one species;  so that, if six genera, each having eight species, be found in one  geological formation, and in a succeeding formation there be six other  allied or representative genera, each with the same number of species,  then we may conclude that generally only one species of each of the  older genera has left modified descendants, which constitute the new  genera containing the several species; the other seven species of each  old genus having died out and left no progeny.
 Or, and this will be a  far commoner case, two or three species in two or three alone of the six  older genera will be the parents of the new genera: the other species  and the other old genera having become utterly extinct.
 In failing  orders, with the genera and species decreasing in numbers as is the case  with the Edentata of South America, still fewer genera and species will  leave modified blood-descendants.
    SUMMARY OF THE PRECEDING AND PRESENT CHAPTERS.
    I have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely  imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically  explored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have  been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of  specimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as  nothing compared with the number of generations which must have passed  away even during a single formation; that, owing to subsidence being  almost necessary for the accumulation of deposits rich in fossil species  of many kinds, and thick enough to outlast future degradation, great  intervals of time must have elapsed between most of our successive  formations; that there has probably been more extinction during  the periods of subsidence, and more variation during the periods  of elevation, and during the latter the record will have been least  perfectly kept; that each single formation has not been continuously  deposited; that the duration of each formation is probably short  compared with the average duration of specific forms; that migration has  played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any  one area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which have  varied most frequently, and have oftenest given rise to new species;  that varieties have at first been local; and lastly, although each  species must have passed through numerous transitional stages, it is  probable that the periods, during which each underwent modification,  though many and long as measured by years, have been short in comparison  with the periods during which each remained in an unchanged condition.
  These causes, taken conjointly, will to a large extent explain  why--though we do find many links--we do not find interminable  varieties, connecting together all extinct and existing forms by the  finest graduated steps.
 It should also be constantly borne in mind that  any linking variety between two forms, which might be found, would be  ranked, unless the whole chain could be perfectly restored, as a new  and distinct species; for it is not pretended that we have any sure  criterion by which species and varieties can be discriminated.
    He who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological record,  will rightly reject the whole theory.
 For he may ask in vain where are  the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the  closely allied or representative species, found in the successive stages  of the same great formation? He may disbelieve in the immense intervals  of time which must have elapsed between our consecutive formations;  he may overlook how important a part migration has played, when the  formations of any one great region, as those of Europe, are considered;  he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden coming in  of whole groups of species.
 He may ask where are the remains of those  infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the  Cambrian system was deposited? We now know that at least one animal did  then exist; but I can answer this last question only by supposing that  where our oceans now extend they have extended for an enormous period,  and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood since the  commencement of the Cambrian system; but that, long before that epoch,  the world presented a widely different aspect; and that the older  continents, formed of formations older than any known to us, exist now  only as remnants in a metamorphosed condition, or lie still buried under  the ocean.
    Passing from these difficulties, the other great leading facts  in palaeontology agree admirably with the theory of descent with  modification through variation and natural selection.
 We can thus  understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively;  how species of different classes do not necessarily change together, or  at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all  undergo modification to some extent.
 The extinction of old forms is the  almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms.
 We can  understand why, when a species has once disappeared, it never reappears.
  Groups of species increase in numbers slowly, and endure for unequal  periods of time; for the process of modification is necessarily  slow, and depends on many complex contingencies.
 The dominant species  belonging to large and dominant groups tend to leave many modified  descendants, which form new sub-groups and groups.
 As these are  formed, the species of the less vigorous groups, from their inferiority  inherited from a common progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and  to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth.
 But the  utter extinction of a whole group of species has sometimes been a slow  process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected  and isolated situations.
 When a group has once wholly disappeared, it  does not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken.
    We can understand how it is that dominant forms which spread widely and  yield the greatest number of varieties tend to people the world with  allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed  in displacing the groups which are their inferiors in the struggle for  existence.
 Hence, after long intervals of time, the productions of the  world appear to have changed simultaneously.
    We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and  recent, make together a few grand classes.
 We can understand, from the  continued tendency to divergence of character, why the more ancient  a form is, the more it generally differs from those now living.
 Why  ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing  forms, sometimes blending two groups, previously classed as distinct  into one; but more commonly bringing them only a little closer together.
  The more ancient a form is, the more often it stands in some degree  intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form  is, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble,  the common progenitor of groups, since become widely divergent.
 Extinct  forms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms; but are  intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through other extinct  and different forms.
 We can clearly see why the organic remains of  closely consecutive formations are closely allied; for they are closely  linked together by generation.
 We can clearly see why the remains of an  intermediate formation are intermediate in character.
    The inhabitants of the world at each successive period in its history  have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so  far, higher in the scale, and their structure has generally become more  specialised; and this may account for the common belief held by so many  palaeontologists, that organisation on the whole has progressed.
 Extinct  and ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of the more  recent animals belonging to the same classes, and this wonderful fact  receives a simple explanation according to our views.
 The succession  of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later  geological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is intelligible on the  principle of inheritance.
    If, then, the geological record be as imperfect as many believe, and  it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much  more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection are  greatly diminished or disappear.
 On the other hand, all the chief laws  of palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have  been produced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted  by new and improved forms of life, the products of variation and the  survival of the fittest.
          .
 GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.
     Present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical   conditions--Importance of barriers--Affinity of the productions of the   same continent--Centres of creation--Means of dispersal by changes of   climate and of the level of the land, and by occasional means--Dispersal   during the Glacial period--Alternate Glacial periods in the North and   South.
      In considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of  the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the  similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions  can be wholly accounted for by climatal and other physical conditions.
  Of late, almost every author who has studied the subject has come to  this conclusion.
 The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove  its truth; for if we exclude the arctic and northern temperate parts,  all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in  geographical distribution is that between the New and Old Worlds; yet  if we travel over the vast American continent, from the central parts of  the United States to its extreme southern point, we meet with the most  diversified conditions; humid districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains,  grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes and great rivers, under almost  every temperature.
 There is hardly a climate or condition in the Old  World which cannot be paralleled in the New--at least so closely as the  same species generally require.
 No doubt small areas can be pointed out  in the Old World hotter than any in the New World; but these are not  inhabited by a fauna different from that of the surrounding districts;  for it is rare to find a group of organisms confined to a small area,  of which the conditions are peculiar in only a slight degree.
  Notwithstanding this general parallelism in the conditions of Old and  New Worlds, how widely different are their living productions!    In the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in  Australia, South Africa, and western South America, between latitudes  25 and 35 degrees, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their  conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas  and floras more utterly dissimilar.
 Or, again, we may compare the  productions of South America south of latitude 35 degrees with those  north of 25 degrees, which consequently are separated by a space of  ten degrees of latitude, and are exposed to considerably different  conditions; yet they are incomparably more closely related to each other  than they are to the productions of Australia or Africa under nearly  the same climate.
 Analogous facts could be given with respect to the  inhabitants of the sea.
    A second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that  barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a  close and important manner to the differences between the productions of  various regions.
 We see this in the great difference in nearly all the  terrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, excepting in the  northern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a slightly  different climate, there might have been free migration for the northern  temperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic productions.
  We see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of  Australia, Africa, and South America under the same latitude; for these  countries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible.
 On  each continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of  lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts and even of  large rivers, we find different productions; though as mountain chains,  deserts, etc.
, are not as impassable, or likely to have endured so long,  as the oceans separating continents, the differences are very inferior  in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents.
    Turning to the sea, we find the same law.
 The marine inhabitants of  the eastern and western shores of South America are very distinct, with  extremely few shells, crustacea, or echinodermata in common; but Dr.
  Gunther has recently shown that about thirty per cent of the fishes are  the same on the opposite sides of the isthmus of Panama; and this fact  has led naturalists to believe that the isthmus was formerly open.
  Westward of the shores of America, a wide space of open ocean extends,  with not an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a  barrier of another kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the  eastern islands of the Pacific with another and totally distinct fauna.
  So that three marine faunas range northward and southward in parallel  lines not far from each other, under corresponding climate; but from  being separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of  land or open sea, they are almost wholly distinct.
 On the other hand,  proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the  tropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and  we have innumerable islands as halting-places, or continuous coasts,  until, after travelling over a hemisphere, we come to the shores of  Africa; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and  distinct marine faunas.
 Although so few marine animals are common to the  above-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western America and  the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fishes range from the Pacific into  the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern islands of  the Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa on almost exactly opposite  meridians of longitude.
    A third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statement, is the  affinity of the productions of the same continent or of the same sea,  though the species themselves are distinct at different points and  stations.
 It is a law of the widest generality, and every continent  offers innumerable instances.
 Nevertheless, the naturalist, in  travelling, for instance, from north to south, never fails to be  struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings, specifically  distinct, though nearly related, replace each other.
 He hears from  closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and  sees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs  coloured in nearly the same manner.
 The plains near the Straits of  Magellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea (American ostrich), and  northward the plains of La Plata by another species of the same genus;  and not by a true ostrich or emu, like those inhabiting Africa and  Australia under the same latitude.
 On these same plains of La Plata we  see the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as  our hares and rabbits, and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but  they plainly display an American type of structure.
 We ascend the lofty  peaks of the Cordillera, and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we  look to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or muskrat, but the  coypu and capybara, rodents of the South American type.
 Innumerable  other instances could be given.
 If we look to the islands off the  American shore, however much they may differ in geological structure,  the inhabitants are essentially American, though they may be all  peculiar species.
 We may look back to past ages, as shown in the last  chapter, and we find American types then prevailing on the American  continent and in the American seas.
 We see in these facts some deep  organic bond, throughout space and time, over the same areas of land and  water, independently of physical conditions.
 The naturalist must be dull  who is not led to inquire what this bond is.
    The bond is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as far as we  positively know, produces organisms quite like each other, or, as we  see in the case of varieties, nearly alike.
 The dissimilarity of the  inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification  through variation and natural selection, and probably in a subordinate  degree to the definite influence of different physical conditions.
  The degrees of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more  dominant forms of life from one region into another having been more  or less effectually prevented, at periods more or less remote--on the  nature and number of the former immigrants--and on the action of the  inhabitants on each other in leading to the preservation of different  modifications; the relation of organism to organism in the struggle for  life being, as I have already often remarked, the most important of  all relations.
 Thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by  checking migration; as does time for the slow process of modification  through natural selection.
 Widely-ranging species, abounding in  individuals, which have already triumphed over many competitors in their  own widely-extended homes, will have the best chance of seizing on new  places, when they spread out into new countries.
 In their new homes they  will be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently undergo further  modification and improvement; and thus they will become still further  victorious, and will produce groups of modified descendants.
 On this  principle of inheritance with modification we can understand how it is  that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families, are confined  to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.
    There is no evidence, as was remarked in the last chapter, of the  existence of any law of necessary development.
 As the variability of  each species is an independent property, and will be taken advantage of  by natural selection, only so far as it profits each individual in its  complex struggle for life, so the amount of modification in different  species will be no uniform quantity.
 If a number of species, after  having long competed with each other in their old home, were to migrate  in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country, they would be  little liable to modification; for neither migration nor isolation in  themselves effect anything.
 These principles come into play only by  bringing organisms into new relations with each other and in a lesser  degree with the surrounding physical conditions.
 As we have seen in the  last chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character  from an enormously remote geological period, so certain species have  migrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly or at all  modified.
    According to these views, it is obvious that the several species of the  same genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world,  must originally have proceeded from the same source, as they are  descended from the same progenitor.
 In the case of those species which  have undergone, during whole geological periods, little modification,  there is not much difficulty in believing that they have migrated from  the same region; for during the vast geographical and climatical  changes which have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of  migration is possible.
 But in many other cases, in which we have  reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within  comparatively recent times, there is great difficulty on this head.
 It  is also obvious that the individuals of the same species, though now  inhabiting distant and isolated regions, must have proceeded from  one spot, where their parents were first produced: for, as has been  explained, it is incredible that individuals identically the same should  have been produced from parents specifically distinct.
    SINGLE CENTRES OF SUPPOSED CREATION.
    We are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by  naturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more  points of the earth's surface.
 Undoubtedly there are many cases of  extreme difficulty in understanding how the same species could possibly  have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated  points, where now found.
 Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that  each species was first produced within a single region captivates the  mind.
 He who rejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation  with subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle.
 It is  universally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species  is continuous; and that when a plant or animal inhabits two points so  distant from each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the  space could not have been easily passed over by migration, the fact  is given as something remarkable and exceptional.
 The incapacity of  migrating across a wide sea is more clear in the case of terrestrial  mammals than perhaps with any other organic beings; and, accordingly,  we find no inexplicable instances of the same mammals inhabiting distant  points of the world.
 No geologist feels any difficulty in Great Britain  possessing the same quadrupeds with the rest of Europe, for they were  no doubt once united.
 But if the same species can be produced at two  separate points, why do we not find a single mammal common to Europe and  Australia or South America? The conditions of life are nearly the  same, so that a multitude of European animals and plants have become  naturalised in America and Australia; and some of the aboriginal plants  are identically the same at these distant points of the northern and  southern hemispheres? The answer, as I believe, is, that mammals have  not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from their varied means  of dispersal, have migrated across the wide and broken interspaces.
 The  great and striking influence of barriers of all kinds, is intelligible  only on the view that the great majority of species have been produced  on one side, and have not been able to migrate to the opposite side.
  Some few families, many subfamilies, very many genera, a still greater  number of sections of genera, are confined to a single region; and it  has been observed by several naturalists that the most natural genera,  or those genera in which the species are most closely related to each  other, are generally confined to the same country, or if they have a  wide range that their range is continuous.
 What a strange anomaly it  would be if a directly opposite rule were to prevail when we go down one  step lower in the series, namely to the individuals of the same species,  and these had not been, at least at first, confined to some one region!    Hence, it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the  view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having  subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration  and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most  probable.
 Undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain how  the same species could have passed from one point to the other.
 But the  geographical and climatical changes which have certainly occurred within  recent geological times, must have rendered discontinuous the formerly  continuous range of many species.
 So that we are reduced to consider  whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous, and of so  grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered probable  by general considerations, that each species has been produced within  one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could.
 It would be  hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same  species, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a  moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many instances.
  But, after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most  striking classes of facts, namely, the existence of the same species  on the summits of distant mountain ranges, and at distant points in the  Arctic and Antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter),  the wide distribution of fresh water productions; and thirdly, the  occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the nearest  mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea.
 If the  existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the  earth's surface can in many instances be explained on the view of each  species having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our  ignorance with respect to former climatical and geographical changes,  and to the various occasional means of transport, the belief that a  single birthplace is the law seems to me incomparably the safest.
    In discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to  consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several  species of a genus which must on our theory all be descended from a  common progenitor, can have migrated, undergoing modification during  their migration from some one area.
 If, when most of the species  inhabiting one region are different from those of another region, though  closely allied to them, it can be shown that migration from the one  region to the other has probably occurred at some former period, our  general view will be much strengthened; for the explanation is obvious  on the principle of descent with modification.
 A volcanic island, for  instance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles  from a continent, would probably receive from it in the course of time  a few colonists, and their descendants, though modified, would still be  related by inheritance to the inhabitants of that continent.
 Cases of  this nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter see, inexplicable  on the theory of independent creation.
 This view of the relation of the  species of one region to those of another, does not differ much from  that advanced by Mr. Wallace, who concludes that "every species has come  into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing  closely allied species.
" And it is now well known that he attributes  this coincidence to descent with modification.
    The question of single or multiple centres of creation differs from  another though allied question, namely, whether all the individuals  of the same species are descended from a single pair, or single  hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many  individuals simultaneously created.
 With organic beings which never  intercross, if such exist, each species, must be descended from a  succession of modified varieties, that have supplanted each other,  but have never blended with other individuals or varieties of the same  species, so that, at each successive stage of modification, all the  individuals of the same form will be descended from a single parent.
  But in the great majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which  habitually unite for each birth, or which occasionally intercross, the  individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area will be kept  nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will go on  simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification at each  stage will not be due to descent from a single parent.
 To illustrate  what I mean: our English race-horses differ from the horses of every  other breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to  descent from any single pair, but to continued care in the selecting and  training of many individuals during each generation.
    Before discussing the three classes of facts, which I have selected as  presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of "single  centres of creation," I must say a few words on the means of dispersal.
    MEANS OF DISPERSAL.
    Sir C.
 Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject.
 I can  give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts.
 Change  of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration.
 A region now  impassable to certain organisms from the nature of its climate, might  have been a high road for migration, when the climate was different.
 I  shall, however, presently have to discuss this branch of the subject  in some detail.
 Changes of level in the land must also have been highly  influential: a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas; submerge  it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and the two faunas will now  blend together, or may formerly have blended.
 Where the sea now extends,  land may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even  continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to  pass from one to the other.
 No geologist disputes that great mutations  of level have occurred within the period of existing organisms.
 Edward  Forbes insisted that all the islands in the Atlantic must have been  recently connected with Europe or Africa, and Europe likewise with  America.
 Other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every  ocean, and united almost every island with some mainland.
 If, indeed,  the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must be admitted that  scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to  some continent.
 This view cuts the Gordian knot of the dispersal of the  same species to the most distant points, and removes many a difficulty;  but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting such  enormous geographical changes within the period of existing species.
 It  seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations in the  level of the land or sea; but not of such vast changes in the position  and extension of our continents, as to have united them within the  recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic  islands.
 I freely admit the former existence of many islands, now buried  beneath the sea, which may have served as halting places for plants and  for many animals during their migration.
 In the coral-producing oceans  such sunken islands are now marked by rings of coral or atolls standing  over them.
 Whenever it is fully admitted, as it will some day be, that  each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in  the course of time we know something definite about the means of  distribution, we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the  former extension of the land.
 But I do not believe that it will ever be  proved that within the recent period most of our continents which now  stand quite separate, have been continuously, or almost continuously  united with each other, and with the many existing oceanic islands.
  Several facts in distribution--such as the great difference in the  marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continent--the close  relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to  their present inhabitants--the degree of affinity between the mammals  inhabiting islands with those of the nearest continent, being in part  determined (as we shall hereafter see) by the depth of the intervening  ocean--these and other such facts are opposed to the admission of such  prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period, as are  necessary on the view advanced by Forbes and admitted by his followers.
  The nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic  islands are likewise opposed to the belief of their former continuity of  continents.
 Nor does the almost universally volcanic composition of  such islands favour the admission that they are the wrecks of sunken  continents; if they had originally existed as continental mountain  ranges, some at least of the islands would have been formed, like other  mountain summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous and  other rocks, instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.
    I must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but  which more properly should be called occasional means of distribution.
  I shall here confine myself to plants.
 In botanical works, this or that  plant is often stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but the  greater or less facilities for transport across the sea may be said to  be almost wholly unknown.
 Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley's aid, a  few experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist  the injurious action of sea-water.
 To my surprise I found that out  of eighty-seven kinds, sixty-four germinated after an immersion of  twenty-eight days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days.
 It  deserves notice that certain orders were far more injured than others:  nine Leguminosae were tried, and, with one exception, they resisted the  salt-water badly; seven species of the allied orders, Hydrophyllaceae  and Polemoniaceae, were all killed by a month's immersion.
 For  convenience sake I chiefly tried small seeds without the capsules or  fruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not have been  floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured  by salt water.
 Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, etc.
,  and some of these floated for a long time.
 It is well known what a  difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and it  occurred to me that floods would often wash into the sea dried plants or  branches with seed-capsules or fruit attached to them.
 Hence I was led  to dry the stems and branches of ninety-four plants with ripe fruit, and  to place them on sea-water.
 The majority sank quickly, but some which,  whilst green, floated for a very short time, when dried floated much  longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried  they floated for ninety days, and afterwards when planted germinated;  an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for twenty-three days,  when dried it floated for eighty-five days, and the seeds afterwards  germinated: the ripe seeds of Helosciadium sank in two days, when  dried they floated for above ninety days, and afterwards germinated.
  Altogether, out of the ninety-four dried plants, eighteen floated for  above twenty-eight days; and some of the eighteen floated for a very  much longer period.
 So that as 64/87 kinds of seeds germinated after an  immersion of twenty-eight days; and as 18/94 distinct species with ripe  fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment)  floated, after being dried, for above twenty-eight days, we may  conclude, as far as anything can be inferred from these scanty facts,  that the seeds of 14/100 kinds of plants of any country might be floated  by sea-currents during twenty-eight days, and would retain their power  of germination.
 In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the  several Atlantic currents is thirty-three miles per diem (some currents  running at the rate of sixty miles per diem); on this average, the seeds  of 14/100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924  miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown by an  inland gale to a favourable spot, would germinate.
    Subsequently to my experiments, M.
 Martens tried similar ones, but in a  much better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea,  so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really  floating plants.
 He tried ninety-eight seeds, mostly different from  mine, but he chose many large fruits, and likewise seeds, from plants  which live near the sea; and this would have favoured both the average  length of their flotation and their resistance to the injurious action  of the salt-water.
 On the other hand, he did not previously dry the  plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have  caused some of them to have floated much longer.
 The result was that  18/98 of his seeds of different kinds floated for forty-two days, and  were then capable of germination.
 But I do not doubt that plants exposed  to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from  violent movement as in our experiments.
 Therefore, it would perhaps be  safer to assume that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after  having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in  width, and would then germinate.
 The fact of the larger fruits often  floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large  seeds or fruit which, as Alph.
 de Candolle has shown, generally have  restricted ranges, could hardly be transported by any other means.
    Seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner.
 Drift timber  is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the widest  oceans; and the natives of the coral islands in the Pacific procure  stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these  stones being a valuable royal tax.
 I find that when irregularly shaped  stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels of earth  are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind them, so  perfectly that not a particle could be washed away during the longest  transport: out of one small portion of earth thus COMPLETELY enclosed by  the roots of an oak about fifty years old, three dicotyledonous plants  germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation.
 Again,  I can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea,  sometimes escape being immediately devoured; and many kinds of seeds  in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and  vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in  sea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had floated  on artificial sea-water for thirty days, to my surprise nearly all  germinated.
    Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the  transportation of seeds.
 I could give many facts showing how frequently  birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the  ocean.
 We may safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of  flight would often be thirty-five miles an hour; and some authors have  given a far higher estimate.
 I have never seen an instance of nutritious  seeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit  pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey.
 In the  course of two months, I picked up in my garden twelve kinds of seeds,  out of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and some  of them, which were tried, germinated.
 But the following fact is more  important: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not,  as I know by trial, injure in the least the germination of seeds;  now, after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food, it is  positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for  twelve or even eighteen hours.
 A bird in this interval might easily be  blown to the distance of five hundred miles, and hawks are known to look  out for tired birds, and the contents of their torn crops might thus  readily get scattered.
 Some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole, and  after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours, disgorge pellets,  which, as I know from experiments made in the Zoological Gardens,  include seeds capable of germination.
 Some seeds of the oat, wheat,  millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after having been from  twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey;  and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days  and fourteen hours.
 Fresh-water fish, I find, eat seeds of many land and  water plants; fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds  might be transported from place to place.
 I forced many kinds of  seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to  fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds, after an interval of  many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their  excrement; and several of these seeds retained the power of germination.
  Certain seeds, however, were always killed by this process.
    Locusts are sometimes blown to great distances from the land.
 I myself  caught one 370 miles from the coast of Africa, and have heard of others  caught at greater distances.
 The Rev.
 R.
T.
 Lowe informed Sir C.
 Lyell  that in November, 1844, swarms of locusts visited the island of Madeira.
  They were in countless numbers, as thick as the flakes of snow in the  heaviest snowstorm, and extended upward as far as could be seen with a  telescope.
 During two or three days they slowly careered round and round  in an immense ellipse, at least five or six miles in diameter, and at  night alighted on the taller trees, which were completely coated with  them.
 They then disappeared over the sea, as suddenly as they had  appeared, and have not since visited the island.
 Now, in parts of Natal  it is believed by some farmers, though on insufficient evidence, that  injurious seeds are introduced into their grass-land in the dung left  by the great flights of locusts which often visit that country.
 In  consequence of this belief Mr. Weale sent me in a letter a small packet  of the dried pellets, out of which I extracted under the microscope  several seeds, and raised from them seven grass plants, belonging to  two species, of two genera.
 Hence a swarm of locusts, such as that which  visited Madeira, might readily be the means of introducing several kinds  of plants into an island lying far from the mainland.
    Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally clean, earth  sometimes adheres to them: in one case I removed sixty-one grains, and  in another case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from the  foot of a partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble as large as the  seed of a vetch.
 Here is a better case: the leg of a woodcock was sent  to me by a friend, with a little cake of dry earth attached to the  shank, weighing only nine grains; and this contained a seed of  the toad-rush (Juncus bufonius) which germinated and flowered.
 Mr.  Swaysland, of Brighton, who during the last forty years has paid close  attention to our migratory birds, informs me that he has often shot  wagtails (Motacillae), wheatears, and whinchats (Saxicolae), on their  first arrival on our shores, before they had alighted; and he has  several times noticed little cakes of earth attached to their feet.
 Many  facts could be given showing how generally soil is charged with seeds.
  For instance, Professor Newton sent me the leg of a red-legged partridge  (Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and could not fly, with a ball of  hard earth adhering to it, and weighing six and a half ounces.
 The earth  had been kept for three years, but when broken, watered and placed  under a bell glass, no less than eighty-two plants sprung from it: these  consisted of twelve monocotyledons, including the common oat, and at  least one kind of grass, and of seventy dicotyledons, which consisted,  judging from the young leaves, of at least three distinct species.
  With such facts before us, can we doubt that the many birds which are  annually blown by gales across great spaces of ocean, and which  annually migrate--for instance, the millions of quails across the  Mediterranean--must occasionally transport a few seeds embedded in  dirt adhering to their feet or beaks? But I shall have to recur to this  subject.
    As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and  have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, it can  hardly be doubted that they must occasionally, as suggested by Lyell,  have transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and  antarctic regions; and during the Glacial period from one part of the  now temperate regions to another.
 In the Azores, from the large number  of plants common to Europe, in comparison with the species on the other  islands of the Atlantic, which stand nearer to the mainland, and (as  remarked by Mr. H.
C.
 Watson) from their somewhat northern character, in  comparison with the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been  partly stocked by ice-borne seeds during the Glacial epoch.
 At my  request Sir C.
 Lyell wrote to M.
 Hartung to inquire whether he had  observed erratic boulders on these islands, and he answered that he had  found large fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in  the archipelago.
 Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed  their rocky burdens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it  is at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of  northern plants.
    Considering that these several means of transport, and that other means,  which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action year  after year for tens of thousands of years, it would, I think, be a  marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported.
  These means of transport are sometimes called accidental, but this is  not strictly correct: the currents of the sea are not accidental, nor  is the direction of prevalent gales of wind.
 It should be observed  that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great  distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a  great length of time to the action of sea water; nor could they be long  carried in the crops or intestines of birds.
 These means, however, would  suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred  miles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a  neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to another.
 The  floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled;  but would remain as distinct as they now are.
 The currents, from their  course, would never bring seeds from North America to Britain, though  they might and do bring seeds from the West Indies to our western  shores, where, if not killed by their very long immersion in salt  water, they could not endure our climate.
 Almost every year, one or two  land-birds are blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North  America to the western shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be  transported by these rare wanderers only by one means, namely, by dirt  adhering to their feet or beaks, which is in itself a rare accident.
  Even in this case, how small would be the chance of a seed falling on  favourable soil, and coming to maturity! But it would be a great error  to argue that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has  not, as far as is known (and it would be very difficult to prove this),  received within the last few centuries, through occasional means  of transport, immigrants from Europe or any other continent, that a  poorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from the mainland,  would not receive colonists by similar means.
 Out of a hundred kinds of  seeds or animals transported to an island, even if far less well-stocked  than Britain, perhaps not more than one would be so well fitted to  its new home, as to become naturalised.
 But this is no valid argument  against what would be effected by occasional means of transport, during  the long lapse of geological time, whilst the island was being upheaved,  and before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants.
 On almost bare  land, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly  every seed which chanced to arrive, if fitted for the climate, would  germinate and survive.
    DISPERSAL DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD.
    The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated  from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where Alpine species  could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases known of the  same species living at distant points, without the apparent possibility  of their having migrated from one point to the other.
 It is indeed a  remarkable fact to see so many plants of the same species living on the  snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts  of Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the plants on the White  Mountains, in the United States of America, are all the same with those  of Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with  those on the loftiest mountains of Europe.
 Even as long ago as 1747,  such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have  been independently created at many distinct points; and we might have  remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid  attention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see,  affords a simple explanation of these facts.
 We have evidence of almost  every conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that, within a very  recent geological period, central Europe and North America suffered  under an Arctic climate.
 The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell  their tale more plainly than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales,  with their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of  the icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled.
 So greatly  has the climate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic  moraines, left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize.
  Throughout a large part of the United States, erratic boulders and  scored rocks plainly reveal a former cold period.
    The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the  inhabitants of Europe, as explained by Edward Forbes, is substantially  as follows.
 But we shall follow the changes more readily, by supposing  a new glacial period slowly to come on, and then pass away, as formerly  occurred.
 As the cold came on, and as each more southern zone became  fitted for the inhabitants of the north, these would take the places of  the former inhabitants of the temperate regions.
 The latter, at the  same time would travel further and further southward, unless they were  stopped by barriers, in which case they would perish.
 The mountains  would become covered with snow and ice, and their former Alpine  inhabitants would descend to the plains.
 By the time that the cold had  reached its maximum, we should have an arctic fauna and flora, covering  the central parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees,  and even stretching into Spain.
 The now temperate regions of the United  States would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and  these would be nearly the same with those of Europe; for the present  circumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere travelled  southward, are remarkably uniform round the world.
    As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward,  closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more  temperate regions.
 And as the snow melted from the bases of the  mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed  ground, always ascending, as the warmth increased and the snow still  further disappeared, higher and higher, whilst their brethren were  pursuing their northern journey.
 Hence, when the warmth had fully  returned, the same species, which had lately lived together on the  European and North American lowlands, would again be found in the arctic  regions of the Old and New Worlds, and on many isolated mountain-summits  far distant from each other.
    Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so  immensely remote as the mountains of the United States and those of  Europe.
 We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants  of each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms  living due north or nearly due north of them: for the first migration  when the cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth,  would generally have been due south and north.
 The Alpine plants, for  example, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr. H.
C.
 Watson, and those of  the Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are more especially allied to the  plants of northern Scandinavia; those of the United States to Labrador;  those of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of that country.
  These views, grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained  occurrence of a former Glacial period, seem to me to explain in so  satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic  productions of Europe and America, that when in other regions we find  the same species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude,  without other evidence, that a colder climate formerly permitted their  migration across the intervening lowlands, now become too warm for their  existence.
    As the arctic forms moved first southward and afterwards backward to  the north, in unison with the changing climate, they will not have  been exposed during their long migrations to any great diversity of  temperature; and as they all migrated in a body together, their mutual  relations will not have been much disturbed.
 Hence, in accordance with  the principles inculcated in this volume, these forms will not have  been liable to much modification.
 But with the Alpine productions, left  isolated from the moment of the returning warmth, first at the bases  and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have  been somewhat different; for it is not likely that all the same arctic  species will have been left on mountain ranges far distant from each  other, and have survived there ever since; they will also, in all  probability, have become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which must  have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the Glacial  epoch, and which during the coldest period will have been temporarily  driven down to the plains; they will, also, have been subsequently  exposed to somewhat different climatical influences.
 Their mutual  relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently  they will have been liable to modification; and they have been modified;  for if we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the several  great European mountain ranges, one with another, though many of the  species remain identically the same, some exist as varieties, some as  doubtful forms or sub-species and some as distinct yet closely allied  species representing each other on the several ranges.
    In the foregoing illustration, I have assumed that at the commencement  of our imaginary Glacial period, the arctic productions were as uniform  round the polar regions as they are at the present day.
 But it is also  necessary to assume that many sub-arctic and some few temperate forms  were the same round the world, for some of the species which now exist  on the lower mountain slopes and on the plains of North America and  Europe are the same; and it may be asked how I account for this degree  of uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate forms round the world,  at the commencement of the real Glacial period.
 At the present day, the  sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds  are separated from each other by the whole Atlantic Ocean and by the  northern part of the Pacific.
 During the Glacial period, when the  inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than they  do at present, they must have been still more completely separated from  each other by wider spaces of ocean; so that it may well be asked  how the same species could then or previously have entered the two  continents.
 The explanation, I believe, lies in the nature of the  climate before the commencement of the Glacial period.
 At this, the  newer Pliocene period, the majority of the inhabitants of the world were  specifically the same as now, and we have good reason to believe that  the climate was warmer than at the present day.
 Hence, we may suppose  that the organisms which now live under latitude 60 degrees, lived  during the Pliocene period further north, under the Polar Circle, in  latitude 66-67 degrees; and that the present arctic productions then  lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole.
 Now, if we look at  a terrestrial globe, we see under the Polar Circle that there is almost  continuous land from western Europe through Siberia, to eastern America.
  And this continuity of the circumpolar land, with the consequent freedom  under a more favourable climate for intermigration, will account for the  supposed uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate productions of the  Old and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch.
    Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have long  remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to great  oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to extend the above view,  and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period, such as  the older Pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and animals  inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that these plants  and animals, both in the Old and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate  southwards as the climate became less warm, long before the commencement  of the Glacial period.
 We now see, as I believe, their descendants,  mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of Europe and the  United States.
 On this view we can understand the relationship with very  little identity, between the productions of North America and Europe--a  relationship which is highly remarkable, considering the distance of  the two areas, and their separation by the whole Atlantic Ocean.
 We can  further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers  that the productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary  stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the  present time; for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the  Old and New Worlds will have been almost continuously united by  land, serving as a bridge, since rendered impassable by cold, for the  intermigration of their inhabitants.
    During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as  the species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated  south of the Polar Circle, they will have been completely cut off from  each other.
 This separation, as far as the more temperate productions  are concerned, must have taken place long ages ago.
 As the plants and  animals migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one  great region with the native American productions, and would have had to  compete with them; and in the other great region, with those of the  Old World.
 Consequently we have here everything favourable for  much modification--for far more modification than with the Alpine  productions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the  several mountain ranges and on the arctic lands of Europe and North  America.
 Hence, it has come, that when we compare the now living  productions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find  very few identical species (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more  plants are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every  great class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical  races, and others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or  representative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically  distinct.
    As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration  of a marine fauna, which, during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier  period, was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar  Circle, will account, on the theory of modification, for many closely  allied forms now living in marine areas completely sundered.
 Thus, I  think, we can understand the presence of some closely allied, still  existing and extinct tertiary forms, on the eastern and western shores  of temperate North America; and the still more striking fact of many  closely allied crustaceans (as described in Dana's admirable work), some  fish and other marine animals, inhabiting the Mediterranean and the seas  of Japan--these two areas being now completely separated by the breadth  of a whole continent and by wide spaces of ocean.
    These cases of close relationship in species either now or formerly  inhabiting the seas on the eastern and western shores of North America,  the Mediterranean and Japan, and the temperate lands of North America  and Europe, are inexplicable on the theory of creation.
 We cannot  maintain that such species have been created alike, in correspondence  with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas; for if we  compare, for instance, certain parts of South America with parts of  South Africa or Australia, we see countries closely similar in all their  physical conditions, with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar.
    ALTERNATE GLACIAL PERIODS IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH.
    But we must return to our more immediate subject.
 I am convinced that  Forbes's view may be largely extended.
 In Europe we meet with the  plainest evidence of the Glacial period, from the western shores of  Britain to the Ural range, and southward to the Pyrenees.
 We may infer  from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation, that  Siberia was similarly affected.
 In the Lebanon, according to Dr.
 Hooker,  perpetual snow formerly covered the central axis, and fed glaciers which  rolled 4,000 feet down the valleys.
 The same observer has recently found  great moraines at a low level on the Atlas range in North Africa.
 Along  the Himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of  their former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr.
 Hooker saw maize growing  on ancient and gigantic moraines.
 Southward of the Asiatic continent, on  the opposite side of the equator, we know, from the excellent researches  of Dr.
 J.
 Haast and Dr.
 Hector, that in New Zealand immense glaciers  formerly descended to a low level; and the same plants, found by Dr.
  Hooker on widely separated mountains in this island tell the same story  of a former cold period.
 From facts communicated to me by the Rev.
 W.
B.
  Clarke, it appears also that there are traces of former glacial action  on the mountains of the south-eastern corner of Australia.
    Looking to America: in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of rock  have been observed on the eastern side of the continent, as far south as  latitude 36 and 37 degrees, and on the shores of the Pacific, where  the climate is now so different, as far south as latitude 46 degrees.
  Erratic boulders have, also, been noticed on the Rocky Mountains.
 In  the Cordillera of South America, nearly under the equator, glaciers once  extended far below their present level.
 In central Chile I examined  a vast mound of detritus with great boulders, crossing the Portillo  valley, which, there can hardly be a doubt, once formed a huge moraine;  and Mr. D.
 Forbes informs me that he found in various parts of the  Cordillera, from latitude 13 to 30 degrees south, at about the height of  12,000 feet, deeply-furrowed rocks, resembling those with which he was  familiar in Norway, and likewise great masses of detritus, including  grooved pebbles.
 Along this whole space of the Cordillera true glaciers  do not now exist even at much more considerable heights.
 Further  south, on both sides of the continent, from latitude 41 degrees to the  southernmost extremity, we have the clearest evidence of former glacial  action, in numerous immense boulders transported far from their parent  source.
    From these several facts, namely, from the glacial action having  extended all round the northern and southern hemispheres--from  the period having been in a geological sense recent in both  hemispheres--from its having lasted in both during a great length of  time, as may be inferred from the amount of work effected--and lastly,  from glaciers having recently descended to a low level along the whole  line of the Cordillera, it at one time appeared to me that we could not  avoid the conclusion that the temperature of the whole world had been  simultaneously lowered during the Glacial period.
 But now, Mr. Croll,  in a series of admirable memoirs, has attempted to show that a glacial  condition of climate is the result of various physical causes, brought  into operation by an increase in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.
  All these causes tend towards the same end; but the most powerful  appears to be the indirect influence of the eccentricity of the orbit  upon oceanic currents.
 According to Mr. Croll, cold periods regularly  recur every ten or fifteen thousand years; and these at long intervals  are extremely severe, owing to certain contingencies, of which the most  important, as Sir C.
 Lyell has shown, is the relative position of the  land and water.
 Mr. Croll believes that the last great glacial period  occurred about 240,000 years ago, and endured, with slight alterations  of climate, for about 160,000 years.
 With respect to more ancient  glacial periods, several geologists are convinced, from direct evidence,  that such occurred during the miocene and eocene formations, not to  mention still more ancient formations.
 But the most important result for  us, arrived at by Mr. Croll, is that whenever the northern hemisphere  passes through a cold period the temperature of the southern hemisphere  is actually raised, with the winters rendered much milder, chiefly  through changes in the direction of the ocean currents.
 So conversely it  will be with the northern hemisphere, while the southern passes through  a glacial period.
 This conclusion throws so much light on geographical  distribution that I am strongly inclined to trust in it; but I will  first give the facts which demand an explanation.
    In South America, Dr.
 Hooker has shown that besides many closely allied  species, between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of Tierra del  Fuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty flora, are common to  North America and Europe, enormously remote as these areas in opposite  hemispheres are from each other.
 On the lofty mountains of equatorial  America a host of peculiar species belonging to European genera occur.
  On the Organ Mountains of Brazil some few temperate European, some  Antarctic and some Andean genera were found by Gardner which do not  exist in the low intervening hot countries.
 On the Silla of Caraccas  the illustrious Humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera  characteristic of the Cordillera.
    In Africa, several forms characteristic of Europe, and some few  representatives of the flora of the Cape of Good Hope, occur on the  mountains of Abyssinia.
 At the Cape of Good Hope a very few European  species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and on the  mountains several representative European forms are found which have  not been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa.
 Dr.
 Hooker has  also lately shown that several of the plants living on the upper parts  of the lofty island of Fernando Po, and on the neighbouring Cameroon  Mountains, in the Gulf of Guinea, are closely related to those on the  mountains of Abyssinia, and likewise to those of temperate Europe.
 It  now also appears, as I hear from Dr.
 Hooker, that some of these same  temperate plants have been discovered by the Rev.
 R.
T.
 Lowe on the  mountains of the Cape Verde Islands.
 This extension of the same  temperate forms, almost under the equator, across the whole continent of  Africa and to the mountains of the Cape Verde archipelago, is one of the  most astonishing facts ever recorded in the distribution of plants.
    On the Himalaya, and on the isolated mountain ranges of the peninsula of  India, on the heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic cones of Java, many  plants occur either identically the same or representing each other,  and at the same time representing plants of Europe not found in the  intervening hot lowlands.
 A list of the genera of plants collected on  the loftier peaks of Java, raises a picture of a collection made on  a hillock in Europe.
 Still more striking is the fact that peculiar  Australian forms are represented by certain plants growing on the  summits of the mountains of Borneo.
 Some of these Australian forms, as  I hear from Dr.
 Hooker, extend along the heights of the peninsula of  Malacca, and are thinly scattered on the one hand over India, and on the  other hand as far north as Japan.
    On the southern mountains of Australia, Dr.
 F.
 Muller has discovered  several European species; other species, not introduced by man, occur  on the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I am informed by  Dr.
 Hooker, of European genera, found in Australia, but not in the  intermediate torrid regions.
 In the admirable "Introduction to the Flora  of New Zealand," by Dr.
 Hooker, analogous and striking facts are given  in regard to the plants of that large island.
 Hence, we see that certain  plants growing on the more lofty mountains of the tropics in all parts  of the world, and on the temperate plains of the north and south, are  either the same species or varieties of the same species.
 It should,  however, be observed that these plants are not strictly arctic forms;  for, as Mr. H.
C.
 Watson has remarked, "in receding from polar toward  equatorial latitudes, the Alpine or mountain flora really become less  and less Arctic.
" Besides these identical and closely allied forms, many  species inhabiting the same widely sundered areas, belong to genera not  now found in the intermediate tropical lowlands.
    These brief remarks apply to plants alone; but some few analogous facts  could be given in regard to terrestrial animals.
 In marine productions,  similar cases likewise occur; as an example, I may quote a statement  by the highest authority, Prof.
 Dana, that "it is certainly a wonderful  fact that New Zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea  to Great Britain, its antipode, than to any other part of the world.
"  Sir J.
 Richardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the shores of New  Zealand, Tasmania, etc.
, of northern forms of fish.
 Dr.
 Hooker informs  me that twenty-five species of Algae are common to New Zealand and to  Europe, but have not been found in the intermediate tropical seas.
    From the foregoing facts, namely, the presence of temperate forms  on the highlands across the whole of equatorial Africa, and along the  Peninsula of India, to Ceylon and the Malay Archipelago, and in a less  well-marked manner across the wide expanse of tropical South America, it  appears almost certain that at some former period, no doubt during  the most severe part of a Glacial period, the lowlands of these great  continents were everywhere tenanted under the equator by a considerable  number of temperate forms.
 At this period the equatorial climate at the  level of the sea was probably about the same with that now experienced  at the height of from five to six thousand feet under the same latitude,  or perhaps even rather cooler.
 During this, the coldest period, the  lowlands under the equator must have been clothed with a mingled  tropical and temperate vegetation, like that described by Hooker as  growing luxuriantly at the height of from four to five thousand feet  on the lower slopes of the Himalaya, but with perhaps a still greater  preponderance of temperate forms.
 So again in the mountainous island of  Fernando Po, in the Gulf of Guinea, Mr. Mann found temperate European  forms beginning to appear at the height of about five thousand feet.
 On  the mountains of Panama, at the height of only two thousand feet, Dr.
  Seemann found the vegetation like that of Mexico, "with forms of the  torrid zone harmoniously blended with those of the temperate.
"    Now let us see whether Mr. Croll's conclusion that when the northern  hemisphere suffered from the extreme cold of the great Glacial period,  the southern hemisphere was actually warmer, throws any clear light on  the present apparently inexplicable distribution of various organisms  in the temperate parts of both hemispheres, and on the mountains of the  tropics.
 The Glacial period, as measured by years, must have been very  long; and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants  and animals have spread within a few centuries, this period will have  been ample for any amount of migration.
 As the cold became more and more  intense, we know that Arctic forms invaded the temperate regions; and  from the facts just given, there can hardly be a doubt that some of the  more vigorous, dominant and widest-spreading temperate forms invaded the  equatorial lowlands.
 The inhabitants of these hot lowlands would at the  same time have migrated to the tropical and subtropical regions of the  south, for the southern hemisphere was at this period warmer.
 On the  decline of the Glacial period, as both hemispheres gradually recovered  their former temperature, the northern temperate forms living on the  lowlands under the equator, would have been driven to their former homes  or have been destroyed, being replaced by the equatorial forms returning  from the south.
 Some, however, of the northern temperate forms would  almost certainly have ascended any adjoining high land, where, if  sufficiently lofty, they would have long survived like the Arctic  forms on the mountains of Europe.
 They might have survived, even if the  climate was not perfectly fitted for them, for the change of temperature  must have been very slow, and plants undoubtedly possess a certain  capacity for acclimatisation, as shown by their transmitting to their  offspring different constitutional powers of resisting heat and cold.
    In the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in  its turn be subjected to a severe Glacial period, with the northern  hemisphere rendered warmer; and then the southern temperate forms would  invade the equatorial lowlands.
 The northern forms which had before been  left on the mountains would now descend and mingle with the southern  forms.
 These latter, when the warmth returned, would return to their  former homes, leaving some few species on the mountains, and carrying  southward with them some of the northern temperate forms which had  descended from their mountain fastnesses.
 Thus, we should have some  few species identically the same in the northern and southern temperate  zones and on the mountains of the intermediate tropical regions.
 But  the species left during a long time on these mountains, or in opposite  hemispheres, would have to compete with many new forms and would be  exposed to somewhat different physical conditions; hence, they would  be eminently liable to modification, and would generally now exist as  varieties or as representative species; and this is the case.
 We must,  also, bear in mind the occurrence in both hemispheres of former Glacial  periods; for these will account, in accordance with the same principles,  for the many quite distinct species inhabiting the same widely separated  areas, and belonging to genera not now found in the intermediate torrid  zones.
    It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to  America, and by Alph.
 de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many more  identical or slightly modified species have migrated from the north to  the south, than in a reversed direction.
 We see, however, a few southern  forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia.
 I suspect that this  preponderant migration from the north to the south is due to the greater  extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed  in their own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been  advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of  perfection, or dominating power, than the southern forms.
 And thus, when  the two sets became commingled in the equatorial regions, during the  alternations of the Glacial periods, the northern forms were the more  powerful and were able to hold their places on the mountains, and  afterwards migrate southward with the southern forms; but not so the  southern in regard to the northern forms.
 In the same manner, at the  present day, we see that very many European productions cover the ground  in La Plata, New Zealand, and to a lesser degree in Australia, and have  beaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern forms have become  naturalised in any part of the northern hemisphere, though hides, wool,  and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into  Europe during the last two or three centuries from La Plata and during  the last forty or fifty years from Australia.
 The Neilgherrie Mountains  in India, however, offer a partial exception; for here, as I hear from  Dr.
 Hooker, Australian forms are rapidly sowing themselves and becoming  naturalised.
 Before the last great Glacial period, no doubt the  intertropical mountains were stocked with endemic Alpine forms;  but these have almost everywhere yielded to the more dominant forms  generated in the larger areas and more efficient workshops of the north.
  In many islands the native productions are nearly equalled, or even  outnumbered, by those which have become naturalised; and this is the  first stage towards their extinction.
 Mountains are islands on the land;  and their inhabitants have yielded to those produced within the larger  areas of the north, just in the same way as the inhabitants of real  islands have everywhere yielded and are still yielding to continental  forms naturalised through man's agency.
    The same principles apply to the distribution of terrestrial animals and  of marine productions, in the northern and southern temperate zones, and  on the intertropical mountains.
 When, during the height of the Glacial  period, the ocean-currents were widely different to what they now are,  some of the inhabitants of the temperate seas might have reached  the equator; of these a few would perhaps at once be able to migrate  southwards, by keeping to the cooler currents, while others might remain  and survive in the colder depths until the southern hemisphere was in  its turn subjected to a glacial climate and permitted their further  progress; in nearly the same manner as, according to Forbes, isolated  spaces inhabited by Arctic productions exist to the present day in the  deeper parts of the northern temperate seas.
    I am far from supposing that all the difficulties in regard to the  distribution and affinities of the identical and allied species, which  now live so widely separated in the north and south, and sometimes on  the intermediate mountain ranges, are removed on the views above given.
  The exact lines of migration cannot be indicated.
 We cannot say why  certain species and not others have migrated; why certain species  have been modified and have given rise to new forms, while others have  remained unaltered.
 We cannot hope to explain such facts, until we can  say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man's agency  in a foreign land; why one species ranges twice or thrice as far, and is  twice or thrice as common, as another species within their own homes.
    Various special difficulties also remain to be solved; for instance,  the occurrence, as shown by Dr.
 Hooker, of the same plants at points  so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia; but  icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, may have been concerned in their  dispersal.
 The existence at these and other distant points of the  southern hemisphere, of species, which, though distinct, belong to  genera exclusively confined to the south, is a more remarkable case.
  Some of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that there  has been time since the commencement of the last Glacial period for  their migration and subsequent modification to the necessary degree.
  The facts seem to indicate that distinct species belonging to the same  genera have migrated in radiating lines from a common centre; and I am  inclined to look in the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a  former and warmer period, before the commencement of the last Glacial  period, when the Antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a  highly peculiar and isolated flora.
 It may be suspected that before this  flora was exterminated during the last Glacial epoch, a few forms  had been already widely dispersed to various points of the southern  hemisphere by occasional means of transport, and by the aid, as  halting-places, of now sunken islands.
 Thus the southern shores of  America, Australia, and New Zealand may have become slightly tinted by  the same peculiar forms of life.
    Sir C.
 Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost  identical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate  throughout the world on geographical distribution.
 And we have now seen  that Mr. Croll's conclusion that successive Glacial periods in the one  hemisphere coincide with warmer periods in the opposite hemisphere,  together with the admission of the slow modification of species,  explains a multitude of facts in the distribution of the same and of the  allied forms of life in all parts of the globe.
 The living waters have  flowed during one period from the north and during another from the  south, and in both cases have reached the equator; but the stream of  life has flowed with greater force from the north than in the opposite  direction, and has consequently more freely inundated the south.
 As the  tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, rising higher on the shores  where the tide rises highest, so have the living waters left their  living drift on our mountain summits, in a line gently rising from  the Arctic lowlands to a great latitude under the equator.
 The various  beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man,  driven up and surviving in the mountain fastnesses of almost every  land, which serves as a record, full of interest to us, of the former  inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.

      FRESH-WATER PRODUCTIONS.
    As lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of  land, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not  have ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently  a still more formidable barrier, that they would never have extended to  distant countries.
 But the case is exactly the reverse.
 Not only have  many fresh-water species, belonging to different classes, an enormous  range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout  the world.
 When first collecting in the fresh waters of Brazil, I well  remember feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water  insects, shells, etc.
, and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding  terrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain.
    But the wide ranging power of fresh-water productions can, I think,  in most cases be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner  highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond  to pond, or from stream to stream, within their own countries; and  liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost  necessary consequence.
 We can here consider only a few cases; of these,  some of the most difficult to explain are presented by fish.
 It was  formerly believed that the same fresh-water species never existed on  two continents distant from each other.
 But Dr.
 Gunther has lately  shown that the Galaxias attenuatus inhabits Tasmania, New Zealand, the  Falkland Islands and the mainland of South America.
 This is a wonderful  case, and probably indicates dispersal from an Antarctic centre during a  former warm period.
 This case, however, is rendered in some degree less  surprising by the species of this genus having the power of crossing by  some unknown means considerable spaces of open ocean: thus there is  one species common to New Zealand and to the Auckland Islands, though  separated by a distance of about 230 miles.
 On the same continent  fresh-water fish often range widely, and as if capriciously; for in two  adjoining river systems some of the species may be the same and some  wholly different.
    It is probable that they are occasionally transported by what may be  called accidental means.
 Thus fishes still alive are not very rarely  dropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and it is known that the ova  retain their vitality for a considerable time after removal from the  water.
 Their dispersal may, however, be mainly attributed to changes in  the level of the land within the recent period, causing rivers to flow  into each other.
 Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred  during floods, without any change of level.
 The wide differences of the  fish on the opposite sides of most mountain-ranges, which are continuous  and consequently must, from an early period, have completely prevented  the inosculation of the river systems on the two sides, leads to the  same conclusion.
 Some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms,  and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical  changes, and consequently time and means for much migration.
 Moreover,  Dr.
 Gunther has recently been led by several considerations to infer  that with fishes the same forms have a long endurance.
 Salt-water  fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and,  according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of which  all the members are confined to fresh water, so that a marine species  belonging to a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores  of the sea, and could, it is probable, become adapted without much  difficulty to the fresh waters of a distant land.
    Some species of fresh-water shells have very wide ranges, and allied  species which, on our theory, are descended from a common parent, and  must have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world.
  Their distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not  likely to be transported by birds; and the ova, as well as the adults,  are immediately killed by sea-water.
 I could not even understand  how some naturalised species have spread rapidly throughout the same  country.
 But two facts, which I have observed--and many others no  doubt will be discovered--throw some light on this subject.
 When ducks  suddenly emerge from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen  these little plants adhering to their backs; and it has happened to me,  in removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I have  unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other.
  But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended the feet of a  duck in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching;  and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just-hatched shells  crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out  of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more  advanced age they would voluntarily drop off.
 These just-hatched  molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet,  in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time  a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and  if blown across the sea to an oceanic island, or to any other distant  point, would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet.
 Sir Charles Lyell  informs me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water  shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a water-beetle of  the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the "Beagle," when  forty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much farther it  might have been blown by a favouring gale no one can tell.
    With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many  fresh-water, and even marsh-species, have, both over continents and  to the most remote oceanic islands.
 This is strikingly illustrated,  according to Alph.
 de Candolle, in those large groups of terrestrial  plants, which have very few aquatic members; for the latter seem  immediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a wide range.
 I think  favourable means of dispersal explain this fact.
 I have before mentioned  that earth occasionally adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks  of birds.
 Wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if  suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet.
 Birds  of this order wander more than those of any other; and are occasionally  found on the most remote and barren islands of the open ocean; they  would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so that any  dirt on their feet would not be washed off; and when gaining the land,  they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water haunts.
 I do not  believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with  seeds: I have tried several little experiments, but will here give only  the most striking case: I took in February three tablespoonfuls of mud  from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little  pond; this mud when dry weighed only 6 and 3/4 ounces; I kept it covered  up in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it  grew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number;  and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! Considering  these facts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if  water-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to  unstocked ponds and streams, situated at very distant points.
 The same  agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller  fresh-water animals.
    Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part.
 I have  stated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject  many other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow  seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and Potamogeton.
  Herons and other birds, century after century, have gone on daily  devouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters, or are  blown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their power of  germination, when rejected many hours afterwards in pellets or in  the excrement.
 When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine  water-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph.
 de Candolle's remarks  on the distribution of this plant, I thought that the means of its  dispersal must remain inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found  the seeds of the great southern water-lily (probably according to Dr.
  Hooker, the Nelumbium luteum) in a heron's stomach.
 Now this bird must  often have flown with its stomach thus well stocked to distant ponds,  and, then getting a hearty meal of fish, analogy makes me believe  that it would have rejected the seeds in the pellet in a fit state for  germination.
    In considering these several means of distribution, it should be  remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance on a  rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will have  a good chance of succeeding.
 Although there will always be a struggle  for life between the inhabitants of the same pond, however few in kind,  yet as the number even in a well-stocked pond is small in comparison  with the number of species inhabiting an equal area of land, the  competition between them will probably be less severe than between  terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a  foreign country would have a better chance of seizing on a new place,  than in the case of terrestrial colonists.
 We should also remember that  many fresh-water productions are low in the scale of nature, and we have  reason to believe that such beings become modified more slowly than the  high; and this will give time for the migration of aquatic species.
  We should not forget the probability of many fresh-water forms having  formerly ranged continuously over immense areas, and then having become  extinct at intermediate points.
 But the wide distribution of fresh-water  plants, and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical  form, or in some degree modified, apparently depends in main part on the  wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by  fresh-water birds, which have great powers of flight, and naturally  travel from one piece of water to another.
    ON THE INHABITANTS OF OCEANIC ISLANDS.
    We now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I have  selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty with respect to  distribution, on the view that not only all the individuals of the  same species have migrated from some one area, but that allied species,  although now inhabiting the most distant points, have proceeded from a  single area, the birthplace of their early progenitors.
 I have already  given my reasons for disbelieving in continental extensions within the  period of existing species on so enormous a scale that all the many  islands of the several oceans were thus stocked with their present  terrestrial inhabitants.
 This view removes many difficulties, but it  does not accord with all the facts in regard to the productions of  islands.
 In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere  question of dispersal, but shall consider some other cases bearing on  the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent  with modification.
    The species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number  compared with those on equal continental areas: Alph.
 de Candolle admits  this for plants, and Wollaston for insects.
 New Zealand, for instance,  with its lofty mountains and diversified stations, extending over 780  miles of latitude, together with the outlying islands of Auckland,  Campbell and Chatham, contain altogether only 960 kinds of flowering  plants; if we compare this moderate number with the species which swarm  over equal areas in Southwestern Australia or at the Cape of Good Hope,  we must admit that some cause, independently of different physical  conditions, has given rise to so great a difference in number.
 Even the  uniform county of Cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of  Anglesea 764, but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included  in these numbers, and the comparison in some other respects is not quite  fair.
 We have evidence that the barren island of Ascension aboriginally  possessed less than half-a-dozen flowering plants; yet many species have  now become naturalised on it, as they have in New Zealand and on every  other oceanic island which can be named.
 In St.
 Helena there is reason  to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite  exterminated many native productions.
 He who admits the doctrine of the  creation of each separate species, will have to admit that a sufficient  number of the best adapted plants and animals were not created for  oceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them far more fully  and perfectly than did nature.
    Although in oceanic islands the species are few in number, the  proportion of endemic kinds (i.
e.
 those found nowhere else in the world)  is often extremely large.
 If we compare, for instance, the number of  endemic land-shells in Madeira, or of endemic birds in the Galapagos  Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then compare  the area of the island with that of the continent, we shall see that  this is true.
 This fact might have been theoretically expected, for, as  already explained, species occasionally arriving, after long intervals  of time in the new and isolated district, and having to compete with new  associates, would be eminently liable to modification, and would often  produce groups of modified descendants.
 But it by no means follows that,  because in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar,  those of another class, or of another section of the same class, are  peculiar; and this difference seems to depend partly on the species  which are not modified having immigrated in a body, so that their mutual  relations have not been much disturbed; and partly on the frequent  arrival of unmodified immigrants from the mother-country, with which  the insular forms have intercrossed.
 It should be borne in mind that the  offspring of such crosses would certainly gain in vigour; so that even  an occasional cross would produce more effect than might have been  anticipated.
 I will give a few illustrations of the foregoing remarks:  in the Galapagos Islands there are twenty-six land birds; of these  twenty-one (or perhaps twenty-three) are peculiar; whereas of the eleven  marine birds only two are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds  could arrive at these islands much more easily and frequently than  land-birds.
 Bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the same  distance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do from South  America, and which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess a single  endemic land bird; and we know from Mr. J.
M.
 Jones's admirable account  of Bermuda, that very many North American birds occasionally or even  frequently visit this island.
 Almost every year, as I am informed by  Mr. E.
V.
 Harcourt, many European and African birds are blown to Madeira;  this island is inhabited by ninety-nine kinds, of which one alone is  peculiar, though very closely related to a European form; and three or  four other species are confined to this island and to the Canaries.
  So that the islands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked from the  neighbouring continents with birds, which for long ages have there  struggled together, and have become mutually co-adapted.
 Hence, when  settled in their new homes, each kind will have been kept by the others  to its proper place and habits, and will consequently have been but  little liable to modification.
 Any tendency to modification will also  have been checked by intercrossing with the unmodified immigrants,  often arriving from the mother-country.
 Madeira again is inhabited by  a wonderful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not one species  of sea-shell is peculiar to its shores: now, though we do not know how  sea-shells are dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvae,  perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading  birds, might be transported across three or four hundred miles of open  sea far more easily than land-shells.
 The different orders of insects  inhabiting Madeira present nearly parallel cases.
    Oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in animals of certain whole  classes, and their places are occupied by other classes; thus in the  Galapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds,  take, or recently took, the place of mammals.
 Although New Zealand  is here spoken of as an oceanic island, it is in some degree doubtful  whether it should be so ranked; it is of large size, and is not  separated from Australia by a profoundly deep sea; from its geological  character and the direction of its mountain ranges, the Rev.
 W.
B.
 Clarke  has lately maintained that this island, as well as New Caledonia, should  be considered as appurtenances of Australia.
 Turning to plants, Dr.
  Hooker has shown that in the Galapagos Islands the proportional numbers  of the different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere.
  All such differences in number, and the absence of certain whole  groups of animals and plants, are generally accounted for by supposed  differences in the physical conditions of the islands; but this  explanation is not a little doubtful.
 Facility of immigration seems to  have been fully as important as the nature of the conditions.
    Many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the  inhabitants of oceanic islands.
 For instance, in certain islands not  tenanted by a single mammal, some of the endemic plants have beautifully  hooked seeds; yet few relations are more manifest than that hooks serve  for the transportal of seeds in the wool or fur of quadrupeds.
 But a  hooked seed might be carried to an island by other means; and the plant  then becoming modified would form an endemic species, still retaining  its hooks, which would form a useless appendage, like the shrivelled  wings under the soldered wing-covers of many insular beetles.
 Again,  islands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which  elsewhere include only herbaceous species; now trees, as Alph.
 de  Candolle has shown, generally have, whatever the cause may be, confined  ranges.
 Hence trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic  islands; and an herbaceous plant, which had no chance of successfully  competing with the many fully developed trees growing on a continent,  might, when established on an island, gain an advantage over other  herbaceous plants by growing taller and taller and overtopping them.
  In this case, natural selection would tend to add to the stature of the  plant, to whatever order it belonged, and thus first convert it into a  bush and then into a tree.
    ABSENCE OF BATRACHIANS AND TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS ON OCEANIC ISLANDS.
    With respect to the absence of whole orders of animals on oceanic  islands, Bory St.
 Vincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs,  toads, newts) are never found on any of the many islands with which the  great oceans are studded.
 I have taken pains to verify this assertion,  and have found it true, with the exception of New Zealand, New  Caledonia, the Andaman Islands, and perhaps the Solomon Islands and the  Seychelles.
 But I have already remarked that it is doubtful whether New  Zealand and New Caledonia ought to be classed as oceanic islands; and  this is still more doubtful with respect to the Andaman and Solomon  groups and the Seychelles.
 This general absence of frogs, toads and  newts on so many true oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their  physical conditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly fitted  for these animals; for frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the  Azores, and Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance.
  But as these animals and their spawn are immediately killed (with the  exception, as far as known, of one Indian species) by sea-water, there  would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and  therefore we can see why they do not exist on strictly oceanic islands.
  But why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been created  there, it would be very difficult to explain.
    Mammals offer another and similar case.
 I have carefully searched the  oldest voyages, and have not found a single instance, free from doubt,  of a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals kept by the  natives) inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a continent  or great continental island; and many islands situated at a much less  distance are equally barren.
 The Falkland Islands, which are inhabited  by a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an exception; but this group cannot  be considered as oceanic, as it lies on a bank in connection with the  mainland at a distance of about 280 miles; moreover, icebergs formerly  brought boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly  transported foxes, as now frequently happens in the arctic regions.
 Yet  it cannot be said that small islands will not support at least small  mammals, for they occur in many parts of the world on very small  islands, when lying close to a continent; and hardly an island can be  named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and  greatly multiplied.
 It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation,  that there has not been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic  islands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation  which they have suffered, and by their tertiary strata: there has also  been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other  classes; and on continents it is known that new species of mammals  appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals.
  Although terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, aerial  mammals do occur on almost every island.
 New Zealand possesses two bats  found nowhere else in the world: Norfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago,  the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne Archipelagoes, and  Mauritius, all possess their peculiar bats.
 Why, it may be asked, has  the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on  remote islands? On my view this question can easily be answered; for no  terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea, but  bats can fly across.
 Bats have been seen wandering by day far over the  Atlantic Ocean; and two North American species, either regularly or  occasionally, visit Bermuda, at the distance of 600 miles from the  mainland.
 I hear from Mr. Tomes, who has specially studied this family,  that many species have enormous ranges, and are found on continents  and on far distant islands.
 Hence, we have only to suppose that such  wandering species have been modified in their new homes in relation to  their new position, and we can understand the presence of endemic bats  on oceanic islands, with the absence of all other terrestrial mammals.
    Another interesting relation exists, namely, between the depth of the  sea separating islands from each other, or from the nearest continent,  and the degree of affinity of their mammalian inhabitants.
 Mr. Windsor  Earl has made some striking observations on this head, since greatly  extended by Mr. Wallace's admirable researches, in regard to the great  Malay Archipelago, which is traversed near Celebes by a space of deep  ocean, and this separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas.
 On  either side, the islands stand on a moderately shallow submarine  bank, and these islands are inhabited by the same or by closely allied  quadrupeds.
 I have not as yet had time to follow up this subject in all  quarters of the world; but as far as I have gone, the relation holds  good.
 For instance, Britain is separated by a shallow channel from  Europe, and the mammals are the same on both sides; and so it is with  all the islands near the shores of Australia.
 The West Indian Islands,  on the other hand, stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly one thousand  fathoms in depth, and here we find American forms, but the species and  even the genera are quite distinct.
 As the amount of modification which  animals of all kinds undergo partly depends on the lapse of time, and as  the islands which are separated from each other, or from the mainland,  by shallow channels, are more likely to have been continuously united  within a recent period than the islands separated by deeper channels, we  can understand how it is that a relation exists between the depth of the  sea separating two mammalian faunas, and the degree of their affinity,  a relation which is quite inexplicable on the theory of independent acts  of creation.
    The foregoing statements in regard to the inhabitants of oceanic  islands, namely, the fewness of the species, with a large proportion  consisting of endemic forms--the members of certain groups, but not  those of other groups in the same class, having been modified--the  absence of certain whole orders, as of batrachians and of terrestrial  mammals, notwithstanding the presence of aerial bats, the singular  proportions of certain orders of plants, herbaceous forms having been  developed into trees, etc.
, seem to me to accord better with the belief  in the efficiency of occasional means of transport, carried on during  a long course of time, than with the belief in the former connection of  all oceanic islands with the nearest continent; for on this latter  view it is probable that the various classes would have immigrated more  uniformly, and from the species having entered in a body, their mutual  relations would not have been much disturbed, and consequently, they  would either have not been modified, or all the species in a more  equable manner.
    I do not deny that there are many and serious difficulties in  understanding how many of the inhabitants of the more remote islands,  whether still retaining the same specific form or subsequently modified,  have reached their present homes.
 But the probability of other islands  having once existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now remains,  must not be overlooked.
 I will specify one difficult case.
 Almost all  oceanic islands, even the most isolated and smallest, are inhabited  by land-shells, generally by endemic species, but sometimes by species  found elsewhere striking instances of which have been given by Dr.
 A.
A.
  Gould in relation to the Pacific.
 Now it is notorious that land-shells  are easily killed by sea-water; their eggs, at least such as I have  tried, sink in it and are killed.
 Yet there must be some unknown,  but occasionally efficient means for their transportal.
 Would the  just-hatched young sometimes adhere to the feet of birds roosting on  the ground and thus get transported? It occurred to me that land-shells,  when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the  shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately  wide arms of the sea.
 And I find that several species in this state  withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water during seven days.
 One  shell, the Helix pomatia, after having been thus treated, and again  hybernating, was put into sea-water for twenty days and perfectly  recovered.
 During this length of time the shell might have been  carried by a marine country of average swiftness to a distance of 660  geographical miles.
 As this Helix has a thick calcareous operculum  I removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, I again  immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and again it recovered and  crawled away.
 Baron Aucapitaine has since tried similar experiments.
 He  placed 100 land-shells, belonging to ten species, in a box pierced with  holes, and immersed it for a fortnight in the sea.
 Out of the hundred  shells twenty-seven recovered.
 The presence of an operculum seems  to have been of importance, as out of twelve specimens of Cyclostoma  elegans, which is thus furnished, eleven revived.
 It is remarkable,  seeing how well the Helix pomatia resisted with me the salt-water, that  not one of fifty-four specimens belonging to four other species of Helix  tried by Aucapitaine recovered.
 It is, however, not at all probable that  land-shells have often been thus transported; the feet of birds offer a  more probable method.
    ON THE RELATIONS OF THE INHABITANTS OF ISLANDS TO THOSE OF THE NEAREST  MAINLAND.
    The most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the  species which inhabit islands to those of the nearest mainland,  without being actually the same.
 Numerous instances could be given.
 The  Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, lies at a distance of  between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South America.
 Here almost  every product of the land and of the water bears the unmistakable stamp  of the American continent.
 There are twenty-six land birds.
 Of these  twenty-one, or perhaps twenty-three, are ranked as distinct species,  and would commonly be assumed to have been here created; yet the close  affinity of most of these birds to American species is manifest in every  character in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice.
 So it is with  the other animals, and with a large proportion of the plants, as  shown by Dr.
 Hooker in his admirable Flora of this archipelago.
 The  naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the  Pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent, feels that  he is standing on American land.
 Why should this be so? Why should  the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos  Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plainly the stamp of affinity to  those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in  the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in  the proportions in which the several classes are associated together,  which closely resembles the conditions of the South American coast.
 In  fact, there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects.
 On  the other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the  volcanic nature of the soil, in the climate, height, and size of the  islands, between the Galapagos and Cape Verde Archipelagos: but what an  entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of  the Cape Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of  the Galapagos to America.
 Facts, such as these, admit of no sort of  explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas, on  the view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would  be likely to receive colonists from America, whether by occasional means  of transport or (though I do not believe in this doctrine) by formerly  continuous land, and the Cape Verde Islands from Africa; such colonists  would be liable to modification--the principle of inheritance still  betraying their original birthplace.
    Many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal  rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the  nearest continent, or of the nearest large island.
 The exceptions are  few, and most of them can be explained.
 Thus, although Kerguelen Land  stands nearer to Africa than to America, the plants are related, and  that very closely, as we know from Dr.
 Hooker's account, to those of  America: but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked  by seeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs, drifted by the  prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears.
 New Zealand in its endemic  plants is much more closely related to Australia, the nearest mainland,  than to any other region: and this is what might have been expected; but  it is also plainly related to South America, which, although the next  nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an  anomaly.
 But this difficulty partially disappears on the view that New  Zealand, South America, and the other southern lands, have been stocked  in part from a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely, from  the antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, during  a warmer tertiary period, before the commencement of the last Glacial  period.
 The affinity, which, though feeble, I am assured by Dr.
 Hooker  is real, between the flora of the south-western corner of Australia  and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far more remarkable case; but this  affinity is confined to the plants, and will, no doubt, some day be  explained.
    The same law which has determined the relationship between the  inhabitants of islands and the nearest mainland, is sometimes displayed  on a small scale, but in a most interesting manner, within the limits  of the same archipelago.
 Thus each separate island of the Galapagos  Archipelago is tenanted, and the fact is a marvellous one, by many  distinct species; but these species are related to each other in a very  much closer manner than to the inhabitants of the American continent,  or of any other quarter of the world.
 This is what might have been  expected, for islands situated so near to each other would almost  necessarily receive immigrants from the same original source, and  from each other.
 But how is it that many of the immigrants have been  differently modified, though only in a small degree, in islands situated  within sight of each other, having the same geological nature, the same  height, climate, etc? This long appeared to me a great difficulty: but  it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering  the physical conditions of a country as the most important; whereas it  cannot be disputed that the nature of the other species with which  each has to compete, is at least as important, and generally a far  more important element of success.
 Now if we look to the species which  inhabit the Galapagos Archipelago, and are likewise found in other  parts of the world, we find that they differ considerably in the several  islands.
 This difference might indeed have been expected if the  islands have been stocked by occasional means of transport--a seed, for  instance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that of  another plant to another island, though all proceeding from the same  general source.
 Hence, when in former times an immigrant first settled  on one of the islands, or when it subsequently spread from one to  another, it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions in the  different islands, for it would have to compete with a different set of  organisms; a plant, for instance, would find the ground best-fitted for  it occupied by somewhat different species in the different islands, and  would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies.
 If, then,  it varied, natural selection would probably favour different varieties  in the different islands.
 Some species, however, might spread and yet  retain the same character throughout the group, just as we see some  species spreading widely throughout a continent and remaining the same.
    The really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago,  and in a lesser degree in some analogous cases, is that each new species  after being formed in any one island, did not spread quickly to the  other islands.
 But the islands, though in sight of each other, are  separated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British  Channel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former  period been continuously united.
 The currents of the sea are rapid and  deep between the islands, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so  that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than  they appear on a map.
 Nevertheless, some of the species, both of  those found in other parts of the world and of those confined to the  archipelago, are common to the several islands; and we may infer from  the present manner of distribution that they have spread from one island  to the others.
 But we often take, I think, an erroneous view of the  probability of closely allied species invading each other's territory,  when put into free intercommunication.
 Undoubtedly, if one species has  any advantage over another, it will in a very brief time wholly or in  part supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their own  places, both will probably hold their separate places for almost  any length of time.
 Being familiar with the fact that many species,  naturalised through man's agency, have spread with astonishing rapidity  over wide areas, we are apt to infer that most species would thus  spread; but we should remember that the species which become naturalised  in new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal  inhabitants, but are very distinct forms, belonging in a large  proportion of cases, as shown by Alph.
 de Candolle, to distinct genera.
  In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though so well  adapted for flying from island to island, differ on the different  islands; thus there are three closely allied species of mocking-thrush,  each confined to its own island.
 Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush  of Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island, which has its own  mocking-thrush; why should it succeed in establishing itself there?  We may safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own  species, for annually more eggs are laid and young birds hatched  than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush  peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for its home as is  the species peculiar to Chatham Island.
 Sir C.
 Lyell and Mr. Wollaston  have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject;  namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo possess many  distinct but representative species of land-shells, some of which  live in crevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are  annually transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island  has not become colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless, both  islands have been colonised by some European land-shells, which no  doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species.
 From these  considerations I think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic species  which inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago not  having all spread from island to island.
 On the same continent, also,  pre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the  commingling of the species which inhabit different districts with  nearly the same physical conditions.
 Thus, the south-east and south-west  corners of Australia have nearly the same physical conditions, and are  united by continuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast number of  distinct mammals, birds, and plants; so it is, according to Mr. Bates,  with the butterflies and other animals inhabiting the great, open, and  continuous valley of the Amazons.
    The same principle which governs the general character of the  inhabitants of oceanic islands, namely, the relation to the source  whence colonists could have been most easily derived, together with  their subsequent modification, is of the widest application throughout  nature.
 We see this on every mountain-summit, in every lake and marsh.
  For Alpine species, excepting in as far as the same species have become  widely spread during the Glacial epoch, are related to those of  the surrounding lowlands; thus we have in South America, Alpine  humming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, etc.
, all strictly  belonging to American forms; and it is obvious that a mountain, as  it became slowly upheaved, would be colonised from the surrounding  lowlands.
 So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting  in so far as great facility of transport has allowed the same forms  to prevail throughout large portions of the world.
 We see the same  principle in the character of most of the blind animals inhabiting the  caves of America and of Europe.
 Other analogous facts could be given.
  It will, I believe, be found universally true, that wherever in  two regions, let them be ever so distant, many closely allied or  representative species occur, there will likewise be found some  identical species; and wherever many closely-allied species occur,  there will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct  species, and others as mere varieties; these doubtful forms showing us  the steps in the process of modification.
    The relation between the power and extent of migration in certain  species, either at the present or at some former period, and the  existence at remote points of the world of closely allied species, is  shown in another and more general way.
 Mr. Gould remarked to me long  ago, that in those genera of birds which range over the world, many of  the species have very wide ranges.
 I can hardly doubt that this rule  is generally true, though difficult of proof.
 Among mammals, we see it  strikingly displayed in Bats, and in a lesser degree in the Felidae and  Canidae.
 We see the same rule in the distribution of butterflies and  beetles.
 So it is with most of the inhabitants of fresh water, for many  of the genera in the most distinct classes range over the world, and  many of the species have enormous ranges.
 It is not meant that all, but  that some of the species have very wide ranges in the genera which range  very widely.
 Nor is it meant that the species in such genera have, on an  average, a very wide range; for this will largely depend on how far the  process of modification has gone; for instance, two varieties of the  same species inhabit America and Europe, and thus the species has an  immense range; but, if variation were to be carried a little further,  the two varieties would be ranked as distinct species, and their range  would be greatly reduced.
 Still less is it meant, that species which  have the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely, as in the  case of certain powerfully-winged birds, will necessarily range widely;  for we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the  power of crossing barriers, but the more important power of being  victorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign  associates.
 But according to the view that all the species of a genus,  though distributed to the most remote points of the world, are descended  from a single progenitor, we ought to find, and I believe as a general  rule we do find, that some at least of the species range very widely.
    We should bear in mind that many genera in all classes are of ancient  origin, and the species in this case will have had ample time for  dispersal and subsequent modification.
 There is also reason to believe,  from geological evidence, that within each great class the lower  organisms change at a slower rate than the higher; consequently they  will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining  the same specific character.
 This fact, together with that of the seeds  and eggs of most lowly organised forms being very minute and better  fitted for distant transportal, probably accounts for a law which has  long been observed, and which has lately been discussed by Alph.
 de  Candolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of  organisms stands the more widely it ranges.
    The relations just discussed--namely, lower organisms ranging more  widely than the higher--some of the species of widely-ranging genera  themselves ranging widely--such facts, as alpine, lacustrine, and  marsh productions being generally related to those which live on the  surrounding low lands and dry lands--the striking relationship between  the inhabitants of islands and those of the nearest mainland--the still  closer relationship of the distinct inhabitants of the islands of  the same archipelago--are inexplicable on the ordinary view of the  independent creation of each species, but are explicable if we admit  colonisation from the nearest or readiest source, together with the  subsequent adaptation of the colonists to their new homes.
    SUMMARY OF THE LAST AND PRESENT CHAPTERS.
    In these chapters I have endeavoured to show that if we make due  allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of changes of climate  and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred within the  recent period, and of other changes which have probably occurred--if we  remember how ignorant we are with respect to the many curious means of  occasional transport--if we bear in mind, and this is a very important  consideration, how often a species may have ranged continuously over a  wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts--the  difficulty is not insuperable in believing that all the individuals of  the same species, wherever found, are descended from common parents.
  And we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many  naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by  various general considerations, more especially from the importance  of barriers of all kinds, and from the analogical distribution of  subgenera, genera, and families.
    With respect to distinct species belonging to the same genus, which  on our theory have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same  allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of  life have changed very slowly, enormous periods of time having been thus  granted for their migration, the difficulties are far from insuperable;  though in this case, as in that of the individuals of the same species,  they are often great.
    As exemplifying the effects of climatical changes on distribution, I  have attempted to show how important a part the last Glacial period has  played, which affected even the equatorial regions, and which, during  the alternations of the cold in the north and the south, allowed the  productions of opposite hemispheres to mingle, and left some of them  stranded on the mountain-summits in all parts of the world.
 As showing  how diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed  at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.
    If the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long  course of time all the individuals of the same species, and likewise  of the several species belonging to the same genus, have proceeded  from some one source; then all the grand leading facts of geographical  distribution are explicable on the theory of migration, together with  subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms.
 We can thus  understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, in  not only separating but in apparently forming the several zoological and  botanical provinces.
 We can thus understand the concentration of related  species within the same areas; and how it is that under different  latitudes, for instance, in South America, the inhabitants of the plains  and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are linked together  in so mysterious a manner, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings  which formerly inhabited the same continent.
 Bearing in mind that the  mutual relation of organism to organism is of the highest importance,  we can see why two areas, having nearly the same physical conditions,  should often be inhabited by very different forms of life; for according  to the length of time which has elapsed since the colonists entered one  of the regions, or both; according to the nature of the communication  which allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either in greater  or lesser numbers; according or not as those which entered happened to  come into more or less direct competition with each other and with the  aborigines; and according as the immigrants were capable of varying  more or less rapidly, there would ensue in the to or more regions,  independently of their physical conditions, infinitely diversified  conditions of life; there would be an almost endless amount of organic  action and reaction, and we should find some groups of beings greatly,  and some only slightly modified; some developed in great force, some  existing in scanty numbers--and this we do find in the several great  geographical provinces of the world.
    On these same principles we can understand, as I have endeavoured to  show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but that of  these, a large proportion should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in  relation to the means of migration, one group of beings should have all  its species peculiar, and another group, even within the same class,  should have all its species the same with those in an adjoining quarter  of the world.
 We can see why whole groups of organisms, as batrachians  and terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic islands, whilst  the most isolated islands should possess their own peculiar species of  aerial mammals or bats.
 We can see why, in islands, there should be some  relation between the presence of mammals, in a more or less modified  condition, and the depth of the sea between such islands and the  mainland.
 We can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago,  though specifically distinct on the several islets, should be closely  related to each other, and should likewise be related, but less closely,  to those of the nearest continent, or other source whence immigrants  might have been derived.
 We can see why, if there exist very closely  allied or representative species in two areas, however distant from each  other, some identical species will almost always there be found.
    As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking  parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space; the laws  governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same  with those governing at the present time the differences in different  areas.
 We see this in many facts.
 The endurance of each species and  group of species is continuous in time; for the apparent exceptions to  the rule are so few that they may fairly be attributed to our not having  as yet discovered in an intermediate deposit certain forms which are  absent in it, but which occur above and below: so in space, it certainly  is the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species, or by a  group of species, is continuous, and the exceptions, which are not rare,  may, as I have attempted to show, be accounted for by former migrations  under different circumstances, or through occasional means of transport,  or by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts.
 Both  in time and space species and groups of species have their points of  maximum development.
 Groups of species, living during the same period  of time, or living within the same area, are often characterised by  trifling features in common, as of sculpture or colour.
 In looking to  the long succession of past ages, as in looking to distant provinces  throughout the world, we find that species in certain classes differ  little from each other, whilst those in another class, or only in a  different section of the same order, differ greatly from each other.
 In  both time and space the lowly organised members of each class generally  change less than the highly organised; but there are in both cases  marked exceptions to the rule.
 According to our theory, these several  relations throughout time and space are intelligible; for whether we  look to the allied forms of life which have changed during successive  ages, or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant  quarters, in both cases they are connected by the same bond of ordinary  generation; in both cases the laws of variation have been the same,  and modifications have been accumulated by the same means of natural  selection.

      CLASSIFICATION.
    From the most remote period in the history of the world organic beings  have been found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that  they can be classed in groups under groups.
 This classification is  not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations.
 The  existence of groups would have been of simple significance, if one group  had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land, and another the water;  one to feed on flesh, another on vegetable matter, and so on; but the  case is widely different, for it is notorious how commonly members of  even the same subgroup have different habits.
 In the second and fourth  chapters, on Variation and on Natural Selection, I have attempted  to show that within each country it is the widely ranging, the much  diffused and common, that is the dominant species, belonging to  the larger genera in each class, which vary most.
 The varieties, or  incipient species, thus produced, ultimately become converted into new  and distinct species; and these, on the principle of inheritance, tend  to produce other new and dominant species.
 Consequently the groups which  are now large, and which generally include many dominant species, tend  to go on increasing in size.
 I further attempted to show that from the  varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as  different places as possible in the economy of nature, they constantly  tend to diverge in character.
 This latter conclusion is supported by  observing the great diversity of forms, which, in any small area, come  into the closest competition, and by certain facts in naturalisation.
    I attempted also to show that there is a steady tendency in the forms  which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant  and exterminate the preceding, less divergent and less improved forms.
  I request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as  formerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that  the inevitable result is, that the modified descendants proceeding from  one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups.
 In  the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus  including several species; and the whole of the genera along this upper  line form together one class, for all are descended from one ancient  parent, and, consequently, have inherited something in common.
 But the  three genera on the left hand have, on this same principle, much in  common, and form a subfamily, distinct from that containing the next  two genera on the right hand, which diverged from a common parent at  the fifth stage of descent.
 These five genera have also much in common,  though less than when grouped in subfamilies; and they form a family  distinct from that containing the three genera still further to the  right hand, which diverged at an earlier period.
 And all these genera,  descended from (A), form an order distinct from the genera descended  from (I).
 So that we here have many species descended from a single  progenitor grouped into genera; and the genera into subfamilies,  families and orders, all under one great class.
 The grand fact of the  natural subordination of organic beings in groups under groups, which,  from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in  my judgment thus explained.
 No doubt organic beings, like all other  objects, can be classed in many ways, either artificially by single  characters, or more naturally by a number of characters.
 We know,  for instance, that minerals and the elemental substances can be thus  arranged.
 In this case there is of course no relation to genealogical  succession, and no cause can at present be assigned for their falling  into groups.
 But with organic beings the case is different, and the view  above given accords with their natural arrangement in group under group;  and no other explanation has ever been attempted.
    Naturalists, as we have seen, try to arrange the species, genera and  families in each class, on what is called the Natural System.
 But what  is meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as a scheme for  arranging together those living objects which are most alike, and for  separating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial method of  enunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions--that is,  by one sentence to give the characters common, for instance, to all  mammals, by another those common to all carnivora, by another those  common to the dog-genus, and then, by adding a single sentence, a full  description is given of each kind of dog.
 The ingenuity and utility of  this system are indisputable.
 But many naturalists think that something  more is meant by the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the  plan of the Creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time  or space, or both, or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator,  it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge.
 Expressions  such as that famous one by Linnaeus, which we often meet with in a more  or less concealed form, namely, that the characters do not make the  genus, but that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that some  deeper bond is included in our classifications than mere resemblance.
  I believe that this is the case, and that community of descent--the one  known cause of close similarity in organic beings--is the bond, which,  though observed by various degrees of modification, is partially  revealed to us by our classifications.
    Let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the  difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification  either gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for  enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most  like each other.
 It might have been thought (and was in ancient times  thought) that those parts of the structure which determined the habits  of life, and the general place of each being in the economy of nature,  would be of very high importance in classification.
 Nothing can be more  false.
 No one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of  a dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance.
 These  resemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of the  being, are ranked as merely "adaptive or analogical characters;" but to  the consideration of these resemblances we shall recur.
 It may even be  given as a general rule, that the less any part of the organisation  is concerned with special habits, the more important it becomes for  classification.
 As an instance: Owen, in speaking of the dugong, says,  "The generative organs, being those which are most remotely related to  the habits and food of an animal, I have always regarded as affording  very clear indications of its true affinities.
 We are least likely in  the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an  essential character.
" With plants how remarkable it is that the organs  of vegetation, on which their nutrition and life depend, are of little  signification; whereas the organs of reproduction, with their product  the seed and embryo, are of paramount importance! So again, in formerly  discussing certain morphological characters which are not functionally  important, we have seen that they are often of the highest service in  classification.
 This depends on their constancy throughout many allied  groups; and their constancy chiefly depends on any slight deviations not  having been preserved and accumulated by natural selection, which acts  only on serviceable characters.
    That the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine  its classificatory value, is almost proved by the fact, that in allied  groups, in which the same organ, as we have every reason to suppose, has  nearly the same physiological value, its classificatory value is widely  different.
 No naturalist can have worked at any group without being  struck with this fact; and it has been fully acknowledged in the  writings of almost every author.
 It will suffice to quote the highest  authority, Robert Brown, who, in speaking of certain organs in the  Proteaceae, says their generic importance, "like that of all their  parts, not only in this, but, as I apprehend in every natural family,  is very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost.
" Again,  in another work he says, the genera of the Connaraceae "differ in having  one or more ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the  imbricate or valvular aestivation.
 Any one of these characters singly is  frequently of more than generic importance, though here even, when  all taken together, they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from  Connarus.
" To give an example among insects: in one great division  of the Hymenoptera, the antennae, as Westwood has remarked, are most  constant in structure; in another division they differ much, and the  differences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no one  will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the same order are  of unequal physiological importance.
 Any number of instances could be  given of the varying importance for classification of the same important  organ within the same group of beings.
    Again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high  physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this  condition are often of much value in classification.
 No one will dispute  that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants,  and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly serviceable in  exhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms.
 Robert  Brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the position of the  rudimentary florets is of the highest importance in the classification  of the Grasses.
    Numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which  must be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which  are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of  whole groups.
 For instance, whether or not there is an open passage from  the nostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to Owen, which  absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles--the inflection of the  angle of the lower jaw in Marsupials--the manner in which the wings of  insects are folded--mere colour in certain Algae--mere pubescence on  parts of the flower in grasses--the nature of the dermal covering, as  hair or feathers, in the Vertebrata.
 If the Ornithorhynchus had been  covered with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling  character would have been considered by naturalists as an important aid  in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to birds.
    The importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly  depends on their being correlated with many other characters of more or  less importance.
 The value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very  evident in natural history.
 Hence, as has often been remarked, a  species may depart from its allies in several characters, both of high  physiological importance, and of almost universal prevalence, and yet  leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked.
 Hence, also, it has been  found that a classification founded on any single character,  however important that may be, has always failed; for no part of the  organisation is invariably constant.
 The importance of an aggregate of  characters, even when none are important, alone explains the aphorism  enunciated by Linnaeus, namely, that the characters do not give the  genus, but the genus gives the character; for this seems founded on the  appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be  defined.
 Certain plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceae, bear perfect  and degraded flowers; in the latter, as A.
 de Jussieu has remarked, "The  greater number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus,  to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our  classification.
" When Aspicarpa produced in France, during several  years, only these degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number  of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the  order, yet M.
 Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that this  genus should still be retained among the Malpighiaceae.
 This case well  illustrates the spirit of our classifications.
    Practically, when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble  themselves about the physiological value of the characters which they  use in defining a group or in allocating any particular species.
 If they  find a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms,  and not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to  some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value.
 This principle  has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and  by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist, Aug.
 St.
 Hilaire.
  If several trifling characters are always found in combination, though  no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial  value is set on them.
 As in most groups of animals, important organs,  such as those for propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for  propagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as  highly serviceable in classification; but in some groups all these,  the most important vital organs, are found to offer characters of quite  subordinate value.
 Thus, as Fritz Muller has lately remarked, in the  same group of crustaceans, Cypridina is furnished with a heart, while in  two closely allied genera, namely Cypris and Cytherea, there is no such  organ; one species of Cypridina has well-developed branchiae, while  another species is destitute of them.
    We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of  equal importance with those derived from the adult, for a natural  classification of course includes all ages.
 But it is by no means  obvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should  be more important for this purpose than that of the adult, which alone  plays its full part in the economy of nature.
 Yet it has been strongly  urged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that  embryological characters are the most important of all; and this  doctrine has very generally been admitted as true.
 Nevertheless,  their importance has sometimes been exaggerated, owing to the adaptive  characters of larvae not having been excluded; in order to show this,  Fritz Muller arranged, by the aid of such characters alone, the great  class of crustaceans, and the arrangement did not prove a natural one.
  But there can be no doubt that embryonic, excluding larval characters,  are of the highest value for classification, not only with animals but  with plants.
 Thus the main divisions of flowering plants are founded on  differences in the embryo--on the number and position of the cotyledons,  and on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle.
 We shall  immediately see why these characters possess so high a value in  classification, namely, from the natural system being genealogical in  its arrangement.
    Our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of  affinities.
 Nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters  common to all birds; but with crustaceans, any such definition has  hitherto been found impossible.
 There are crustaceans at the opposite  ends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the  species at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to  others, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to  this, and to no other class of the Articulata.
    Geographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite  logically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of  closely allied forms.
 Temminck insists on the utility or even necessity  of this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed by  several entomologists and botanists.
    Finally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of  species, such as orders, suborders, families, subfamilies, and genera,  they seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary.
 Several of the  best botanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have strongly insisted  on their arbitrary value.
 Instances could be given among plants and  insects, of a group first ranked by practised naturalists as only a  genus, and then raised to the rank of a subfamily or family; and this  has been done, not because further research has detected important  structural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous  allied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have been  subsequently discovered.
    All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification may  be explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that  the natural system is founded on descent with modification--that the  characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between  any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from  a common parent, all true classification being genealogical--that  community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been  unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the  enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and  separating objects more or less alike.
    But I must explain my meaning more fully.
 I believe that the ARRANGEMENT  of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to  each other, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but  that the AMOUNT of difference in the several branches or groups, though  allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may  differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which  they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked  under different genera, families, sections or orders.
 The reader will  best understand what is meant, if he will take the trouble to refer to  the diagram in the fourth chapter.
 We will suppose the letters A to L  to represent allied genera existing during the Silurian epoch, and  descended from some still earlier form.
 In three of these genera (A,  F, and I) a species has transmitted modified descendants to the present  day, represented by the fifteen genera (a14 to z14) on the uppermost  horizontal line.
 Now, all these modified descendants from a single  species are related in blood or descent in the same degree.
 They may  metaphorically be called cousins to the same millionth degree, yet  they differ widely and in different degrees from each other.
 The forms  descended from A, now broken up into two or three families, constitute  a distinct order from those descended from I, also broken up into two  families.
 Nor can the existing species descended from A be ranked in  the same genus with the parent A, or those from I with parent I.
 But the  existing genus F14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified,  and it will then rank with the parent genus F; just as some few still  living organisms belong to Silurian genera.
 So that the comparative  value of the differences between these organic beings, which are all  related to each other in the same degree in blood, has come to be widely  different.
 Nevertheless, their genealogical ARRANGEMENT remains strictly  true, not only at the present time, but at each successive period  of descent.
 All the modified descendants from A will have inherited  something in common from their common parent, as will all the  descendants from I; so will it be with each subordinate branch of  descendants at each successive stage.
 If, however, we suppose any  descendant of A or of I to have become so much modified as to have  lost all traces of its parentage in this case, its place in the natural  system will be lost, as seems to have occurred with some few existing  organisms.
 All the descendants of the genus F, along its whole line of  descent, are supposed to have been but little modified, and they form  a single genus.
 But this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy  its proper intermediate position.
 The representation of the groups as  here given in the diagram on a flat surface, is much too simple.
 The  branches ought to have diverged in all directions.
 If the names of  the groups had been simply written down in a linear series the  representation would have been still less natural; and it is notoriously  not possible to represent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities  which we discover in nature among the beings of the same group.
 Thus,  the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree.
  But the amount of modification which the different groups have undergone  has to be expressed by ranking them under different so-called genera,  subfamilies, families, sections, orders, and classes.
    It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by  taking the case of languages.
 If we possessed a perfect pedigree of  mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the  best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the  world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly  changing dialects, were to be included, such an arrangement would be  the only possible one.
 Yet it might be that some ancient languages had  altered very little and had given rise to few new languages, whilst  others had altered much owing to the spreading, isolation and state of  civilisation of the several co-descended races, and had thus given rise  to many new dialects and languages.
 The various degrees of difference  between the languages of the same stock would have to be expressed by  groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even the only possible  arrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly  natural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and recent,  by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of  each tongue.
    In confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of  varieties, which are known or believed to be descended from a single  species.
 These are grouped under the species, with the subvarieties  under the varieties; and in some cases, as with the domestic pigeon,  with several other grades of difference.
 Nearly the same rules are  followed as in classifying species.
 Authors have insisted on the  necessity of arranging varieties on a natural instead of an artificial  system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of  the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most  important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the Swedish  and common turnip together, though the esculent and thickened stems  are so similar.
 Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in  classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns  are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less  variable than the shape or colour of the body, etc.
; whereas with sheep  the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant.
 In classing  varieties, I apprehend that if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical  classification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted  in some cases.
 For we might feel sure, whether there had been more or  less modification, that the principle of inheritance would keep the  forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points.
 In  tumbler pigeons, though some of the subvarieties differ in the important  character of the length of the beak, yet all are kept together from  having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has  nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any thought on  the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied  in blood and alike in some other respects.
    With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought  descent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade,  that of species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes  differ in the most important characters is known to every naturalist:  scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the adult males  and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, and yet no one dreams of  separating them.
 As soon as the three Orchidean forms, Monachanthus,  Myanthus, and Catasetum, which had previously been ranked as three  distinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced on the same plant,  they were immediately considered as varieties; and now I have been able  to show that they are the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of the  same species.
 The naturalist includes as one species the various larval  stages of the same individual, however much they may differ from each  other and from the adult; as well as the so-called alternate generations  of Steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be considered as  the same individual.
 He includes monsters and varieties, not from their  partial resemblance to the parent-form, but because they are descended  from it.
    As descent has universally been used in classing together the  individuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvae  are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in classing  varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable  amount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been  unconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under  higher groups, all under the so-called natural system? I believe it  has been unconsciously used; and thus only can I understand the several  rules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists.
  As we have no written pedigrees, we are forced to trace community  of descent by resemblances of any kind.
 Therefore, we choose those  characters which are the least likely to have been modified, in relation  to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently  exposed.
 Rudimentary structures on this view are as good as, or even  sometimes better than other parts of the organisation.
 We care not how  trifling a character may be--let it be the mere inflection of the angle  of the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded, whether the  skin be covered by hair or feathers--if it prevail throughout many and  different species, especially those having very different habits of  life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its presence in so  many forms with such different habits, only by inheritance from a  common parent.
 We may err in this respect in regard to single points of  structure, but when several characters, let them be ever so trifling,  concur throughout a large group of beings having different habits, we  may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that these characters  have been inherited from a common ancestor; and we know that such  aggregated characters have especial value in classification.
    We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart from  its allies, in several of its most important characteristics, and yet be  safely classed with them.
 This may be safely done, and is often done,  as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so  unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent.
 Let two  forms have not a single character in common, yet, if these extreme forms  are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at  once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same  class.
 As we find organs of high physiological importance--those  which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of  existence--are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to  them; but if these same organs, in another group or section of a  group, are found to differ much, we at once value them less in our  classification.
 We shall presently see why embryological characters are  of such high classificatory importance.
 Geographical distribution  may sometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large genera,  because all the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and  isolated region, are in all probability descended from the same parents.
    ANALOGICAL RESEMBLANCES.
    We can understand, on the above views, the very important distinction  between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances.
 Lamarck  first called attention to this subject, and he has been ably followed by  Macleay and others.
 The resemblance in the shape of the body and in the  fin-like anterior limbs between dugongs and whales, and between these  two orders of mammals and fishes, are analogical.
 So is the resemblance  between a mouse and a shrew-mouse (Sorex), which belong to different  orders; and the still closer resemblance, insisted on by Mr. Mivart,  between the mouse and a small marsupial animal (Antechinus) of  Australia.
 These latter resemblances may be accounted for, as it seems  to me, by adaptation for similarly active movements through thickets and  herbage, together with concealment from enemies.
    Among insects there are innumerable instances; thus Linnaeus, misled by  external appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth.
  We see something of the same kind even with our domestic varieties, as  in the strikingly similar shape of the body in the improved breeds of  the Chinese and common pig, which are descended from distinct species;  and in the similarly thickened stems of the common and specifically  distinct Swedish turnip.
 The resemblance between the greyhound and  race-horse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been  drawn by some authors between widely different animals.
    On the view of characters being of real importance for classification,  only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why  analogical or adaptive characters, although of the utmost importance to  the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist.
  For animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may have  become adapted to similar conditions, and thus have assumed a close  external resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal--will rather  tend to conceal their blood-relationship.
 We can thus also understand  the apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when  one group is compared with another, but give true affinities when the  members of the same group are compared together: thus the shape of the  body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared  with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through  the water; but between the the several members of the whale family, the  shape of the body and the fin-like limbs offer characters exhibiting  true affinity; for as these parts are so nearly similar throughout  the whole family, we cannot doubt that they have been inherited from a  common ancestor.
 So it is with fishes.
    Numerous cases could be given of striking resemblances in quite distinct  beings between single parts or organs, which have been adapted for the  same functions.
 A good instance is afforded by the close resemblance of  the jaws of the dog and Tasmanian wolf or Thylacinus--animals which are  widely sundered in the natural system.
 But this resemblance is confined  to general appearance, as in the prominence of the canines, and in the  cutting shape of the molar teeth.
 For the teeth really differ much: thus  the dog has on each side of the upper jaw four pre-molars and only two  molars; while the Thylacinus has three pre-molars and four molars.
  The molars also differ much in the two animals in relative size and  structure.
 The adult dentition is preceded by a widely different milk  dentition.
 Any one may, of course, deny that the teeth in either case  have been adapted for tearing flesh, through the natural selection of  successive variations; but if this be admitted in the one case, it is  unintelligible to me that it should be denied in the other.
 I am glad to  find that so high an authority as Professor Flower has come to this same  conclusion.
    The extraordinary cases given in a former chapter, of widely different  fishes possessing electric organs--of widely different insects  possessing luminous organs--and of orchids and asclepiads having  pollen-masses with viscid discs, come under this same head of analogical  resemblances.
 But these cases are so wonderful that they were introduced  as difficulties or objections to our theory.
 In all such cases some  fundamental difference in the growth or development of the parts, and  generally in their matured structure, can be detected.
 The end gained is  the same, but the means, though appearing superficially to be the same,  are essentially different.
 The principle formerly alluded to under the  term of ANALOGICAL VARIATION has probably in these cases often come into  play; that is, the members of the same class, although only distantly  allied, have inherited so much in common in their constitution, that  they are apt to vary under similar exciting causes in a similar  manner; and this would obviously aid in the acquirement through natural  selection of parts or organs, strikingly like each other, independently  of their direct inheritance from a common progenitor.
    As species belonging to distinct classes have often been adapted  by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar  circumstances--to inhabit, for instance, the three elements of land,  air and water--we can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical  parallelism has sometimes been observed between the subgroups of  distinct classes.
 A naturalist, struck with a parallelism of this  nature, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in  several classes (and all our experience shows that their valuation is as  yet arbitrary), could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range;  and thus the septenary, quinary, quaternary and ternary classifications  have probably arisen.
    There is another and curious class of cases in which close external  resemblance does not depend on adaptation to similar habits of life, but  has been gained for the sake of protection.
 I allude to the wonderful  manner in which certain butterflies imitate, as first described by Mr.  Bates, other and quite distinct species.
 This excellent observer has  shown that in some districts of South America, where, for instance, an  Ithomia abounds in gaudy swarms, another butterfly, namely, a Leptalis,  is often found mingled in the same flock; and the latter so closely  resembles the Ithomia in every shade and stripe of colour, and even  in the shape of its wings, that Mr. Bates, with his eyes sharpened  by collecting during eleven years, was, though always on his guard,  continually deceived.
 When the mockers and the mocked are caught and  compared, they are found to be very different in essential structure,  and to belong not only to distinct genera, but often to distinct  families.
 Had this mimicry occurred in only one or two instances, it  might have been passed over as a strange coincidence.
 But, if we proceed  from a district where one Leptalis imitates an Ithomia, another mocking  and mocked species, belonging to the same two genera, equally close in  their resemblance, may be found.
 Altogether no less than ten genera are  enumerated, which include species that imitate other butterflies.
 The  mockers and mocked always inhabit the same region; we never find an  imitator living remote from the form which it imitates.
 The mockers are  almost invariably rare insects; the mocked in almost every case abounds  in swarms.
 In the same district in which a species of Leptalis closely  imitates an Ithomia, there are sometimes other Lepidoptera mimicking  the same Ithomia: so that in the same place, species of three genera of  butterflies and even a moth are found all closely resembling a butterfly  belonging to a fourth genus.
 It deserves especial notice that many of  the mimicking forms of the Leptalis, as well as of the mimicked forms,  can be shown by a graduated series to be merely varieties of the same  species; while others are undoubtedly distinct species.
 But why, it may  be asked, are certain forms treated as the mimicked and others as the  mimickers? Mr. Bates satisfactorily answers this question by showing  that the form which is imitated keeps the usual dress of the group to  which it belongs, while the counterfeiters have changed their dress and  do not resemble their nearest allies.
    We are next led to enquire what reason can be assigned for certain  butterflies and moths so often assuming the dress of another and  quite distinct form; why, to the perplexity of naturalists, has nature  condescended to the tricks of the stage? Mr. Bates has, no doubt, hit on  the true explanation.
 The mocked forms, which always abound in numbers,  must habitually escape destruction to a large extent, otherwise they  could not exist in such swarms; and a large amount of evidence has now  been collected, showing that they are distasteful to birds and other  insect-devouring animals.
 The mocking forms, on the other hand, that  inhabit the same district, are comparatively rare, and belong to  rare groups; hence, they must suffer habitually from some danger, for  otherwise, from the number of eggs laid by all butterflies, they would  in three or four generations swarm over the whole country.
 Now if a  member of one of these persecuted and rare groups were to assume a dress  so like that of a well-protected species that it continually deceived  the practised eyes of an entomologist, it would often deceive predaceous  birds and insects, and thus often escape destruction.
 Mr. Bates may  almost be said to have actually witnessed the process by which the  mimickers have come so closely to resemble the mimicked; for he  found that some of the forms of Leptalis which mimic so many other  butterflies, varied in an extreme degree.
 In one district several  varieties occurred, and of these one alone resembled, to a certain  extent, the common Ithomia of the same district.
 In another district  there were two or three varieties, one of which was much commoner than  the others, and this closely mocked another form of Ithomia.
 From facts  of this nature, Mr. Bates concludes that the Leptalis first varies; and  when a variety happens to resemble in some degree any common butterfly  inhabiting the same district, this variety, from its resemblance to a  flourishing and little persecuted kind, has a better chance of escaping  destruction from predaceous birds and insects, and is consequently  oftener preserved; "the less perfect degrees of resemblance being  generation after generation eliminated, and only the others left to  propagate their kind.
" So that here we have an excellent illustration of  natural selection.
    Messrs.
 Wallace and Trimen have likewise described several equally  striking cases of imitation in the Lepidoptera of the Malay Archipelago  and Africa, and with some other insects.
 Mr. Wallace has also detected  one such case with birds, but we have none with the larger quadrupeds.
  The much greater frequency of imitation with insects than with other  animals, is probably the consequence of their small size; insects cannot  defend themselves, excepting indeed the kinds furnished with a sting,  and I have never heard of an instance of such kinds mocking other  insects, though they are mocked; insects cannot easily escape by  flight from the larger animals which prey on them; therefore, speaking  metaphorically, they are reduced, like most weak creatures, to trickery  and dissimulation.
    It should be observed that the process of imitation probably never  commenced between forms widely dissimilar in colour.
 But, starting with  species already somewhat like each other, the closest resemblance,  if beneficial, could readily be gained by the above means, and if  the imitated form was subsequently and gradually modified through any  agency, the imitating form would be led along the same track, and thus  be altered to almost any extent, so that it might ultimately assume an  appearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the other members of the  family to which it belonged.
 There is, however, some difficulty on this  head, for it is necessary to suppose in some cases that ancient members  belonging to several distinct groups, before they had diverged to their  present extent, accidentally resembled a member of another and protected  group in a sufficient degree to afford some slight protection, this  having given the basis for the subsequent acquisition of the most  perfect resemblance.
    ON THE NATURE OF THE AFFINITIES CONNECTING ORGANIC BEINGS.
    As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger  genera, tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which  they belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to  spread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of  nature.
 The larger and more dominant groups within each class thus tend  to go on increasing in size, and they consequently supplant many  smaller and feebler groups.
 Thus, we can account for the fact that all  organisms, recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders and  under still fewer classes.
 As showing how few the higher groups are in  number, and how widely they are spread throughout the world, the fact  is striking that the discovery of Australia has not added an insect  belonging to a new class, and that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn  from Dr.
 Hooker, it has added only two or three families of small size.
    In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the  principle of each group having generally diverged much in character  during the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the  more ancient forms of life often present characters in some degree  intermediate between existing groups.
 As some few of the old and  intermediate forms having transmitted to the present day descendants  but little modified, these constitute our so-called osculant or aberrant  groups.
 The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of  connecting forms which have been exterminated and utterly lost.
 And  we have evidence of aberrant groups having suffered severely from  extinction, for they are almost always represented by extremely few  species; and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from  each other, which again implies extinction.
 The genera Ornithorhynchus  and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less aberrant had  each been represented by a dozen species, instead of as at present by a  single one, or by two or three.
 We can, I think, account for this fact  only by looking at aberrant groups as forms which have been conquered  by more successful competitors, with a few members still preserved under  unusually favourable conditions.
    Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one group of  animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity  in most cases is general and not special: thus, according to Mr.  Waterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to  Marsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its  relations are general, that is, not to any one Marsupial species more  than to another.
 As these points of affinity are believed to be real  and not merely adaptive, they must be due in accordance with our view to  inheritance from a common progenitor.
 Therefore, we must suppose either  that all Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some ancient  Marsupial, which will naturally have been more or less intermediate in  character with respect to all existing Marsupials; or that both Rodents  and Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both  groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions.
  On either view we must suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by  inheritance, more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have  other Rodents; and therefore it will not be specially related to any one  existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from  having partially retained the character of their common progenitor, or  of some early member of the group.
 On the other hand, of all Marsupials,  as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the Phascolomys resembles most nearly,  not any one species, but the general order of Rodents.
 In this case,  however, it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only  analogical, owing to the Phascolomys having become adapted to habits  like those of a Rodent.
 The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar  observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct  families of plants.
    On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in  character of the species descended from a common progenitor, together  with their retention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can  understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all  the members of the same family or higher group are connected together.
  For the common progenitor of a whole family, now broken up by extinction  into distinct groups and subgroups, will have transmitted some of its  characters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all the species;  and they will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines  of affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often  referred to), mounting up through many predecessors.
 As it is difficult  to show the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred of any  ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and  almost impossible to do so without this aid, we can understand  the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in  describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which  they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same  great natural class.
    Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an  important part in defining and widening the intervals between the  several groups in each class.
 We may thus account for the distinctness  of whole classes from each other--for instance, of birds from all other  vertebrate animals--by the belief that many ancient forms of life have  been utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds were  formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other and at that  time less differentiated vertebrate classes.
 There has been much  less extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with  Batrachians.
 There has been still less within some whole classes, for  instance the Crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms  are still linked together by a long and only partially broken chain of  affinities.
 Extinction has only defined the groups: it has by no means  made them; for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were  suddenly to reappear, though it would be quite impossible to give  definitions by which each group could be distinguished, still a natural  classification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be possible.
  We shall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, A to L, may  represent eleven Silurian genera, some of which have produced large  groups of modified descendants, with every link in each branch and  sub-branch still alive; and the links not greater than those between  existing varieties.
 In this case it would be quite impossible to give  definitions by which the several members of the several groups could be  distinguished from their more immediate parents and descendants.
 Yet the  arrangement in the diagram would still hold good and would be natural;  for, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms descended, for  instance from A, would have something in common.
 In a tree we can  distinguish this or that branch, though at the actual fork the two unite  and blend together.
 We could not, as I have said, define the several  groups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing most of  the characters of each group, whether large or small, and thus give a  general idea of the value of the differences between them.
 This is what  we should be driven to, if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the  forms in any one class which have lived throughout all time and space.
  Assuredly we shall never succeed in making so perfect a collection:  nevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending toward this end;  and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an able paper, on the high  importance of looking to types, whether or not we can separate and  define the groups to which such types belong.
    Finally, we have seen that natural selection, which follows from the  struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably leads to  extinction and divergence of character in the descendants from any  one parent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the  affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group  under group.
 We use the element of descent in classing the individuals  of both sexes and of all ages under one species, although they may have  but few characters in common; we use descent in classing acknowledged  varieties, however different they may be from their parents; and I  believe that this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion  which naturalists have sought under the term of the Natural System.
  On this idea of the natural system being, in so far as it has been  perfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with the grades of  difference expressed by the terms genera, families, orders, etc.
, we  can understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our  classification.
 We can understand why we value certain resemblances far  more than others; why we use rudimentary and useless organs, or others  of trifling physiological importance; why, in finding the relations  between one group and another, we summarily reject analogical or  adaptive characters, and yet use these same characters within the limits  of the same group.
 We can clearly see how it is that all living and  extinct forms can be grouped together within a few great classes; and  how the several members of each class are connected together by the most  complex and radiating lines of affinities.
 We shall never, probably,  disentangle the inextricable web of the affinities between the members  of any one class; but when we have a distinct object in view, and do not  look to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope to make sure but slow  progress.
    Professor Haeckel in his "Generelle Morphologie" and in another works,  has recently brought his great knowledge and abilities to bear on what  he calls phylogeny, or the lines of descent of all organic beings.
  In drawing up the several series he trusts chiefly to embryological  characters, but receives aid from homologous and rudimentary organs, as  well as from the successive periods at which the various forms of life  are believed to have first appeared in our geological formations.
 He has  thus boldly made a great beginning, and shows us how classification will  in the future be treated.
    MORPHOLOGY.
    We have seen that the members of the same class, independently of  their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their  organisation.
 This resemblance is often expressed by the term "unity of  type;" or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different  species of the class are homologous.
 The whole subject is included under  the general term of Morphology.
 This is one of the most interesting  departments of natural history, and may almost be said to be its very  soul.
 What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for  grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle  of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on  the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative  positions? How curious it is, to give a subordinate though striking  instance, that the hind feet of the kangaroo, which are so well fitted  for bounding over the open plains--those of the climbing, leaf-eating  koala, equally well fitted for grasping the branches of trees--those  of the ground-dwelling, insect or root-eating, bandicoots--and those of  some other Australian marsupials--should all be constructed on the same  extraordinary type, namely with the bones of the second and third digits  extremely slender and enveloped within the same skin, so that they  appear like a single toe furnished with two claws.
 Notwithstanding this  similarity of pattern, it is obvious that the hind feet of these several  animals are used for as widely different purposes as it is possible to  conceive.
 The case is rendered all the more striking by the American  opossums, which follow nearly the same habits of life as some of their  Australian relatives, having feet constructed on the ordinary plan.
  Professor Flower, from whom these statements are taken, remarks in  conclusion: "We may call this conformity to type, without getting much  nearer to an explanation of the phenomenon;" and he then adds "but is  it not powerfully suggestive of true relationship, of inheritance from a  common ancestor?"    Geoffroy St.
 Hilaire has strongly insisted on the high importance of  relative position or connexion in homologous parts; they may differ to  almost any extent in form and size, and yet remain connected together in  the same invariable order.
 We never find, for instance, the bones of  the arm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed.
 Hence the same  names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals.
  We see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects:  what can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a  sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws  of a beetle? Yet all these organs, serving for such widely different  purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper  lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae.
 The same law governs the  construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans.
 So it is with the  flowers of plants.
    Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity  of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine  of final causes.
 The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly  admitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the "Nature of Limbs.
"  On the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can  only say that so it is; that it has pleased the Creator to construct all  the animals and plants in each great class on a uniform plan; but this  is not a scientific explanation.
    The explanation is to a large extent simple, on the theory of the  selection of successive slight modifications, each being profitable in  some way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation other  parts of the organisation.
 In changes of this nature, there will be  little or no tendency to alter the original pattern, or to transpose  the parts.
 The bones of a limb might be shortened and flattened to any  extent, becoming at the same time enveloped in thick membrane, so as to  serve as a fin; or a webbed hand might have all its bones, or certain  bones, lengthened to any extent, with the membrane connecting them  increased, so as to serve as a wing; yet all these modifications would  not tend to alter the framework of the bones or the relative connexion  of the parts.
 If we suppose that an early progenitor--the archetype,  as it may be called--of all mammals, birds and reptiles, had its limbs  constructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose  they served, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the  homologous construction of the limbs throughout the class.
 So with the  mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common progenitor  had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae, these parts  being perhaps very simple in form; and then natural selection will  account for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the  mouths of insects.
 Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general  pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost,  by the reduction and ultimately by the complete abortion of  certain parts, by the fusion of other parts, and by the doubling or  multiplication of others, variations which we know to be within  the limits of possibility.
 In the paddles of the gigantic extinct  sea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the  general pattern seems thus to have become partially obscured.
    There is another and equally curious branch of our subject; namely,  serial homologies, or the comparison of the different parts or organs  in the same individual, and not of the same parts or organs in different  members of the same class.
 Most physiologists believe that the bones of  the skull are homologous--that is, correspond in number and in relative  connexion--with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae.
  The anterior and posterior limbs in all the higher vertebrate classes  are plainly homologous.
 So it is with the wonderfully complex jaws  and legs of crustaceans.
 It is familiar to almost every one, that in  a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and  pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible on the  view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire.
 In  monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one  organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see, during  the early or embryonic stages of development in flowers, as well as  in crustaceans and many other animals, that organs, which when mature  become extremely different are at first exactly alike.
    How inexplicable are the cases of serial homologies on the ordinary view  of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of  such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone apparently  representing vertebrae? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived  from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition by  mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of  birds and reptiles.
 Why should similar bones have been created to  form the wing and the leg of a bat, used as they are for such  totally different purposes, namely flying and walking? Why should one  crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts,  consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many  legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and  pistils, in each flower, though fitted for such distinct purposes, be  all constructed on the same pattern?    On the theory of natural selection, we can, to a certain extent, answer  these questions.
 We need not here consider how the bodies of some  animals first became divided into a series of segments, or how they  became divided into right and left sides, with corresponding organs, for  such questions are almost beyond investigation.
 It is, however, probable  that some serial structures are the result of cells multiplying by  division, entailing the multiplication of the parts developed from  such cells.
 It must suffice for our purpose to bear in mind that  an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common  characteristic, as Owen has remarked, of all low or little specialised  forms; therefore the unknown progenitor of the Vertebrata probably  possessed many vertebrae; the unknown progenitor of the Articulata, many  segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants, many leaves  arranged in one or more spires.
 We have also formerly seen that parts  many times repeated are eminently liable to vary, not only in number,  but in form.
 Consequently such parts, being already present in  considerable numbers, and being highly variable, would naturally afford  the materials for adaptation to the most different purposes; yet they  would generally retain, through the force of inheritance, plain traces  of their original or fundamental resemblance.
 They would retain this  resemblance all the more, as the variations, which afforded the basis  for their subsequent modification through natural selection, would  tend from the first to be similar; the parts being at an early stage of  growth alike, and being subjected to nearly the same conditions.
 Such  parts, whether more or less modified, unless their common origin became  wholly obscured, would be serially homologous.
    In the great class of molluscs, though the parts in distinct species  can be shown to be homologous, only a few serial homologies; such as the  valves of Chitons, can be indicated; that is, we are seldom enabled  to say that one part is homologous with another part in the same  individual.
 And we can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even  in the lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much  indefinite repetition of any one part as we find in the other great  classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
    But morphology is a much more complex subject than it at first appears,  as has lately been well shown in a remarkable paper by Mr. E.
 Ray  Lankester, who has drawn an important distinction between certain  classes of cases which have all been equally ranked by naturalists as  homologous.
 He proposes to call the structures which resemble each other  in distinct animals, owing to their descent from a common progenitor  with subsequent modification, "homogenous"; and the resemblances which  cannot thus be accounted for, he proposes to call "homoplastic".
 For  instance, he believes that the hearts of birds and mammals are as a  whole homogenous--that is, have been derived from a common progenitor;  but that the four cavities of the heart in the two classes are  homoplastic--that is, have been independently developed.
 Mr. Lankester  also adduces the close resemblance of the parts on the right and left  sides of the body, and in the successive segments of the same individual  animal; and here we have parts commonly called homologous which bear no  relation to the descent of distinct species from a common progenitor.
  Homoplastic structures are the same with those which I have classed,  though in a very imperfect manner, as analogous modifications or  resemblances.
 Their formation may be attributed in part to distinct  organisms, or to distinct parts of the same organism, having varied in  an analogous manner; and in part to similar modifications, having  been preserved for the same general purpose or function, of which many  instances have been given.
    Naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed  vertebrae; the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and  pistils in flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in most cases  be more correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak of both  skull and vertebrae, jaws and legs, etc.
, as having been metamorphosed,  not one from the other, as they now exist, but from some common and  simpler element.
 Most naturalists, however, use such language only in a  metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that during a long course  of descent, primordial organs of any kind--vertebrae in the one case and  legs in the other--have actually been converted into skulls or jaws.
 Yet  so strong is the appearance of this having occurred that naturalists  can hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification.
  According to the views here maintained, such language may be used  literally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab  retaining numerous characters, which they probably would have retained  through inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed from true  though extremely simple legs, is in part explained.
    DEVELOPMENT AND EMBRYOLOGY.
    This is one of the most important subjects in the whole round of natural  history.
 The metamorphoses of insects, with which every one is familiar,  are generally effected abruptly by a few stages; but the transformations  are in reality numerous and gradual, though concealed.
 A certain  ephemerous insect (Chloeon) during its development, moults, as shown by  Sir J.
 Lubbock, above twenty times, and each time undergoes a certain  amount of change; and in this case we see the act of metamorphosis  performed in a primary and gradual manner.
 Many insects, and especially  certain crustaceans, show us what wonderful changes of structure can be  effected during development.
 Such changes, however, reach their acme in  the so-called alternate generations of some of the lower animals.
 It is,  for instance, an astonishing fact that a delicate branching coralline,  studded with polypi, and attached to a submarine rock, should produce,  first by budding and then by transverse division, a host of huge  floating jelly-fishes; and that these should produce eggs, from which  are hatched swimming animalcules, which attach themselves to rocks and  become developed into branching corallines; and so on in an endless  cycle.
 The belief in the essential identity of the process of alternate  generation and of ordinary metamorphosis has been greatly strengthened  by Wagner's discovery of the larva or maggot of a fly, namely the  Cecidomyia, producing asexually other larvae, and these others, which  finally are developed into mature males and females, propagating their  kind in the ordinary manner by eggs.
    It may be worth notice that when Wagner's remarkable discovery was first  announced, I was asked how was it possible to account for the larvae of  this fly having acquired the power of a sexual reproduction.
 As long as  the case remained unique no answer could be given.
 But already Grimm has  shown that another fly, a Chironomus, reproduces itself in nearly the  same manner, and he believes that this occurs frequently in the order.
  It is the pupa, and not the larva, of the Chironomus which has this  power; and Grimm further shows that this case, to a certain extent,  "unites that of the Cecidomyia with the parthenogenesis of the  Coccidae;" the term parthenogenesis implying that the mature females of  the Coccidae are capable of producing fertile eggs without the concourse  of the male.
 Certain animals belonging to several classes are now known  to have the power of ordinary reproduction at an unusually early age;  and we have only to accelerate parthenogenetic reproduction by gradual  steps to an earlier and earlier age--Chironomus showing us an almost  exactly intermediate stage, viz.
, that of the pupa--and we can perhaps  account for the marvellous case of the Cecidomyia.
    It has already been stated that various parts in the same individual,  which are exactly alike during an early embryonic period, become widely  different and serve for widely different purposes in the adult state.
 So  again it has been shown that generally the embryos of the most distinct  species belonging to the same class are closely similar, but become,  when fully developed, widely dissimilar.
 A better proof of this latter  fact cannot be given than the statement by Von Baer that "the embryos of  mammalia, of birds, lizards and snakes, probably also of chelonia, are  in the earliest states exceedingly like one another, both as a whole and  in the mode of development of their parts; so much so, in fact, that we  can often distinguish the embryos only by their size.
 In my possession  are two little embryos in spirit, whose names I have omitted to attach,  and at present I am quite unable to say to what class they belong.
 They  may be lizards or small birds, or very young mammalia, so complete is  the similarity in the mode of formation of the head and trunk in these  animals.
 The extremities, however, are still absent in these embryos.
  But even if they had existed in the earliest stage of their development  we should learn nothing, for the feet of lizards and mammals, the wings  and feet of birds, no less than the hands and feet of man, all arise  from the same fundamental form.
" The larvae of most crustaceans, at  corresponding stages of development, closely resemble each other,  however different the adults may become; and so it is with very many  other animals.
 A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance occasionally  lasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the same genus, and of  allied genera, often resemble each other in their immature plumage; as  we see in the spotted feathers in the young of the thrush group.
 In  the cat tribe, most of the species when adult are striped or spotted in  lines; and stripes or spots can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of  the lion and the puma.
 We occasionally, though rarely, see something of  the same kind in plants; thus the first leaves of the ulex or furze, and  the first leaves of the phyllodineous acacias, are pinnate or divided  like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosae.
    The points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different  animals within the same class resemble each other, often have no direct  relation to their conditions of existence.
 We cannot, for instance,  suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like  courses of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar  conditions--in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its  mother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the  spawn of a frog under water.
 We have no more reason to believe in such a  relation than we have to believe that the similar bones in the hand of  a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar  conditions of life.
 No one supposes that the stripes on the whelp of  a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these  animals.
    The case, however, is different when an animal, during any part of its  embryonic career, is active, and has to provide for itself.
 The period  of activity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes  on, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as  perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal.
 In how important a  manner this has acted, has recently been well shown by Sir J.
 Lubbock  in his remarks on the close similarity of the larvae of some insects  belonging to very different orders, and on the dissimilarity of the  larvae of other insects within the same order, according to their habits  of life.
 Owing to such adaptations the similarity of the larvae of  allied animals is sometimes greatly obscured; especially when there is  a division of labour during the different stages of development, as  when the same larva has during one stage to search for food, and during  another stage has to search for a place of attachment.
 Cases can even be  given of the larvae of allied species, or groups of species, differing  more from each other than do the adults.
 In most cases, however, the  larvae, though active, still obey, more or less closely, the law of  common embryonic resemblance.
 Cirripedes afford a good instance of  this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was  a crustacean: but a glance at the larva shows this in an unmistakable  manner.
 So again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the pedunculated  and sessile, though differing widely in external appearance, have larvae  in all their stages barely distinguishable.
    The embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation.
  I use this expression, though I am aware that it is hardly possible to  define clearly what is meant by organisation being higher or lower.
  But no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than  the caterpillar.
 In some cases, however, the mature animal must be  considered as lower in the scale than the larva, as with certain  parasitic crustaceans.
 To refer once again to cirripedes: the larvae in  the first stage have three pairs of locomotive organs, a simple single  eye, and a probosciformed mouth, with which they feed largely, for they  increase much in size.
 In the second stage, answering to the chrysalis  stage of butterflies, they have six pairs of beautifully constructed  natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and extremely  complex antennae; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth, and  cannot feed: their function at this stage is, to search out by their  well-developed organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers  of swimming, a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo  their final metamorphosis.
 When this is completed they are fixed for  life: their legs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again  obtain a well-constructed mouth; but they have no antennae, and their  two eyes are now reconverted into a minute, single, simple eye-spot.
  In this last and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as  either more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the  larval condition.
 But in some genera the larvae become developed into  hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what I have called  complemental males; and in the latter the development has assuredly been  retrograde; for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short time  and is destitute of mouth, stomach, and every other organ of importance,  excepting those for reproduction.
    We are so much accustomed to see a difference in structure between the  embryo and the adult, that we are tempted to look at this difference as  in some necessary manner contingent on growth.
 But there is no reason  why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should  not have been sketched out with all their parts in proper proportion, as  soon as any part became visible.
 In some whole groups of animals and in  certain members of other groups this is the case, and the embryo does  not at any period differ widely from the adult: thus Owen has remarked  in regard to cuttle-fish, "there is no metamorphosis; the cephalopodic  character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are  completed.
" Land-shells and fresh-water crustaceans are born having  their proper forms, while the marine members of the same two great  classes pass through considerable and often great changes during their  development.
 Spiders, again, barely undergo any metamorphosis.
 The  larvae of most insects pass through a worm-like stage, whether they are  active and adapted to diversified habits, or are inactive from being  placed in the midst of proper nutriment, or from being fed by their  parents; but in some few cases, as in that of Aphis, if we look to  the admirable drawings of the development of this insect, by Professor  Huxley, we see hardly any trace of the vermiform stage.
    Sometimes it is only the earlier developmental stages which fail.
 Thus,  Fritz Muller has made the remarkable discovery that certain shrimp-like  crustaceans (allied to Penoeus) first appear under the simple  nauplius-form, and after passing through two or more zoea-stages, and  then through the mysis-stage, finally acquire their mature structure:  now in the whole great malacostracan order, to which these crustaceans  belong, no other member is as yet known to be first developed under the  nauplius-form, though many appear as zoeas; nevertheless Muller assigns  reasons for his belief, that if there had been no suppression of  development, all these crustaceans would have appeared as nauplii.
    How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology--namely, the  very general, though not universal, difference in structure between the  embryo and the adult; the various parts in the same individual embryo,  which ultimately become very unlike, and serve for diverse purposes,  being at an early period of growth alike; the common, but not  invariable, resemblance between the embryos or larvae of the most  distinct species in the same class; the embryo often retaining, while  within the egg or womb, structures which are of no service to it, either  at that or at a later period of life; on the other hand, larvae which  have to provide for their own wants, being perfectly adapted to the  surrounding conditions; and lastly, the fact of certain larvae standing  higher in the scale of organisation than the mature animal into which  they are developed? I believe that all these facts can be explained as  follows.
    It is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities affecting the embryo  at a very early period, that slight variations or individual differences  necessarily appear at an equally early period.
 We have little evidence  on this head, but what we have certainly points the other way; for it  is notorious that breeders of cattle, horses and various fancy animals,  cannot positively tell, until some time after birth, what will be the  merits and demerits of their young animals.
 We see this plainly in our  own children; we cannot tell whether a child will be tall or short, or  what its precise features will be.
 The question is not, at what period  of life any variation may have been caused, but at what period the  effects are displayed.
 The cause may have acted, and I believe often has  acted, on one or both parents before the act of generation.
 It deserves  notice that it is of no importance to a very young animal, as long as it  is nourished and protected by its parent, whether most of its characters  are acquired a little earlier or later in life.
 It would not signify,  for instance, to a bird which obtained its food by having a much-curved  beak whether or not while young it possessed a beak of this shape, as  long as it was fed by its parents.
    I have stated in the first chapter, that at whatever age any variation  first appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age  in the offspring.
 Certain variations can only appear at corresponding  ages; for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago  states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the full-grown horns of cattle.
  But variations which, for all that we can see might have appeared either  earlier or later in life, likewise tend to reappear at a corresponding  age in the offspring and parent.
 I am far from meaning that this is  invariably the case, and I could give several exceptional cases of  variations (taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened  at an earlier age in the child than in the parent.
    These two principles, namely, that slight variations generally appear  at a not very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding  not early period, explain, as I believe, all the above specified leading  facts in embryology.
 But first let us look to a few analogous cases in  our domestic varieties.
 Some authors who have written on Dogs maintain  that the greyhound and bull-dog, though so different, are really closely  allied varieties, descended from the same wild stock, hence I was  curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other.
 I was  told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and  this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually  measuring the old dogs and their six-days-old puppies, I found that  the puppies had not acquired nearly their full amount of proportional  difference.
 So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and  race-horses--breeds which have been almost wholly formed by selection  under domestication--differed as much as the full-grown animals; but  having had careful measurements made of the dams and of three-days-old  colts of race and heavy cart-horses, I find that this is by no means the  case.
    As we have conclusive evidence that the breeds of the Pigeon are  descended from a single wild species, I compared the young pigeons  within twelve hours after being hatched.
 I carefully measured the  proportions (but will not here give the details) of the beak, width of  mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg,  in the wild parent species, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons,  carriers, and tumblers.
 Now, some of these birds, when mature, differ in  so extraordinary a manner in the length and form of beak, and in other  characters, that they would certainly have been ranked as distinct  genera if found in a state of nature.
 But when the nestling birds of  these several breeds were placed in a row, though most of them could  just be distinguished, the proportional differences in the above  specified points were incomparably less than in the full-grown birds.
  Some characteristic points of difference--for instance, that of the  width of mouth--could hardly be detected in the young.
 But there was  one remarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced  tumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon, and of the  other breeds, in almost exactly the same proportions as in the adult  stage.
    These facts are explained by the above two principles.
 Fanciers select  their dogs, horses, pigeons, etc.
, for breeding, when nearly grown up.
  They are indifferent whether the desired qualities are acquired earlier  or later in life, if the full-grown animal possesses them.
 And the  cases just given, more especially that of the pigeons, show that  the characteristic differences which have been accumulated by man's  selection, and which give value to his breeds, do not generally appear  at a very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding not  early period.
 But the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve  hours old possessed its proper characters, proves that this is not the  universal rule; for here the characteristic differences must either have  appeared at an earlier period than usual, or, if not so, the differences  must have been inherited, not at a corresponding, but at an earlier age.
    Now, let us apply these two principles to species in a state of nature.
  Let us take a group of birds, descended from some ancient form and  modified through natural selection for different habits.
 Then, from  the many slight successive variations having supervened in the several  species at a not early age, and having been inherited at a corresponding  age, the young will have been but little modified, and they will still  resemble each other much more closely than do the adults, just as we  have seen with the breeds of the pigeon.
 We may extend this view to  widely distinct structures and to whole classes.
 The fore-limbs, for  instance, which once served as legs to a remote progenitor, may have  become, through a long course of modification, adapted in one descendant  to act as hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings; but on the  above two principles the fore-limbs will not have been much modified in  the embryos of these several forms; although in each form the fore-limb  will differ greatly in the adult state.
 Whatever influence long  continued use or disuse may have had in modifying the limbs or other  parts of any species, this will chiefly or solely have affected it when  nearly mature, when it was compelled to use its full powers to gain its  own living; and the effects thus produced will have been transmitted to  the offspring at a corresponding nearly mature age.
 Thus the young will  not be modified, or will be modified only in a slight degree, through  the effects of the increased use or disuse of parts.
    With some animals the successive variations may have supervened at a  very early period of life, or the steps may have been inherited at an  earlier age than that at which they first occurred.
 In either of these  cases the young or embryo will closely resemble the mature parent-form,  as we have seen with the short-faced tumbler.
 And this is the rule of  development in certain whole groups, or in certain sub-groups alone,  as with cuttle-fish, land-shells, fresh-water crustaceans, spiders, and  some members of the great class of insects.
 With respect to the final  cause of the young in such groups not passing through any metamorphosis,  we can see that this would follow from the following contingencies:  namely, from the young having to provide at a very early age for their  own wants, and from their following the same habits of life with their  parents; for in this case it would be indispensable for their existence  that they should be modified in the same manner as their parents.
 Again,  with respect to the singular fact that many terrestrial and fresh-water  animals do not undergo any metamorphosis, while marine members of the  same groups pass through various transformations, Fritz Muller has  suggested that the process of slowly modifying and adapting an animal  to live on the land or in fresh water, instead of in the sea, would be  greatly simplified by its not passing through any larval stage; for it  is not probable that places well adapted for both the larval and  mature stages, under such new and greatly changed habits of life, would  commonly be found unoccupied or ill-occupied by other organisms.
 In this  case the gradual acquirement at an earlier and earlier age of the adult  structure would be favoured by natural selection; and all traces of  former metamorphoses would finally be lost.
    If, on the other hand, it profited the young of an animal to follow  habits of life slightly different from those of the parent-form, and  consequently to be constructed on a slightly different plan, or if  it profited a larva already different from its parent to change still  further, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages,  the young or the larvae might be rendered by natural selection more and  more different from their parents to any conceivable extent.
 Differences  in the larva might, also, become correlated with successive stages of  its development; so that the larva, in the first stage, might come to  differ greatly from the larva in the second stage, as is the case with  many animals.
 The adult might also become fitted for sites or habits, in  which organs of locomotion or of the senses, etc.
, would be useless; and  in this case the metamorphosis would be retrograde.
    From the remarks just made we can see how by changes of structure in  the young, in conformity with changed habits of life, together with  inheritance at corresponding ages, animals might come to pass through  stages of development, perfectly distinct from the primordial condition  of their adult progenitors.
 Most of our best authorities are now  convinced that the various larval and pupal stages of insects have thus  been acquired through adaptation, and not through inheritance from some  ancient form.
 The curious case of Sitaris--a beetle which passes through  certain unusual stages of development--will illustrate how this might  occur.
 The first larval form is described by M.
 Fabre, as an active,  minute insect, furnished with six legs, two long antennae, and four  eyes.
 These larvae are hatched in the nests of bees; and when the male  bees emerge from their burrows, in the spring, which they do before  the females, the larvae spring on them, and afterwards crawl on to the  females while paired with the males.
 As soon as the female bee deposits  her eggs on the surface of the honey stored in the cells, the larvae of  the Sitaris leap on the eggs and devour them.
 Afterwards they undergo  a complete change; their eyes disappear; their legs and antennae become  rudimentary, and they feed on honey; so that they now more closely  resemble the ordinary larvae of insects; ultimately they undergo a  further transformation, and finally emerge as the perfect beetle.
 Now,  if an insect, undergoing transformations like those of the Sitaris, were  to become the progenitor of a whole new class of insects, the course of  development of the new class would be widely different from that of  our existing insects; and the first larval stage certainly would not  represent the former condition of any adult and ancient form.
    On the other hand it is highly probable that with many animals the  embryonic or larval stages show us, more or less completely, the  condition of the progenitor of the whole group in its adult state.
 In  the great class of the Crustacea, forms wonderfully distinct from each  other, namely, suctorial parasites, cirripedes, entomostraca, and even  the malacostraca, appear at first as larvae under the nauplius-form; and  as these larvae live and feed in the open sea, and are not adapted for  any peculiar habits of life, and from other reasons assigned by Fritz  Muller, it is probable that at some very remote period an independent  adult animal, resembling the Nauplius, existed, and subsequently  produced, along several divergent lines of descent, the above-named  great Crustacean groups.
 So again, it is probable, from what we know of  the embryos of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, that these animals  are the modified descendants of some ancient progenitor, which was  furnished in its adult state with branchiae, a swim-bladder, four  fin-like limbs, and a long tail, all fitted for an aquatic life.
    As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived,  can be arranged within a few great classes; and as all within each  class have, according to our theory, been connected together by fine  gradations, the best, and, if our collections were nearly perfect, the  only possible arrangement, would be genealogical; descent being the  hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the  term of the Natural System.
 On this view we can understand how it is  that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is  even more important for classification than that of the adult.
 In two or  more groups of animals, however much they may differ from each other  in structure and habits in their adult condition, if they pass through  closely similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they are all  descended from one parent-form, and are therefore closely related.
  Thus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent; but  dissimilarity in embryonic development does not prove discommunity of  descent, for in one of two groups the developmental stages may have been  suppressed, or may have been so greatly modified through adaptation to  new habits of life as to be no longer recognisable.
 Even in groups, in  which the adults have been modified to an extreme degree, community of  origin is often revealed by the structure of the larvae; we have seen,  for instance, that cirripedes, though externally so like shell-fish,  are at once known by their larvae to belong to the great class of  crustaceans.
 As the embryo often shows us more or less plainly the  structure of the less modified and ancient progenitor of the group, we  can see why ancient and extinct forms so often resemble in their  adult state the embryos of existing species of the same class.
 Agassiz  believes this to be a universal law of nature; and we may hope hereafter  to see the law proved true.
 It can, however, be proved true only in  those cases in which the ancient state of the progenitor of the group  has not been wholly obliterated, either by successive variations having  supervened at a very early period of growth, or by such variations  having been inherited at an earlier age than that at which they first  appeared.
 It should also be borne in mind, that the law may be true,  but yet, owing to the geological record not extending far enough back  in time, may remain for a long period, or for ever, incapable of  demonstration.
 The law will not strictly hold good in those cases in  which an ancient form became adapted in its larval state to some special  line of life, and transmitted the same larval state to a whole group  of descendants; for such larval state will not resemble any still more  ancient form in its adult state.
    Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which  are second to none in importance, are explained on the principle of  variations in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor,  having appeared at a not very early period of life, and having been  inherited at a corresponding period.
 Embryology rises greatly in  interest, when we look at the embryo as a picture, more or less  obscured, of the progenitor, either in its adult or larval state, of all  the members of the same great class.
    RUDIMENTARY, ATROPHIED, AND ABORTED ORGANS.
    Organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the plain stamp of  inutility, are extremely common, or even general, throughout nature.
 It  would be impossible to name one of the higher animals in which some  part or other is not in a rudimentary condition.
 In the mammalia, for  instance, the males possess rudimentary mammae; in snakes one lobe of  the lungs is rudimentary; in birds the "bastard-wing" may safely be  considered as a rudimentary digit, and in some species the whole wing is  so far rudimentary that it cannot be used for flight.
 What can be more  curious than the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when grown up  have not a tooth in their heads; or the teeth, which never cut through  the gums, in the upper jaws of unborn calves?    Rudimentary organs plainly declare their origin and meaning in various  ways.
 There are beetles belonging to closely allied species, or even  to the same identical species, which have either full-sized and perfect  wings, or mere rudiments of membrane, which not rarely lie under  wing-covers firmly soldered together; and in these cases it is  impossible to doubt, that the rudiments represent wings.
 Rudimentary  organs sometimes retain their potentiality: this occasionally occurs  with the mammae of male mammals, which have been known to become well  developed and to secrete milk.
 So again in the udders of the genus Bos,  there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats; but the  latter in our domestic cows sometimes become well developed and yield  milk.
 In regard to plants, the petals are sometimes rudimentary, and  sometimes well developed in the individuals of the same species.
 In  certain plants having separated sexes Kolreuter found that by crossing a  species, in which the male flowers included a rudiment of a pistil, with  an hermaphrodite species, having of course a well-developed pistil, the  rudiment in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size; and this  clearly shows that the rudimentary and perfect pistils are essentially  alike in nature.
 An animal may possess various parts in a perfect state,  and yet they may in one sense be rudimentary, for they are useless: thus  the tadpole of the common salamander or water-newt, as Mr. G.
H.
 Lewes  remarks, "has gills, and passes its existence in the water; but the  Salamandra atra, which lives high up among the mountains, brings forth  its young full-formed.
 This animal never lives in the water.
 Yet if  we open a gravid female, we find tadpoles inside her with exquisitely  feathered gills; and when placed in water they swim about like the  tadpoles of the water-newt.
 Obviously this aquatic organisation has no  reference to the future life of the animal, nor has it any adaptation  to its embryonic condition; it has solely reference to ancestral  adaptations, it repeats a phase in the development of its progenitors.
"    An organ, serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly  aborted for one, even the more important purpose, and remain perfectly  efficient for the other.
 Thus, in plants, the office of the pistil is  to allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules within the ovarium.
  The pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in some  Compositae, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated, have  a rudimentary pistil, for it is not crowned with a stigma; but the style  remains well developed and is clothed in the usual manner with hairs,  which serve to brush the pollen out of the surrounding and conjoined  anthers.
 Again, an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose,  and be used for a distinct one: in certain fishes the swim-bladder seems  to be rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy, but has  become converted into a nascent breathing organ or lung.
 Many similar  instances could be given.
    Useful organs, however little they may be developed, unless we have  reason to suppose that they were formerly more highly developed, ought  not to be considered as rudimentary.
 They may be in a nascent condition,  and in progress towards further development.
 Rudimentary organs, on  the other hand, are either quite useless, such as teeth which never cut  through the gums, or almost useless, such as the wings of an ostrich,  which serve merely as sails.
 As organs in this condition would formerly,  when still less developed, have been of even less use than at present,  they cannot formerly have been produced through variation and  natural selection, which acts solely by the preservation of useful  modifications.
 They have been partially retained by the power of  inheritance, and relate to a former state of things.
 It is, however,  often difficult to distinguish between rudimentary and nascent organs;  for we can judge only by analogy whether a part is capable of further  development, in which case alone it deserves to be called nascent.
  Organs in this condition will always be somewhat rare; for beings thus  provided will commonly have been supplanted by their successors with the  same organ in a more perfect state, and consequently will have become  long ago extinct.
 The wing of the penguin is of high service, acting as  a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state of the wing: not  that I believe this to be the case; it is more probably a reduced organ,  modified for a new function: the wing of the Apteryx, on the other hand,  is quite useless, and is truly rudimentary.
 Owen considers the simple  filamentary limbs of the Lepidosiren as the "beginnings of organs  which attain full functional development in higher vertebrates;" but,  according to the view lately advocated by Dr.
 Gunther, they are probably  remnants, consisting of the persistent axis of a fin, with the lateral  rays or branches aborted.
 The mammary glands of the Ornithorhynchus may  be considered, in comparison with the udders of a cow, as in a nascent  condition.
 The ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes, which have ceased  to give attachment to the ova and are feebly developed, are nascent  branchiae.
    Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very  liable to vary in the degree of their development and in other respects.
  In closely allied species, also, the extent to which the same organ  has been reduced occasionally differs much.
 This latter fact is well  exemplified in the state of the wings of female moths belonging to  the same family.
 Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this  implies, that in certain animals or plants, parts are entirely absent  which analogy would lead us to expect to find in them, and which  are occasionally found in monstrous individuals.
 Thus in most of  the Scrophulariaceae the fifth stamen is utterly aborted; yet we may  conclude that a fifth stamen once existed, for a rudiment of it is found  in many species of the family, and this rudiment occasionally becomes  perfectly developed, as may sometimes be seen in the common snap-dragon.
  In tracing the homologies of any part in different members of the same  class, nothing is more common, or, in order fully to understand the  relations of the parts, more useful than the discovery of rudiments.
  This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of the leg bones of the  horse, ox, and rhinoceros.
    It is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the  upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo,  but afterwards wholly disappear.
 It is also, I believe, a universal  rule, that a rudimentary part is of greater size in the embryo  relatively to the adjoining parts, than in the adult; so that the organ  at this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in  any degree rudimentary.
 Hence rudimentary organs in the adult are often  said to have retained their embryonic condition.
    I have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs.
  In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment; for  the same reasoning power which tells us that most parts and organs are  exquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness  that these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect and useless.
 In  works on natural history, rudimentary organs are generally said to have  been created "for the sake of symmetry," or in order "to complete the  scheme of nature.
" But this is not an explanation, merely a restatement  of the fact.
 Nor is it consistent with itself: thus the boa-constrictor  has rudiments of hind limbs and of a pelvis, and if it be said that  these bones have been retained "to complete the scheme of nature," why,  as Professor Weismann asks, have they not been retained by other snakes,  which do not possess even a vestige of these same bones? What would be  thought of an astronomer who maintained that the satellites revolve in  elliptic courses round their planets "for the sake of symmetry," because  the planets thus revolve round the sun? An eminent physiologist accounts  for the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to  excrete matter in excess, or matter injurious to the system; but can we  suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil in  male flowers, and which is formed of mere cellular tissue, can thus act?  Can we suppose that rudimentary teeth, which are subsequently absorbed,  are beneficial to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by removing  matter so precious as phosphate of lime? When a man's fingers have been  amputated, imperfect nails have been known to appear on the stumps, and  I could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails are developed in  order to excrete horny matter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin  of the manatee have been developed for this same purpose.
    On the view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary  organs is comparatively simple; and we can understand to a large extent  the laws governing their imperfect development.
 We have plenty of cases  of rudimentary organs in our domestic productions, as the stump of a  tail in tailless breeds, the vestige of an ear in earless breeds of  sheep--the reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of  cattle, more especially, according to Youatt, in young animals--and the  state of the whole flower in the cauliflower.
 We often see rudiments of  various parts in monsters; but I doubt whether any of these cases throw  light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further  than by showing that rudiments can be produced; for the balance of  evidence clearly indicates that species under nature do not undergo  great and abrupt changes.
 But we learn from the study of our domestic  productions that the disuse of parts leads to their reduced size; and  that the result is inherited.
    It appears probable that disuse has been the main agent in rendering  organs rudimentary.
 It would at first lead by slow steps to the more  and more complete reduction of a part, until at last it became  rudimentary--as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark  caverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which  have seldom been forced by beasts of prey to take flight, and have  ultimately lost the power of flying.
 Again, an organ, useful under  certain conditions, might become injurious under others, as with the  wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in this case  natural selection will have aided in reducing the organ, until it was  rendered harmless and rudimentary.
    Any change in structure and function, which can be effected by small  stages, is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ  rendered, through changed habits of life, useless or injurious for one  purpose, might be modified and used for another purpose.
 An organ  might, also, be retained for one alone of its former functions.
 Organs,  originally formed by the aid of natural selection, when rendered useless  may well be variable, for their variations can no longer be checked by  natural selection.
 All this agrees well with what we see under nature.
  Moreover, at whatever period of life either disuse or selection reduces  an organ, and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity  and to exert its full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at  corresponding ages will tend to reproduce the organ in its reduced state  at the same mature age, but will seldom affect it in the embryo.
 Thus  we can understand the greater size of rudimentary organs in the embryo  relatively to the adjoining parts, and their lesser relative size in the  adult.
 If, for instance, the digit of an adult animal was used less and  less during many generations, owing to some change of habits, or if an  organ or gland was less and less functionally exercised, we may infer  that it would become reduced in size in the adult descendants of this  animal, but would retain nearly its original standard of development in  the embryo.
    There remains, however, this difficulty.
 After an organ has ceased being  used, and has become in consequence much reduced, how can it be still  further reduced in size until the merest vestige is left; and how can it  be finally quite obliterated? It is scarcely possible that disuse can go  on producing any further effect after the organ has once been rendered  functionless.
 Some additional explanation is here requisite which I  cannot give.
 If, for instance, it could be proved that every part of the  organisation tends to vary in a greater degree towards diminution than  toward augmentation of size, then we should be able to understand how an  organ which has become useless would be rendered, independently of the  effects of disuse, rudimentary and would at last be wholly suppressed;  for the variations towards diminished size would no longer be checked by  natural selection.
 The principle of the economy of growth, explained in  a former chapter, by which the materials forming any part, if not useful  to the possessor, are saved as far as is possible, will perhaps come  into play in rendering a useless part rudimentary.
 But this principle  will almost necessarily be confined to the earlier stages of the process  of reduction; for we cannot suppose that a minute papilla, for instance,  representing in a male flower the pistil of the female flower, and  formed merely of cellular tissue, could be further reduced or absorbed  for the sake of economising nutriment.
    Finally, as rudimentary organs, by whatever steps they may have been  degraded into their present useless condition, are the record of a  former state of things, and have been retained solely through the  power of inheritance--we can understand, on the genealogical view of  classification, how it is that systematists, in placing organisms in  their proper places in the natural system, have often found rudimentary  parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high  physiological importance.
 Rudimentary organs may be compared with the  letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in  the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue for its derivation.
 On the  view of descent with modification, we may conclude that the existence  of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite  aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly  do on the old doctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated in  accordance with the views here explained.
    SUMMARY.
    In this  have attempted to show that the arrangement of all  organic beings throughout all time in groups under groups--that the  nature of the relationships by which all living and extinct organisms  are united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities  into a few grand classes--the rules followed and the difficulties  encountered by naturalists in their classifications--the value set upon  characters, if constant and prevalent, whether of high or of the  most trifling importance, or, as with rudimentary organs of no  importance--the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive  characters, and characters of true affinity; and other such rules--all  naturally follow if we admit the common parentage of allied forms,  together with their modification through variation and natural  selection, with the contingencies of extinction and divergence of  character.
 In considering this view of classification, it should be  borne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used  in ranking together the sexes, ages, dimorphic forms, and acknowledged  varieties of the same species, however much they may differ from each  other in structure.
 If we extend the use of this element of descent--the  one certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings--we shall  understand what is meant by the Natural System: it is genealogical in  its attempted arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked  by the terms, varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes.
    On this same view of descent with modification, most of the great facts  in Morphology become intelligible--whether we look to the same pattern  displayed by the different species of the same class in their homologous  organs, to whatever purpose applied, or to the serial and lateral  homologies in each individual animal and plant.
    On the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily  or generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being  inherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the leading facts  in embryology; namely, the close resemblance in the individual embryo  of the parts which are homologous, and which when matured become  widely different in structure and function; and the resemblance of the  homologous parts or organs in allied though distinct species, though  fitted in the adult state for habits as different as is possible.
 Larvae  are active embryos, which have become specially modified in a greater  or less degree in relation to their habits of life, with their  modifications inherited at a corresponding early age.
 On these same  principles, and bearing in mind that when organs are reduced in size,  either from disuse or through natural selection, it will generally be at  that period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants, and  bearing in mind how strong is the force of inheritance--the occurrence  of rudimentary organs might even have been anticipated.
 The importance  of embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification  is intelligible, on the view that a natural arrangement must be  genealogical.
    Finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in  this chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable  species, genera and families, with which this world is peopled, are all  descended, each within its own class or group, from common parents, and  have all been modified in the course of descent, that I should without  hesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other facts  or arguments.
          .
 RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.
     Recapitulation of the objections to the theory of Natural   Selection--Recapitulation of the general and special circumstances   in its favour--Causes of the general belief in the immutability   of species--How far the theory of Natural Selection may be   extended--Effects of its adoption on the study of Natural   History--Concluding remarks.
      As this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the  reader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.
    That many and serious objections may be advanced against the theory of  descent with modification through variation and natural selection, I do  not deny.
 I have endeavoured to give to them their full force.
 Nothing  at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex  organs and instincts have been perfected, not by means superior  to, though analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of  innumerable slight variations, each good for the individual possessor.
  Nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination  insuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following  propositions, namely, that all parts of the organisation and instincts  offer, at least individual differences--that there is a struggle for  existence leading to the preservation of profitable deviations of  structure or instinct--and, lastly, that gradations in the state of  perfection of each organ may have existed, each good of its kind.
 The  truth of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed.
    It is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what  gradations many structures have been perfected, more especially among  broken and failing groups of organic beings, which have suffered much  extinction; but we see so many strange gradations in nature, that we  ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or  any whole structure, could not have arrived at its present state by  many graduated steps.
 There are, it must be admitted, cases of special  difficulty opposed to the theory of natural selection; and one of the  most curious of these is the existence in the same community of two  or three defined castes of workers or sterile female ants; but I have  attempted to show how these difficulties can be mastered.
    With respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first  crossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal  fertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the  recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the ninth chapter, which  seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special  endowment than is the incapacity of two distinct kinds of trees to be  grafted together; but that it is incidental on differences confined to  the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species.
 We see the truth  of this conclusion in the vast difference in the results of crossing the  same two species reciprocally--that is, when one species is first used  as the father and then as the mother.
 Analogy from the consideration of  dimorphic and trimorphic plants clearly leads to the same conclusion,  for when the forms are illegitimately united, they yield few or no seed,  and their offspring are more or less sterile; and these forms belong  to the same undoubted species, and differ from each other in no respect  except in their reproductive organs and functions.
    Although the fertility of varieties when intercrossed, and of their  mongrel offspring, has been asserted by so many authors to be universal,  this cannot be considered as quite correct after the facts given on the  high authority of Gartner and Kolreuter.
 Most of the varieties which  have been experimented on have been produced under domestication; and as  domestication (I do not mean mere confinement) almost certainly tends  to eliminate that sterility which, judging from analogy, would have  affected the parent-species if intercrossed, we ought not to expect  that domestication would likewise induce sterility in their modified  descendants when crossed.
 This elimination of sterility apparently  follows from the same cause which allows our domestic animals to breed  freely under diversified circumstances; and this again apparently  follows from their having been gradually accustomed to frequent changes  in their conditions of life.
    A double and parallel series of facts seems to throw much light on the  sterility of species, when first crossed, and of their hybrid offspring.
  On the one side, there is good reason to believe that slight changes in  the conditions of life give vigour and fertility to all organic beings.
  We know also that a cross between the distinct individuals of the same  variety, and between distinct varieties, increases the number of their  offspring, and certainly gives to them increased size and vigour.
 This  is chiefly owing to the forms which are crossed having been exposed  to somewhat different conditions of life; for I have ascertained by a  labourious series of experiments that if all the individuals of the same  variety be subjected during several generations to the same conditions,  the good derived from crossing is often much diminished or wholly  disappears.
 This is one side of the case.
 On the other side, we know  that species which have long been exposed to nearly uniform conditions,  when they are subjected under confinement to new and greatly changed  conditions, either perish, or if they survive, are rendered sterile,  though retaining perfect health.
 This does not occur, or only in a very  slight degree, with our domesticated productions, which have long been  exposed to fluctuating conditions.
 Hence when we find that hybrids  produced by a cross between two distinct species are few in number,  owing to their perishing soon after conception or at a very early age,  or if surviving that they are rendered more or less sterile, it seems  highly probable that this result is due to their having been in fact  subjected to a great change in their conditions of life, from being  compounded of two distinct organisations.
 He who will explain in a  definite manner why, for instance, an elephant or a fox will not breed  under confinement in its native country, whilst the domestic pig or dog  will breed freely under the most diversified conditions, will at the  same time be able to give a definite answer to the question why two  distinct species, when crossed, as well as their hybrid offspring,  are generally rendered more or less sterile, while two domesticated  varieties when crossed and their mongrel offspring are perfectly  fertile.
    Turning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on  the theory of descent with modification are serious enough.
 All the  individuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus,  or even higher group, are descended from common parents; and therefore,  in however distant and isolated parts of the world they may now be  found, they must in the course of successive generations have travelled  from some one point to all the others.
 We are often wholly unable even  to conjecture how this could have been effected.
 Yet, as we have reason  to believe that some species have retained the same specific form for  very long periods of time, immensely long as measured by years, too much  stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same  species; for during very long periods there will always have been a good  chance for wide migration by many means.
 A broken or interrupted range  may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in the  intermediate regions.
 It cannot be denied that we are as yet  very ignorant as to the full extent of the various climatical and  geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern  periods; and such changes will often have facilitated migration.
 As an  example, I have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of  the Glacial period on the distribution of the same and of allied species  throughout the world.
 We are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many  occasional means of transport.
 With respect to distinct species of the  same genus, inhabiting distant and isolated regions, as the process of  modification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration  will have been possible during a very long period; and consequently the  difficulty of the wide diffusion of the species of the same genus is in  some degree lessened.
    As according to the theory of natural selection an interminable number  of intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the  species in each group by gradations as fine as our existing varieties,  it may be asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us?  Why are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable  chaos? With respect to existing forms, we should remember that we  have no right to expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover DIRECTLY  connecting links between them, but only between each and some extinct  and supplanted form.
 Even on a wide area, which has during a long period  remained continuous, and of which the climatic and other conditions of  life change insensibly in proceeding from a district occupied by one  species into another district occupied by a closely allied species, we  have no just right to expect often to find intermediate varieties in  the intermediate zones.
 For we have reason to believe that only a few  species of a genus ever undergo change; the other species becoming  utterly extinct and leaving no modified progeny.
 Of the species which do  change, only a few within the same country change at the same time;  and all modifications are slowly effected.
 I have also shown that  the intermediate varieties which probably at first existed in the  intermediate zones, would be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms  on either hand; for the latter, from existing in greater numbers,  would generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the  intermediate varieties, which existed in lesser numbers; so that  the intermediate varieties would, in the long run, be supplanted and  exterminated.
    On this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting  links, between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at  each successive period between the extinct and still older species, why  is not every geological formation charged with such links? Why does  not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the  gradation and mutation of the forms of life? Although geological  research has undoubtedly revealed the former existence of many links,  bringing numerous forms of life much closer together, it does not yield  the infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species  required on the theory, and this is the most obvious of the many  objections which may be urged against it.
 Why, again, do whole groups  of allied species appear, though this appearance is often false, to have  come in suddenly on the successive geological stages? Although we  now know that organic beings appeared on this globe, at a period  incalculably remote, long before the lowest bed of the Cambrian system  was deposited, why do we not find beneath this system great piles  of strata stored with the remains of the progenitors of the Cambrian  fossils? For on the theory, such strata must somewhere have been  deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs of the world's  history.
    I can answer these questions and objections only on the supposition  that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists  believe.
 The number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as  nothing compared with the countless generations of countless species  which have certainly existed.
 The parent form of any two or more species  would not be in all its characters directly intermediate between  its modified offspring, any more than the rock-pigeon is directly  intermediate in crop and tail between its descendants, the pouter and  fantail pigeons.
 We should not be able to recognise a species as the  parent of another and modified species, if we were to examine the two  ever so closely, unless we possessed most of the intermediate links;  and owing to the imperfection of the geological record, we have no just  right to expect to find so many links.
 If two or three, or even more  linking forms were discovered, they would simply be ranked by many  naturalists as so many new species, more especially if found in  different geological substages, let their differences be ever so slight.
  Numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably  varieties; but who will pretend that in future ages so many fossil links  will be discovered, that naturalists will be able to decide whether  or not these doubtful forms ought to be called varieties? Only a small  portion of the world has been geologically explored.
 Only organic beings  of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least  in any great number.
 Many species when once formed never undergo any  further change but become extinct without leaving modified descendants;  and the periods during which species have undergone modification, though  long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with  the periods during which they retained the same form.
 It is the dominant  and widely ranging species which vary most frequently and vary most, and  varieties are often at first local--both causes rendering the discovery  of intermediate links in any one formation less likely.
 Local  varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are  considerably modified and improved; and when they have spread, and are  discovered in a geological formation, they appear as if suddenly created  there, and will be simply classed as new species.
 Most formations have  been intermittent in their accumulation; and their duration has probably  been shorter than the average duration of specific forms.
 Successive  formations are in most cases separated from each other by blank  intervals of time of great length, for fossiliferous formations  thick enough to resist future degradation can, as a general rule, be  accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed  of the sea.
 During the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary  level the record will generally be blank.
 During these latter periods  there will probably be more variability in the forms of life; during  periods of subsidence, more extinction.
    With respect to the absence of strata rich in fossils beneath the  Cambrian formation, I can recur only to the hypothesis given in the  tenth chapter; namely, that though our continents and oceans have  endured for an enormous period in nearly their present relative  positions, we have no reason to assume that this has always been the  case; consequently formations much older than any now known may lie  buried beneath the great oceans.
 With respect to the lapse of time not  having been sufficient since our planet was consolidated for the assumed  amount of organic change, and this objection, as urged by Sir William  Thompson, is probably one of the gravest as yet advanced, I can only  say, firstly, that we do not know at what rate species change, as  measured by years, and secondly, that many philosophers are not as yet  willing to admit that we know enough of the constitution of the universe  and of the interior of our globe to speculate with safety on its past  duration.
    That the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that it is  imperfect to the degree required by our theory, few will be inclined  to admit.
 If we look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly  declares that species have all changed; and they have changed in the  manner required by the theory, for they have changed slowly and in  a graduated manner.
 We clearly see this in the fossil remains from  consecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to  each other than are the fossils from widely separated formations.
    Such is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties  which may justly be urged against the theory; and I have now briefly  recapitulated the answers and explanations which, as far as I can see,  may be given.
 I have felt these difficulties far too heavily during many  years to doubt their weight.
 But it deserves especial notice that  the more important objections relate to questions on which we are  confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are.
 We do not know  all the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the  most perfect organs; it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied  means of Distribution during the long lapse of years, or that we  know how imperfect is the Geological Record.
 Serious as these several  objections are, in my judgment they are by no means sufficient to  overthrow the theory of descent with subsequent modification.
    Now let us turn to the other side of the argument.
 Under domestication  we see much variability, caused, or at least excited, by changed  conditions of life; but often in so obscure a manner, that we are  tempted to consider the variations as spontaneous.
 Variability is  governed by many complex laws, by correlated growth, compensation,  the increased use and disuse of parts, and the definite action of the  surrounding conditions.
 There is much difficulty in ascertaining how  largely our domestic productions have been modified; but we may safely  infer that the amount has been large, and that modifications can be  inherited for long periods.
 As long as the conditions of life remain the  same, we have reason to believe that a modification, which has already  been inherited for many generations, may continue to be inherited for  an almost infinite number of generations.
 On the other hand we have  evidence that variability, when it has once come into play, does not  cease under domestication for a very long period; nor do we know that  it ever ceases, for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our  oldest domesticated productions.
    Variability is not actually caused by man; he only unintentionally  exposes organic beings to new conditions of life and then nature acts on  the organisation and causes it to vary.
 But man can and does select  the variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulates them in any  desired manner.
 He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or  pleasure.
 He may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by  preserving the individuals most useful or pleasing to him without any  intention of altering the breed.
 It is certain that he can largely  influence the character of a breed by selecting, in each successive  generation, individual differences so slight as to be inappreciable  except by an educated eye.
 This unconscious process of selection has  been the great agency in the formation of the most distinct and useful  domestic breeds.
 That many breeds produced by man have to a large extent  the character of natural species, is shown by the inextricable doubts  whether many of them are varieties or aboriginally distinct species.
    There is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently  under domestication should not have acted under nature.
 In the survival  of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly recurrent  Struggle for Existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of  Selection.
 The struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high  geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings.
  This high rate of increase is proved by calculation--by the rapid  increase of many animals and plants during a succession of peculiar  seasons, and when naturalised in new countries.
 More individuals are  born than can possibly survive.
 A grain in the balance may determine  which individuals shall live and which shall die--which variety or  species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally  become extinct.
 As the individuals of the same species come in all  respects into the closest competition with each other, the struggle will  generally be most severe between them; it will be almost equally severe  between the varieties of the same species, and next in severity between  the species of the same genus.
 On the other hand the struggle will often  be severe between beings remote in the scale of nature.
 The slightest  advantage in certain individuals, at any age or during any season, over  those with which they come into competition, or better adaptation in  however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions, will, in  the long run, turn the balance.
    With animals having separated sexes, there will be in most cases a  struggle between the males for the possession of the females.
 The most  vigorous males, or those which have most successfully struggled with  their conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny.
 But success  will often depend on the males having special weapons or means of  defence or charms; and a slight advantage will lead to victory.
    As geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical  changes, we might have expected to find that organic beings have varied  under nature, in the same way as they have varied under domestication.
  And if there has been any variability under nature, it would be an  unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play.
 It has  often been asserted, but the assertion is incapable of proof, that the  amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited quantity.
 Man,  though acting on external characters alone and often capriciously,  can produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere  individual differences in his domestic productions; and every one  admits that species present individual differences.
 But, besides such  differences, all naturalists admit that natural varieties exist,  which are considered sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record  in systematic works.
 No one has drawn any clear distinction between  individual differences and slight varieties; or between more plainly  marked varieties and subspecies and species.
 On separate continents, and  on different parts of the same continent, when divided by barriers of  any kind, and on outlying islands, what a multitude of forms exist,  which some experienced naturalists rank as varieties, others as  geographical races or sub species, and others as distinct, though  closely allied species!    If, then, animals and plants do vary, let it be ever so slightly or  slowly, why should not variations or individual differences, which are  in any way beneficial, be preserved and accumulated through natural  selection, or the survival of the fittest? If man can by patience select  variations useful to him, why, under changing and complex conditions  of life, should not variations useful to nature's living products often  arise, and be preserved or selected? What limit can be put to this  power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole  constitution, structure, and habits of each creature, favouring the good  and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in slowly and  beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life.
  The theory of natural selection, even if we look no further than  this, seems to be in the highest degree probable.
 I have already  recapitulated, as fairly as I could, the opposed difficulties and  objections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour  of the theory.
    On the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent  varieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can  see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species,  commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation,  and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary  laws.
 On this same view we can understand how it is that in a region  where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now  flourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where  the manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a  general rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if  varieties be incipient species.
 Moreover, the species of the larger  genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient  species, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for  they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the  species of smaller genera.
 The closely allied species also of a larger  genera apparently have restricted ranges, and in their affinities they  are clustered in little groups round other species--in both respects  resembling varieties.
 These are strange relations on the view that each  species was independently created, but are intelligible if each existed  first as a variety.
    As each species tends by its geometrical rate of reproduction to  increase inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of  each species will be enabled to increase by as much as they become more  diversified in habits and structure, so as to be able to seize on many  and widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a  constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent  offspring of any one species.
 Hence during a long-continued course of  modification, the slight differences characteristic of varieties of  the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences  characteristic of the species of the same genus.
 New and improved  varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less  improved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a  large extent defined and distinct objects.
 Dominant species belonging  to the larger groups within each class tend to give birth to new and  dominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger,  and at the same time more divergent in character.
 But as all groups  cannot thus go on increasing in size, for the world would not hold them,  the more dominant groups beat the less dominant.
 This tendency in the  large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character,  together with the inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains  the arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to  groups, all within a few great classes, which has prevailed throughout  all time.
 This grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings under  what is called the Natural System, is utterly inexplicable on the theory  of creation.
    As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive,  favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modifications;  it can act only by short and slow steps.
 Hence, the canon of "Natura  non facit saltum," which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends  to confirm, is on this theory intelligible.
 We can see why throughout  nature the same general end is gained by an almost infinite diversity of  means, for every peculiarity when once acquired is long inherited, and  structures already modified in many different ways have to be adapted  for the same general purpose.
 We can, in short, see why nature is  prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation.
 But why this should  be a law of nature if each species has been independently created no man  can explain.
    Many other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory.
 How  strange it is that a bird, under the form of a woodpecker, should prey  on insects on the ground; that upland geese, which rarely or never swim,  would possess webbed feet; that a thrush-like bird should dive and feed  on sub-aquatic insects; and that a petrel should have the habits and  structure fitting it for the life of an auk! and so in endless other  cases.
 But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in  number, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying  descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature,  these facts cease to be strange, or might even have been anticipated.
    We can to a certain extent understand how it is that there is so much  beauty throughout nature; for this may be largely attributed to the  agency of selection.
 That beauty, according to our sense of it, is not  universal, must be admitted by every one who will look at some venomous  snakes, at some fishes, and at certain hideous bats with a distorted  resemblance to the human face.
 Sexual selection has given the most  brilliant colours, elegant patterns, and other ornaments to the males,  and sometimes to both sexes of many birds, butterflies and other  animals.
 With birds it has often rendered the voice of the male musical  to the female, as well as to our ears.
 Flowers and fruit have been  rendered conspicuous by brilliant colours in contrast with the green  foliage, in order that the flowers may be easily seen, visited and  fertilised by insects, and the seeds disseminated by birds.
 How it comes  that certain colours, sounds and forms should give pleasure to man and  the lower animals, that is, how the sense of beauty in its simplest form  was first acquired, we do not know any more than how certain odours and  flavours were first rendered agreeable.
    As natural selection acts by competition, it adapts and improves the  inhabitants of each country only in relation to their co-inhabitants;  so that we need feel no surprise at the species of any one country,  although on the ordinary view supposed to have been created and  specially adapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the  naturalised productions from another land.
 Nor ought we to marvel if all  the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely  perfect; as in the case even of the human eye; or if some of them be  abhorrent to our ideas of fitness.
 We need not marvel at the sting of  the bee, when used against the enemy, causing the bee's own death; at  drones being produced in such great numbers for one single act, and  being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing  waste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the  queen-bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidae feeding within  the living bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases.
 The wonder,  indeed, is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the  want of absolute perfection have not been detected.
    The complex and little known laws governing the production of varieties  are the same, as far as we can judge, with the laws which have governed  the production of distinct species.
 In both cases physical conditions  seem to have produced some direct and definite effect, but how much  we cannot say.
 Thus, when varieties enter any new station, they  occasionally assume some of the characters proper to the species of that  station.
 With both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have  produced a considerable effect; for it is impossible to resist this  conclusion when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which  has wings incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the  domestic duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucu-tucu, which is  occasionally blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually  blind and have their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the  blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of America and Europe.
 With  varieties and species, correlated variation seems to have played an  important part, so that when one part has been modified other parts have  been necessarily modified.
 With both varieties and species, reversions  to long-lost characters occasionally occur.
 How inexplicable on the  theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the  shoulders and legs of the several species of the horse-genus and of  their hybrids! How simply is this fact explained if we believe that  these species are all descended from a striped progenitor, in the same  manner as the several domestic breeds of the pigeon are descended from  the blue and barred rock-pigeon!    On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,  why should specific characters, or those by which the species of the  same genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic  characters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour  of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if  the other species possess differently coloured flowers, than if all  possessed the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked  varieties, of which the characters have become in a high degree  permanent, we can understand this fact; for they have already varied  since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters,  by which they have come to be specifically distinct from each other;  therefore these same characters would be more likely again to vary than  the generic characters which have been inherited without change for an  immense period.
 It is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part  developed in a very unusual manner in one species alone of a genus,  and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to that  species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on our view, this  part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common  progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and  therefore we might expect the part generally to be still variable.
 But  a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the wing of a  bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part  be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited  for a very long period; for in this case it will have been rendered  constant by long-continued natural selection.
    Glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater  difficulty than do corporeal structures on the theory of the natural  selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications.
 We  can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing  different animals of the same class with their several instincts.
 I have  attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on  the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee.
 Habit no doubt  often comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not  indispensable, as we see in the case of neuter insects, which leave no  progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit.
 On the view of  all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent,  and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that  allied species, when placed under widely different conditions of life,  yet follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrushes of tropical and  temperate South America, for instance, line their nests with mud  like our British species.
 On the view of instincts having been slowly  acquired through natural selection, we need not marvel at some instincts  being not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing  other animals to suffer.
    If species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once  see why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws  in their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents--in being  absorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such  points--as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties.
 This  similarity would be a strange fact, if species had been independently  created and varieties had been produced through secondary laws.
    If we admit that the geological record is imperfect to an extreme  degree, then the facts, which the record does give, strongly support the  theory of descent with modification.
 New species have come on the stage  slowly and at successive intervals; and the amount of change after  equal intervals of time, is widely different in different groups.
 The  extinction of species and of whole groups of species, which has played  so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world, almost  inevitably follows from the principle of natural selection; for old  forms are supplanted by new and improved forms.
 Neither single species  nor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation  is once broken.
 The gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the slow  modification of their descendants, causes the forms of life, after  long intervals of time, to appear as if they had changed simultaneously  throughout the world.
 The fact of the fossil remains of each formation  being in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils  in the formations above and below, is simply explained by their  intermediate position in the chain of descent.
 The grand fact that all  extinct beings can be classed with all recent beings, naturally follows  from the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents.
  As species have generally diverged in character during their long course  of descent and modification, we can understand why it is that the more  ancient forms, or early progenitors of each group, so often occupy a  position in some degree intermediate between existing groups.
 Recent  forms are generally looked upon as being, on the whole, higher in the  scale of organisation than ancient forms; and they must be higher, in  so far as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and  less improved forms in the struggle for life; they have also generally  had their organs more specialised for different functions.
 This fact is  perfectly compatible with numerous beings still retaining simple and but  little improved structures, fitted for simple conditions of life; it is  likewise compatible with some forms having retrograded in organisation,  by having become at each stage of descent better fitted for new and  degraded habits of life.
 Lastly, the wonderful law of the long endurance  of allied forms on the same continent--of marsupials in Australia, of  edentata in America, and other such cases--is intelligible, for within  the same country the existing and the extinct will be closely allied by  descent.
    Looking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been  during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world  to another, owing to former climatical and geographical changes and  to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can  understand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the  great leading facts in Distribution.
 We can see why there should be so  striking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout  space, and in their geological succession throughout time; for in both  cases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation,  and the means of modification have been the same.
 We see the full  meaning of the wonderful fact, which has struck every traveller, namely,  that on the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, under  heat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of  the inhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they  are the descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists.
 On  this same principle of former migration, combined in most cases with  modification, we can understand, by the aid of the Glacial period, the  identity of some few plants, and the close alliance of many others, on  the most distant mountains, and in the northern and southern temperate  zones; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the  sea in the northern and southern temperate latitudes, though separated  by the whole intertropical ocean.
 Although two countries may present  physical conditions as closely similar as the same species ever require,  we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different,  if they have been for a long period completely sundered from each other;  for as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of  all relations, and as the two countries will have received colonists at  various periods and in different proportions, from some other country  or from each other, the course of modification in the two areas will  inevitably have been different.
    On this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we see why  oceanic islands are inhabited by only few species, but of these, why  many are peculiar or endemic forms.
 We clearly see why species belonging  to those groups of animals which cannot cross wide spaces of the ocean,  as frogs and terrestrial mammals, do not inhabit oceanic islands; and  why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats, animals which  can traverse the ocean, are often found on islands far distant from any  continent.
 Such cases as the presence of peculiar species of bats on  oceanic islands and the absence of all other terrestrial mammals,  are facts utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of  creation.
    The existence of closely allied representative species in any two areas,  implies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the same  parent-forms formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably  find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some  identical species are still common to both.
 Wherever many closely allied  yet distinct species occur, doubtful forms and varieties belonging to  the same groups likewise occur.
 It is a rule of high generality that the  inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest  source whence immigrants might have been derived.
 We see this in the  striking relation of nearly all the plants and animals of the Galapagos  Archipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the other American islands, to  the plants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland; and of  those of the Cape de Verde Archipelago, and of the other African islands  to the African mainland.
 It must be admitted that these facts receive no  explanation on the theory of creation.
    The fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings can  be arranged within a few great classes, in groups subordinate to groups,  and with the extinct groups often falling in between the recent  groups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its  contingencies of extinction and divergence of character.
 On these same  principles we see how it is that the mutual affinities of the forms  within each class are so complex and circuitous.
 We see why certain  characters are far more serviceable than others for classification; why  adaptive characters, though of paramount importance to the beings, are  of hardly any importance in classification; why characters derived from  rudimentary parts, though of no service to the beings, are often of high  classificatory value; and why embryological characters are often the  most valuable of all.
 The real affinities of all organic beings, in  contradistinction to their adaptive resemblances, are due to inheritance  or community of descent.
 The Natural System is a genealogical  arrangement, with the acquired grades of difference, marked by the  terms, varieties, species, genera, families, etc.
; and we have to  discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters, whatever  they may be, and of however slight vital importance.
    The similar framework of bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat,  fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse--the same number of vertebrae  forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant--and innumerable  other such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent  with slow and slight successive modifications.
 The similarity of pattern  in the wing and in the leg of a bat, though used for such different  purpose--in the jaws and legs of a crab--in the petals, stamens, and  pistils of a flower, is likewise, to a large extent, intelligible on  the view of the gradual modification of parts or organs, which were  aboriginally alike in an early progenitor in each of these classes.
  On the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an  early age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of  life, we clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and  fishes should be so closely similar, and so unlike the adult forms.
 We  may cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird  having branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those of  a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water by the aid of  well-developed branchiae.
    Disuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often have reduced  organs when rendered useless under changed habits or conditions of life;  and we can understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs.
  But disuse and selection will generally act on each creature, when it  has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for  existence, and will thus have little power on an organ during early  life; hence the organ will not be reduced or rendered rudimentary at  this early age.
 The calf, for instance, has inherited teeth, which never  cut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early progenitor having  well-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the teeth in the mature  animal were formerly reduced by disuse owing to the tongue and palate,  or lips, having become excellently fitted through natural selection to  browse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the teeth have been left  unaffected, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages  have been inherited from a remote period to the present day.
 On the  view of each organism with all its separate parts having been specially  created, how utterly inexplicable is it that organs bearing the plain  stamp of inutility, such as the teeth in the embryonic calf or the  shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of many beetles, should  so frequently occur.
 Nature may be said to have taken pains to  reveal her scheme of modification, by means of rudimentary organs,  of embryological and homologous structures, but we are too blind to  understand her meaning.
    I have now recapitulated the facts and considerations which have  thoroughly convinced me that species have been modified, during a long  course of descent.
 This has been effected chiefly through the natural  selection of numerous successive, slight, favourable variations; aided  in an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse  of parts; and in an unimportant manner, that is, in relation to adaptive  structures, whether past or present, by the direct action of external  conditions, and by variations which seem to us in our ignorance to arise  spontaneously.
 It appears that I formerly underrated the frequency  and value of these latter forms of variation, as leading to permanent  modifications of structure independently of natural selection.
 But as my  conclusions have lately been much misrepresented, and it has been stated  that I attribute the modification of species exclusively to natural  selection, I may be permitted to remark that in the first edition  of this work, and subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous  position--namely, at the close of the Introduction--the following words:  "I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the  exclusive means of modification.
" This has been of no avail.
 Great is  the power of steady misrepresentation; but the history of science shows  that fortunately this power does not long endure.
    It can hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain, in so  satisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection, the  several large classes of facts above specified.
 It has recently been  objected that this is an unsafe method of arguing; but it is a method  used in judging of the common events of life, and has often been used  by the greatest natural philosophers.
 The undulatory theory of light has  thus been arrived at; and the belief in the revolution of the earth on  its own axis was until lately supported by hardly any direct evidence.
  It is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light on the far  higher problem of the essence or origin of life.
 Who can explain what  is the essence of the attraction of gravity? No one now objects  to following out the results consequent on this unknown element of  attraction; notwithstanding that Leibnitz formerly accused Newton of  introducing "occult qualities and miracles into philosophy.
"    I see no good reasons why the views given in this volume should shock  the religious feelings of any one.
 It is satisfactory, as showing how  transient such impressions are, to remember that the greatest discovery  ever made by man, namely, the law of the attraction of gravity, was also  attacked by Leibnitz, "as subversive of natural, and inferentially of  revealed, religion.
" A celebrated author and divine has written to  me that "he has gradually learned to see that it is just as noble a  conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms  capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe  that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by  the action of His laws.
"    Why, it may be asked, until recently did nearly all the most eminent  living naturalists and geologists disbelieve in the mutability of  species? It cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature  are subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the amount of  variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear  distinction has been, or can be, drawn between species and well-marked  varieties.
 It cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are  invariably sterile and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility  is a special endowment and sign of creation.
 The belief that species  were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history  of the world was thought to be of short duration; and now that we have  acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to assume,  without proof, that the geological record is so perfect that it would  have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species, if they had  undergone mutation.
    But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one  species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are  always slow in admitting any great changes of which we do not see the  steps.
 The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists,  when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been  formed, and great valleys excavated, by the agencies which we still see  at work.
 The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of  even a million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of  many slight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of  generations.
    Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this  volume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince  experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of  facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view  directly opposite to mine.
 It is so easy to hide our ignorance under  such expressions as the "plan of creation," "unity of design," etc.
, and  to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact.
 Any  one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained  difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts  will certainly reject the theory.
 A few naturalists, endowed with  much flexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt the  immutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look  with confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will  be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality.
 Whoever  is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by  conscientiously expressing his conviction; for thus only can the load of  prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.
    Several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that  a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but  that other species are real, that is, have been independently created.
  This seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at.
 They admit that  a multitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were  special creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of  naturalists, and which consequently have all the external characteristic  features of true species--they admit that these have been produced by  variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and slightly  different forms.
 Nevertheless, they do not pretend that they can define,  or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which are  those produced by secondary laws.
 They admit variation as a vera causa  in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning  any distinction in the two cases.
 The day will come when this will  be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived  opinion.
 These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of  creation than at an ordinary birth.
 But do they really believe that at  innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have  been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe  that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were  produced? Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants  created as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals,  were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the  mother's womb? Undoubtedly some of these same questions cannot be  answered by those who believe in the appearance or creation of only a  few forms of life or of some one form alone.
 It has been maintained  by several authors that it is as easy to believe in the creation of a  million beings as of one; but Maupertuis' philosophical axiom "of least  action" leads the mind more willingly to admit the smaller number; and  certainly we ought not to believe that innumerable beings within each  great class have been created with plain, but deceptive, marks of  descent from a single parent.
    As a record of a former state of things, I have retained in the  foregoing paragraphs, and elsewhere, several sentences which imply that  naturalists believe in the separate creation of each species; and I have  been much censured for having thus expressed myself.
 But undoubtedly  this was the general belief when the first edition of the present work  appeared.
 I formerly spoke to very many naturalists on the subject of  evolution, and never once met with any sympathetic agreement.
 It is  probable that some did then believe in evolution, but they were either  silent or expressed themselves so ambiguously that it was not easy to  understand their meaning.
 Now, things are wholly changed, and almost  every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution.
 There are,  however, some who still think that species have suddenly given birth,  through quite unexplained means, to new and totally different forms.
  But, as I have attempted to show, weighty evidence can be opposed to the  admission of great and abrupt modifications.
 Under a scientific point of  view, and as leading to further investigation, but little advantage  is gained by believing that new forms are suddenly developed in an  inexplicable manner from old and widely different forms, over the old  belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth.
    It may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of  species.
 The question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct  the forms are which we consider, by so much the arguments in favour of  community of descent become fewer in number and less in force.
 But some  arguments of the greatest weight extend very far.
 All the members of  whole classes are connected together by a chain of affinities, and all  can be classed on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups.
  Fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between  existing orders.
    Organs in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor  had the organ in a fully developed condition, and this in some  cases implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants.
  Throughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same  pattern, and at a very early age the embryos closely resemble each  other.
 Therefore I cannot doubt that the theory of descent with  modification embraces all the members of the same great class or  kingdom.
 I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or  five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number.
    Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all  animals and plants are descended from some one prototype.
 But analogy  may be a deceitful guide.
 Nevertheless all living things have much in  common, in their chemical composition, their cellular structure, their  laws of growth, and their liability to injurious influences.
 We see  this even in so trifling a fact as that the same poison often similarly  affects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly  produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree.
 With all  organic beings, excepting perhaps some of the very lowest, sexual  reproduction seems to be essentially similar.
 With all, as far as is at  present known, the germinal vesicle is the same; so that all  organisms start from a common origin.
 If we look even to the two main  divisions--namely, to the animal and vegetable kingdoms--certain  low forms are so far intermediate in character that naturalists have  disputed to which kingdom they should be referred.
 As Professor Asa Gray  has remarked, "the spores and other reproductive bodies of many of the  lower algae may claim to have first a characteristically animal, and  then an unequivocally vegetable existence.
" Therefore, on the principle  of natural selection with divergence of character, it does not seem  incredible that, from some such low and intermediate form, both animals  and plants may have been developed; and, if we admit this, we must  likewise admit that all the organic beings which have ever lived on this  earth may be descended from some one primordial form.
 But this inference  is chiefly grounded on analogy, and it is immaterial whether or not it  be accepted.
 No doubt it is possible, as Mr. G.
H.
 Lewes has urged, that  at the first commencement of life many different forms were evolved;  but if so, we may conclude that only a very few have left modified  descendants.
 For, as I have recently remarked in regard to the members  of each great kingdom, such as the Vertebrata, Articulata, etc.
, we have  distinct evidence in their embryological, homologous, and rudimentary  structures, that within each kingdom all the members are descended from  a single progenitor.
    When the views advanced by me in this volume, and by Mr. Wallace or when  analogous views on the origin of species are generally admitted, we can  dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural  history.
 Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at  present; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt  whether this or that form be a true species.
 This, I feel sure and I  speak after experience, will be no slight relief.
 The endless disputes  whether or not some fifty species of British brambles are good species  will cease.
 Systematists will have only to decide (not that this will be  easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from  other forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable, whether the  differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name.
 This  latter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is  at present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms,  if not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most  naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species.
    Hereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction  between species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are  known, or believed to be connected at the present day by intermediate  gradations, whereas species were formerly thus connected.
 Hence, without  rejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate  gradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more  carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between  them.
 It is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be  merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names; and  in this case scientific and common language will come into accordance.
  In short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those  naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial  combinations made for convenience.
 This may not be a cheering prospect;  but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered  and undiscoverable essence of the term species.
    The other and more general departments of natural history will rise  greatly in interest.
 The terms used by naturalists, of affinity,  relationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive  characters, rudimentary and aborted organs, etc.
, will cease to be  metaphorical and will have a plain signification.
 When we no longer look  at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as something wholly  beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature  as one which has had a long history; when we contemplate every complex  structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each  useful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical  invention is the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason,  and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each  organic being, how far more interesting--I speak from experience--does  the study of natural history become!    A grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the  causes and laws of variation, on correlation, on the effects of use and  disuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth.
  The study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value.
 A new  variety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting  subject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of  already recorded species.
 Our classifications will come to be, as far as  they can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be  called the plan of creation.
 The rules for classifying will no doubt  become simpler when we have a definite object in view.
 We possess no  pedigree or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace  the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by  characters of any kind which have long been inherited.
 Rudimentary  organs will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost  structures.
 Species and groups of species which are called aberrant, and  which may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in forming a  picture of the ancient forms of life.
 Embryology will often reveal to us  the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of each great  class.
    When we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species,  and all the closely allied species of most genera, have, within a not  very remote period descended from one parent, and have migrated  from some one birth-place; and when we better know the many means  of migration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will  continue to throw, on former changes of climate and of the level of the  land, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner  the former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world.
 Even at  present, by comparing the differences between the inhabitants of the  sea on the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature of the various  inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of  immigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.
    The noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection  of the record.
 The crust of the earth, with its embedded remains, must  not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection  made at hazard and at rare intervals.
 The accumulation of each great  fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an  unusual occurrence of favourable circumstances, and the blank intervals  between the successive stages as having been of vast duration.
 But  we shall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these  intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic  forms.
 We must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly  contemporaneous two formations, which do not include many identical  species, by the general succession of the forms of life.
 As species are  produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes,  and not by miraculous acts of creation; and as the most important of all  causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered  and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual  relation of organism to organism--the improvement of one organism  entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it follows,  that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive  formations probably serves as a fair measure of the relative, though not  actual lapse of time.
 A number of species, however, keeping in a body  might remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within the same period,  several of these species, by migrating into new countries and coming  into competition with foreign associates, might become modified; so  that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of  time.
    In the future I see open fields for far more important researches.
  Psychology will be securely based on the foundation already well laid  by Mr. Herbert Spencer, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental  power and capacity by gradation.
 Much light will be thrown on the origin  of man and his history.
    Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view  that each species has been independently created.
 To my mind it accords  better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator,  that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants  of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those  determining the birth and death of the individual.
 When I view all  beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some  few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system  was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled.
 Judging from the  past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its  unaltered likeness to a distinct futurity.
 And of the species now living  very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity;  for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the  greater number of species in each genus, and all the species in many  genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct.
 We  can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretell that it  will be the common and widely spread species, belonging to the larger  and dominant groups within each class, which will ultimately prevail and  procreate new and dominant species.
 As all the living forms of life are  the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Cambrian  epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation  has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the  whole world.
 Hence, we may look with some confidence to a secure future  of great length.
 And as natural selection works solely by and for the  good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to  progress towards perfection.
    It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many  plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various  insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,  and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different  from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner,  have all been produced by laws acting around us.
 These laws, taken in  the largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is  almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct  action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of  Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence  to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the  Extinction of less improved forms.
 Thus, from the war of nature, from  famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of  conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly  follows.
 There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several  powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms  or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according  to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms  most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.
      GLOSSARY OF THE PRINCIPAL SCIENTIFIC TERMS USED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME.

  Jean Ingelow.
         There are three things in this world which deserve no       quarter--Hypocrisy, Pharisaism, and Tyranny.
  F.
 Robertson    People who have been brought up in the country, or in small places where  every neighbor is known by sight, are apt to think that life in a large  town must lack many of the interests which they have learned to find in  their more limited communities.
 In a somewhat bewildered way, they gaze  at the shifting crowd of strange faces, and wonder whether it would be  possible to feel completely at home where all the surroundings of life  seem ever changing and unfamiliar.
    But those who have lived long in one quarter of London, or of any other  large town, know that there are in reality almost as many links between  the actors of the town life-drama as between those of the country  life-drama.
    Silent recognitions pass between passengers who meet day after day in  the same morning or evening train, on the way to or from work; the faces  of omnibus conductors grow familiar; we learn to know perfectly well on  what day of the week and at what hour the well-known organ-grinder will  make his appearance, and in what street we shall meet the city clerk or  the care-worn little daily governess on their way to office or school.
  It so happened that Brian Osmond, a young doctor who had not been very  long settled in the Bloomsbury regions, had an engagement which took  him every afternoon down Gower Street, and here many faces had grown  familiar to him.
 He invariably met the same sallow-faced postman, the  same nasal-voiced milkman, the same pompous-looking man with the bushy  whiskers and the shiny black bag, on his way home from the city.
 But the  only passenger in whom he took any interest was a certain bright-faced  little girl whom he generally met just before the Montague Place  crossing.
 He always called her his "little girl," though she was by no  means little in the ordinary acceptation of the word, being at least  sixteen, and rather tall for her years.
 But there was a sort of  freshness and naivete and youthfulness about her which made him use  that adjective.
 She usually carried a pile of books in a strap, so he  conjectured that she must be coming from school, and, ever since he had  first seen her, she had worn the same rough blue serge dress, and the  same quaint little fur hat.
 In other details, however, he could never  tell in the least how he should find her.
 She seemed to have a mood for  every day.
 Sometimes she would be in a great hurry and would almost run  past him; sometimes she would saunter along in the most unconventional  way, glancing from time to time at a book or a paper; sometimes her  eager face would look absolutely bewitching in its brightness; sometimes  scarcely less bewitching in a consuming anxiety which seemed unnatural  in one so young.
    One rainy afternoon in November, Brian was as usual making his way down  Gower Street, his umbrella held low to shelter him from the driving rain  which seemed to come in all directions.
 The milkman's shrill voice was  still far in the distance, the man of letters was still at work upon  knockers some way off, it was not yet time for his little girl to make  her appearance, and he was not even thinking of her, when suddenly his  umbrella was nearly knocked out of his hand by coming violently into  collision with another umbrella.
 Brought thus to a sudden stand, he  looked to see who it was who had charged him with such violence, and  found himself face to face with his unknown friend.
 He had never been  quite so close to her before.
 Her quaint face had always fascinated him,  but on nearer view he thought it the loveliest face he had ever seen--it  took his heart by storm.
    It was framed in soft, silky masses of dusky auburn hair which hung over  the broad, white forehead, but at the back was scarcely longer than a  boy's.
 The features, though not regular, were delicate and piquant; the  usual faint rose-flush on the cheeks deepened now to carnation, perhaps  because of the slight contretemps, perhaps because of some deeper  emotion--Brian fancied the latter, for the clear, golden-brown eyes that  were lifted to his seemed bright either with indignation or with unshed  tears.
 Today it was clear that the mood was not a happy one.
    "I am very sorry," she said, looking up at him, and speaking in a low,  musical voice, but with the unembarrassed frankness of a child.
 "I  really wasn't thinking or looking; it was very careless of me.
"    Brian of course took all the blame to himself, and apologized profusely;  but though he would have given much to detain her, if only a moment, she  gave him no opportunity, but with a slight inclination passed rapidly  on.
 He stood quite still, watching her till she was out of sight, aware  of a sudden change in his life.
 He was a busy hard-working man, not at  all given to dreams, and it was no dream that he was in now.
 He knew  perfectly well that he had met his ideal, had spoken to her and she to  him; that somehow in a single moment a new world had opened out to him.
  He had fallen in love.
    The trifling occurrence had made no great impression on the "little  girl" herself.
 She was rather vexed with herself for the carelessness,  but a much deeper trouble was filling her heart.
 She soon forgot the  passing interruption and the brown-bearded man with the pleasant gray  eyes who had apologized for what was quite her fault.
 Something had  gone wrong that day, as Brian had surmised; the eyes grew brighter, the  carnation flush deepened as she hurried along, the delicate lips  closed with a curiously hard expression, the hands were clasped with  unnecessary tightness round the umbrella.
    She passed up Guilford Square, but did not turn into any of the old  decayed houses; her home was far less imposing.
 At the corner of the  square there is a narrow opening which leads into a sort of blind alley  paved with grim flagstones.
 Here, facing a high blank wall, are four  or five very dreary houses.
 She entered one of these, put down her wet  umbrella in the shabby little hall, and opened the door of a barely  furnished room, the walls of which were, however, lined with books.
  Beside the fire was the one really comfortable piece of furniture in the  room, an Ikeley couch, and upon it lay a very wan-looking invalid, who  glanced up with a smile of welcome.
 "Why, Erica, you are home early  today.
 How is that?"    "Oh, I don't know," said Erica, tossing down her books in a way which  showed her mother that she was troubled about something.
 "I suppose I  tore along at a good rate, and there was no temptation to stay at the  High School.
"    "Come and tell me about it," said the mother, gently, "what has gone  wrong, little one?"    "Everything!" exclaimed Erica, vehemently.
 "Everything always does go  wrong with us and always will, I suppose.
 I wish you had never sent me  to school, mother; I wish I need never see the place again!"    "But till today you enjoyed it so much.
"    "Yes, the classes and the being with Gertrude.
 But that will never be  the same again.
 It's just this, mother, I'm never to speak to Gertrude  again--to have noting more to do with her.
"    "Who said so? And Why?"    "Why? Because I'm myself," said Erica, with a bitter little laugh.
 "How  I can help it, nobody seems to think.
 But Gertrude's father has come  back from Africa, and was horrified to learn that we were friends, made  her promise never to speak to me again, and made her write this note  about it.
 Look!" and she took a crumpled envelope from her pocket.
    The mother read the note in silence, and an expression of pain came over  her face.
 Erica, who was very impetuous, snatched it away from her when  she saw that look of sadness.
    "Don't read the horrid thing!" she exclaimed, crushing it up in her  hand.
 "There, we will burn it!" and she threw it into the fire with a  vehemence which somehow relieved her.
    "You shouldn't have done that," said her mother.
 "Your father will be  sure to want to see it.
"    "No, no, no," cried Erica, passionately.
 "He must not know; you must not  tell him, mother.
"    "Dear child, have you not learned that it is impossible to keep anything  from him? He will find out directly that something is wrong.
"    "It will grieve him so; he must not hear it," said Erica.
 "He cares so  much for what hurts us.
 Oh! Why are people so hard and cruel? Why do  they treat us like lepers? It isn't all because of losing Gertrude;  I could bear that if there were some real reason--if she went away  or died.
 But there's no reason! It's all prejudice and bigotry and  injustice; it's that which makes it sting so.
"    Erica was not at all given to tears, but there was now a sort of choking  in her throat, and a sort of dimness in her eyes which made her rather  hurriedly settle down on the floor in her own particular nook beside her  mother's couch, where her face could not be seen.
 There was a silence.
  Presently the mother spoke, stroking back the wavy, auburn hair with her  thin white hand.
    "For a long time I have dreaded this for you, Erica.
 I was afraid you  didn't realize the sort of position the world will give you.
 Till lately  you have seen scarcely any but our own people, but it can hardly be,  darling, that you can go on much longer without coming into contact with  others; and then, more and more, you must realize that you are cut off  from much that other girls may enjoy.
"    "Why?" questioned Erica.
 "Why can't they be friendly? Why must they cut  us off from everything?"    "It does seem unjust; but you must remember that we belong to an  unpopular minority.
"    "But if I belonged to the larger party, I would at least be just to  the smaller," said Erica.
 "How can they expect us to think their system  beautiful when the very first thing they show us is hatred and meanness.
  Oh! If I belonged to the other side I would show them how different it  might be.
"    "I believe you would," said the mother, smiling a little at the idea,  and at the vehemence of the speaker.
 "But, as it is, Erica, I am afraid  you must school yourself to endure.
 After all, I fancy you will be glad  to share so soon in your father's vexations.
"    "Yes," said Erica, pushing back the hair from her forehead, and giving  herself a kind of mental shaking.
 "I am glad of that.
 After all, they  can't spoil the best part of our lives! I shall go into the garden to  get rid of my bad temper; it doesn't rain now.
"    She struggled to her feet, picked up the little fur hat which had fallen  off, kissed her mother, and went out of the room.
    The "garden" was Erica's favorite resort, her own particular property.
  It was about fifteen feet square, and no one but a Londoner would have  bestowed on it so dignified a name.
 But Erica, who was of an inventive  turn, had contrived to make the most of the little patch of ground, had  induced ivy to grow on the ugly brick walls, and with infinite care and  satisfaction had nursed a few flowers and shrubs into tolerably healthy  though smutty life.
 In one of the corners, Tom Craigie, her favorite  cousin, had put up a rough wooden bench for her, and here she read and  dreamed as contentedly as if her "garden ground" had been fairy-land.
  Here, too, she invariably came when anything had gone wrong, when the  endless troubles about money which had weighed upon her all her  life became a little less bearable than usual, or when some act of  discourtesy or harshness to her father had roused in her a tingling,  burning sense of indignation.
    Erica was not one of those people who take life easily; things went very  deeply with her.
 In spite of her brightness and vivacity, in spite of  her readiness to see the ludicrous in everything, and her singularly  quick perceptions, she was also very keenly alive to other and graver  impressions.
    Her anger had passed, but still, as she paced round and round her small  domain, her heart was very heavy.
 Life seemed perplexing to her; but her  mother had somehow struck the right key-note when she had spoken of the  vexations which might be shared.
 There was something inspiriting in  that thought, certainly, for Erica worshipped her father.
 By degrees the  trouble and indignation died away, and a very sweet look stole over the  grave little face.
    A smutty sparrow came and peered down at her from the ivy-colored wall,  and chirped and twittered in quite a friendly way, perhaps recognizing  the scatter of its daily bread.
    "After all," though Erica, "with ourselves and the animals, we might let  the rest of the world treat us as they please.
 I am glad they can't turn  the animals and birds against us! That would be worse than anything.
"    Then, suddenly turning from the abstract to the practical, she took out  of her pocket a shabby little sealskin purse.
    "Still sixpence of my prize money over," she remarked to herself; "I'll  go and buy some scones for tea.
 Father likes them.
"    Erica's father was a Scotchman, and, though so-called scones were to be  had at most shops, there was only one place where she could buy scones  which she considered worthy the name, and that was at the Scotch baker's  in Southampton Row.
 She hurried along the wet pavements, glad that the  rain was over, for as soon as her purchase was completed she made up  her mind to indulge for a few minutes in what had lately become a  very frequent treat, namely a pause before a certain tempting store of  second-hand books.
 She had never had money enough to buy anything except  the necessary school books, and, being a great lover of poetry, she  always seized with avidity on anything that was to be found outside the  book shop.
 Sometimes she would carry away a verse of Swinburne, which  would ring in her ears for days and days; sometimes she would read as  much as two or three pages of Shelley.
 No one had every interrupted her,  and a certain sense of impropriety and daring was rather stimulating  than otherwise.
 It always brought to her mind a saying in the proverbs  of Solomon, "Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is  pleasant.
"    For three successive days she had found to her great delight  Longfellow's "Hiawatha.
" The strange meter, the musical Indian names,  the delightfully described animals, all served to make the poem  wonderfully fascinating to her.
 She thought a page or two of "Hiawatha"  would greatly sweeten her somewhat bitter world this afternoon, and  with her bag of scones in one hand and the book in the other she read  on happily, quite unconscious that three pair of eyes were watching her  from within the shop.
    The wrinkled old man who was the presiding genius of the place had two  customers, a tall, gray-bearded clergyman with bright, kindly eyes, and  his son, the same Brian Osmond whom Erica had charged with her umbrella  in Gower Street.
    "An outside customer for you," remarked Charles Osmond, the clergyman,  glancing at the shop keeper.
 Then to his son, "What a picture she  makes!"    Brian looked up hastily from some medical books which he had been  turning over.
    "Why that's my little Gower Street friend," he exclaimed, the words  being somehow surprised out of him, though he would fain have recalled  them the next minute.
    "I don't interrupt her," said the shop owner.
 "Her father has done a  great deal of business with me, and the little lady has a fancy for  poetry, and don't get much of it in her life, I'll be bound.
"    "Why, who is she?" asked Charles Osmond, who was on very friendly terms  with the old book collector.
    "She's the daughter of Luke Raeburn," was the reply, "and whatever folks  may say, I know that Mr. Raeburn leads a hard enough life.
"    Brian turned away from the speakers, a sickening sense of dismay at his  heart.
 His ideal was the daughter of Luke Raeburn! And Luke Raeburn was  an atheist leader!    For a few minutes he lost consciousness of time and place, though always  seeing in a sort of dark mist Erica's lovely face bending over her book.
  The shop keeper's casual remark had been a fearful blow to him; yet,  as he came to himself again, his heart went out more and more to the  beautiful girl who had been brought up in what seemed to him so barren  a creed.
 His dream of love, which had been bright enough only an hour  before, was suddenly shadowed by an unthought of pain, but presently  began to shine with a new and altogether different luster.
 He began to  hear again what was passing between his father and the shop keeper.
    "There's a sight more good in him than folks think.
 However wrong his  views, he believes them right, and is ready to suffer for 'em, too.
  Bless me, that's odd, to be sure! There is Mr. Raeburn, on the other  side of the Row! Fine-looking man, isn't he?"    Brian, looking up eagerly, fancied he must be mistaken for the only  passenger in sight was a very tall man of remarkably benign aspect,  middle-aged, yet venerable--or perhaps better described by the word  "devotional-looking," pervaded too by a certain majesty of calmness  which seemed scarcely suited to his character of public agitator.
  The clean-shaven and somewhat rugged face was unmistakably that of a  Scotchman, the thick waves of tawny hair overshadowing the wide brow,  and the clear golden-brown eyes showed Brian at once that this could be  no other than the father of his ideal.
    In the meantime, Raeburn, having caught sight of his daughter, slowly  crossed the road, and coming noiselessly up to her, suddenly took hold  of the book she was reading, and with laughter in his eyes, said, in a  peremptory voice:    "Five shillings to pay, if you please, miss!"    Erica, who had been absorbed in the poem, looked up in dismay; then  seeing who had spoken, she began to laugh.
    "What a horrible fright you gave me, father! But do look at this, it's  the loveliest thing in the world.
 I've just got to the 'very strong man  Kwasind.
' I think he's a little like you!"    Raeburn, though no very great lover of poetry, took the book and read a  few lines.
    "Long they lived in peace together, Spake with naked hearts together,  Pondering much and much contriving How the tribes of men might prosper.
"    "Good! That will do very well for you and me, little one.
 I'm ready to  be your Kwasind.
 What's the price of the thing? Four and sixpence! Too  much for a luxury.
 It must wait till our ship comes in.
"    He put down the book, and they moved on together, but had not gone many  paces before they were stopped by a most miserable-looking beggar child.
  Brian standing now outside the shop, saw and heard all that passed.
    Raeburn was evidently investigating the case, Erica, a little impatient  of the interruption, was remonstrating.
    "I thought you never gave to beggars, and I am sure that harrowing story  is made up.
"    "Very likely," replied the father, "but the hunger is real, and I know  well enough what hunger is.
 What have you here?" he added, indicating  the paper bag which Erica held.
    "Scones," she said, unwillingly.
    "That will do," he said, taking them from her and giving them to the  child.
 "He is too young to be anything but the victim of another's  laziness.
 There! Sit down and eat them while you can.
"    The child sat down on the doorstep with the bag of scones clasped in  both hands, but he continued to gaze after his benefactor till he  had passed out of sight, and there was a strange look of surprise and  gratification in his eyes.
 That was a man who knew! Many people had,  after hard begging, thrown him pence, many had warned him off harshly,  but this man had looked straight into his eyes, and had at once stopped  and questioned him, had singled out the one true statement from a mass  of lies, and had given him--not a stale loaf with the top cut off, a  suspicious sort of charity which always angered the waif--but his own  food, bought for his own consumption.
 Most wonderful of all, too,  this man knew what it was to be hungry, and had even the insight and  shrewdness to be aware that the waif's best chance of eating the scones  at all was to eat them then and there.
 For the first time a feeling of  reverence and admiration was kindled in the child's heart; he would have  done a great deal for his unknown friend.
    Raeburn and Erica had meanwhile walked on in the direction of Guilford  Square.
    "I had bought them for you," said Erica, reproachfully.
    "And I ruthlessly gave them away," said Raeburn, smiling.
 "That was hard  lines; I though they were only household stock.
 But after all it comes  to the same thing in the end, or better.
 You have given them to me by  giving them to the child.
 Never mind, 'Little son Eric!'"    This was his pet name for her, and it meant a great deal to them.
 She  was his only child, and it had at first been a great disappointment to  every one that she was not a boy.
 But Raeburn had long ago ceased to  regret this, and the nickname referred more to Erica's capability of  being both son and daughter to him, able to help him in his work and at  the same time to brighten his home.
 Erica was very proud of her name,  for she had been called after her father's greatest friend, Eric  Haeberlein, a celebrated republican, who once during a long exile had  taken refuge in London.
 His views were in some respects more extreme  than Raeburn's, but in private life he was the gentlest and most  fascinating of men, and had quite won the heart of his little namesake.
    As Mrs. Raeburn had surmised, Erica's father had at once seen that  something had gone wrong that day.
 The all-observing eyes, which had  noticed the hungry look in the beggar child's face, noticed at once that  his own child had been troubled.
    "Something has vexed you," he said.
 "What is the matter, Erica?"    "I had rather not tell you, father, it isn't anything much," said Erica,  casting down her eyes as if all at once the paving stones had become  absorbingly interesting.
    "I fancy I know already," said Raeburn.
 "It is about your friend at the  High School, is it not.
 I thought so.
 This afternoon I had a letter from  her father.
"    "What does he say? May I see it?" asked Erica.
    "I tore it up," said Raeburn, "I thought you would ask to see it, and  the thing was really so abominably insolent that I didn't want you to.
  How did you hear about it?"    "Gertrude wrote me a note," said Erica.
    "At her father's dictation, no doubt," said Raeburn; "I should know his  style directly, let me see it.
"    "I thought it was a pity to vex you, so I burned it," said Erica.
    Then, unable to help being amused at their efforts to save each other,  they both laughed, though the subject was rather a sore one.
    "It is the old story," said Raeburn.
 "Life only, as Pope Innocent III  benevolently remarked, 'is to be left to the children of misbelievers,  and that only as an act of mercy.
' You must make up your mind to bear  the social stigma, child.
 Do you see the moral of this?"    "No," said Erica, with something between a smile and a sigh.
    "The moral of it is that you must be content with your own people," said  Raeburn.
 "There is this one good point about persecution--it does draw  us all nearer together, really strengthens us in a hundred ways.
 So,  little one, you must forswear school friends, and be content with your  'very strong man Kwasind,' and we will         "'Live in peace together Speak with naked hearts together.
'    By the bye, it is rather doubtful if Tom will be able to come to the  lecture tonight; do you think you can take notes for me instead?"    This was in reality the most delicate piece of tact and consideration,  for it was, of course, Erica's delight and pride to help her father.

 From Effect to Cause         Only the acrid spirit of the times, Corroded this true       steel.
 Longfellow.
         Not Thine the bigot's partial plea,       Not Thine the zealot's ban;       Thou well canst spare a love of Thee       Which ends in hate of man.
       Whittier.
    Luke Raeburn was the son of a Scotch clergyman of the Episcopal Church.
  His history, though familiar to his own followers and to them more  powerfully convincing than many arguments against modern Christianity,  was not generally known.
 The orthodox were apt to content themselves  with shuddering at the mention of his name; very few troubled themselves  to think or inquire how this man had been driven into atheism.
 Had they  done so they might, perhaps, have treated him more considerately, at any  rate they must have learned that the much-disliked prophet of atheism  was the most disinterested of men, one who had the courage of his  opinions, a man of fearless honesty.
    Raeburn had lost his mother very early; his father, a well-to-do man,  had held for many years a small living in the west of Scotland.
 He was  rather a clever man, but one-sided and bigoted; cold-hearted, too, and  caring very little for his children.
 Of Luke, however, he was, in his  peculiar fashion, very proud, for at an early age the boy showed signs  of genius.
 The father was no great worker; though shrewd and clever,  he had no ambition, and was quietly content to live out his life in the  retired little parsonage where, with no parish to trouble him, and a  small and unexacting congregation on Sundays, he could do pretty much as  he pleased.
 But for his son he was ambitious.
 Ever since his sixteenth  year--when, at a public meeting the boy had, to the astonishment  of every one, suddenly sprung to his feet and contradicted a false  statement made by a great landowner as to the condition of the cottages  on his estate--the father had foreseen future triumphs for his son.
 For  the speech, though unpremeditated, was marvelously clever, and there was  a power in it not to be accounted for by a certain ring of indignation;  it was the speech of a future orator.
    Then, too, Luke had by this time shown signs of religious zeal, a zeal  which his father, though far from attempting to copy, could not but  admire.
 His Sunday services over, he relapsed into the comfortable,  easy-going life of a country gentleman for the rest of the week; but  his son was indefatigable, and, though little more than a boy himself,  gathered round him the roughest lads of the village, and by his  eloquence, and a certain peculiar personal fascination which he retained  all his life, absolutely forced them to listen to him.
 The father  augured great things for him, and invariably prophesied that he would  "live to see him a bishop yet.
"    It was a settled thing that he should take Holy Orders, and for some  time Raeburn was only too happy to carry out his father's plans.
 In his  very first term at Cambridge, however, he began to feel doubts, and,  becoming convinced that he could never again accept the doctrines in  which he had been educated, he told his father that he must give up all  thought of taking Orders.
    Now, unfortunately, Mr. Raeburn was the very last man to understand  or sympathize with any phase of life through which he had not himself  passed.
 He had never been troubled with religious doubts; skepticism  seemed to him monstrous and unnatural.
 He met the confession, which  his son had made in pain and diffidence, with a most deplorable want of  tact.
 In answer to the perplexing questions which were put to him, he  merely replied testily that Luke had been overworking himself, and that  he had no business to trouble his head with matters which were beyond  him, and would fain have dismissed the whole affair at once.
    "But," urged the son, "how is it possible for me to turn my back on  these matters when I am preparing to teach them?"    "Nonsense," replied the father, angrily.
 "Have not I taught all my life,  preached twice a Sunday these thirty years without perplexing myself  with your questionings? Be off to your shooting, and your golf, and let  me have no more of this morbid fuss.
"    No more was said; but Luke Raeburn, with his doubts and questions shut  thus into himself, drifted rapidly from skepticism to the most positive  form of unbelief.
 When he next came home for the long vacation, his  father was at length awakened to the fact that the son, upon whom all  his ambition was set, was hopelessly lost to the Church; and with this  consciousness a most bitter sense of disappointment rose in his heart.
  His pride, the only side of fatherhood which he possessed, was deeply  wounded, and his dreams of honorable distinction were laid low.
 His  wrath was great.
 Luke found the home made almost unbearable to him.
 His  college career was of course at an end, for his father would not hear  of providing him with the necessary funds now that he had actually  confessed his atheism.
 He was hardly allowed to speak to his sisters,  every request for money to start him in some profession met with a sharp  refusal, and matters were becoming so desperate that he would probably  have left the place of his own accord before long, had not Mr. Raeburn  himself put an end to a state of things which had grown insufferable.
    With some lurking hope, perhaps, of convincing his son, he resolved  upon trying a course of argument.
 To do him justice he really tried to  prepare himself for it, dragged down volumes of dusty divines, and got  up with much pains Paley's "watch" argument.
 There was some honesty,  even perhaps a very little love, in his mistaken endeavors; but he did  not recognize that while he himself was unforgiving, unloving, harsh,  and self-indulgent, all his arguments for Christianity were of necessity  null and void.
 He argued for the existence of a perfectly loving, good  God, all the while treating his son with injustice and tyranny.
 Of  course there could be only one result from a debate between the  two.
 Luke Raeburn with his honesty, his great abilities, his gift of  reasoning, above all his thorough earnestness, had the best of it.
    To be beaten in argument was naturally the one thing which such a man as  Mr. Raeburn could not forgive.
 He might in time have learned to tolerate  a difference of opinion, he would beyond a doubt have forgiven almost  any of the failings that he could understand, would have paid his son's  college debts without a murmur, would have overlooked anything connected  with what he considered the necessary process of "sowing his wild oats.
"  But that the fellow should presume to think out the greatest problems in  the world, should set up his judgment against Paley's, and worst of  all should actually and palpably beat HIM in argument--this was an  unpardonable offense.
    A stormy scene ensued.
 The father, in ungovernable fury, heaped upon the  son every abusive epithet he could think of.
 Luke Raeburn spoke not a  word; he was strong and self-controlled; moreover, he knew that he had  had the best of the argument.
 He was human, however, and his heart was  wrung by his father's bitterness.
 Standing there on that summer day,  in the study of the Scotch parsonage, the man's future was sealed.
 He  suffered there the loss of all things, but at the very time there sprung  up in him an enthusiasm for the cause of free thought, a passionate,  burning zeal for the opinions for which he suffered, which never left  him, but served as the great moving impulse of his whole subsequent  life.
    "I tell you, you are not fit to be in a gentleman's house," thundered  the father.
 "A rank atheist, a lying infidel! It is against nature that  you should call a parsonage your home.
"    "It is not particularly home-like," said the son, bitterly.
 "I can leave  it when you please.
"    "Can!" exclaimed the father, in a fury, "you WILL leave it, sir, and  this very day too! I disown you from this time.
 I'll have no atheist for  my son! Change your views or leave the house at once.
"    Perhaps he expected his son to make some compromise; if so he showed  what a very slight knowledge he had of his character.
 Luke Raeburn had  certainly not been prepared for such extreme harshness, but with  the pain and grief and indignation there rose in his heart a mighty  resoluteness.
 With a face as hard and rugged as the granite rocks  without, he wished his father goodbye, and obeyed his orders.
    Then had followed such a struggle with the world as few men would have  gone through with.
 Cut off from all friends and relations by his avowal  of atheism, and baffled again and again in seeking to earn his living,  he had more than once been on the very brink of starvation.
 By sheer  force of will he had won his way, had risen above adverse circumstances,  had fought down obstacles, and conquered opposing powers.
 Before long  he had made fresh friends and gained many followers, for there was an  extraordinary magnetism about the man which almost compelled those who  were brought into contact with him to reverence him.
    It was a curious history.
 First there had been that time of grievous  doubt; then he had been thrown upon the world friendless and penniless,  with the beliefs and hopes hitherto most sacred to him dead, and in  their place an aching blank.
 He had suffered much.
 Treated on all sides  with harshness and injustice, it was indeed wonderful that he had not  developed into a mere hater, a passionate down-puller.
 But there was in  his character a nobility which would not allow him to rest at this  low level.
 The bitter hostility and injustice which he encountered  did indeed warp his mind, and every year of controversy made it more  impossible for him to take an unprejudiced view of Christ's teaching;  but nevertheless he could not remain a mere destroyer.
    In that time of blankness, when he had lost all faith in God, when he  had been robbed of friendship and family love, he had seized desperately  on the one thing left him--the love of humanity.
 To him atheism meant  not only the assertion--"The word God is a word without meaning, it  conveys nothing to my understanding.
" He added to this barren confession  of an intellectual state a singularly high code of duty.
 Such a code as  could only have emanated from one about whom there lingered what Carlyle  has termed a great after-shine of Christianity.
 He held that the only  happiness worth having was that which came to a man while engaged in  promoting the general good.
 That the whole duty of man was to devote  himself to the service of others.
 And he lived his creed.
    Like other people, he had his faults, but he was always ready to spend  and he spent for what he considered the good of others, while every  act of injustice called forth his unsparing rebuke, and every oppressed  person or cause was sure to meet with his support at whatever cost to  himself.
 His zeal for what he regarded as the "gospel" of atheism grew  and strengthened year by year.
 He was the untiring advocate of what he  considered the truth.
 Neither illness nor small results, nor loss, could  quench his ardor, while opposition invariably stimulated him to  fresh efforts.
 After long years of toil, he had at length attained  an influential position in the country, and though crippled by debts  incurred in the struggle for freedom of speech, and living in absolute  penury, he was one of the most powerful men of the day.
    The old bookseller had very truly observed that there was more good in  him than people thought, he was in fact a noble character twisted the  wrong way by clumsy and mistaken handling.
    Brian Osmond was by no means bigoted; he had moreover, known those who  were intimate with Raeburn, and consequently had heard enough of the  truth about him to disbelieve the gross libels which were constantly  being circulated by the unscrupulous among his opponents.
 Still, as  on that November afternoon he watched Raeburn and his daughter down  Southampton Row, he was conscious that for the first time he fully  regarded the atheist as a fellow-man.
 The fact was that Raeburn had for  long years been the champion of a hated cause; he had braved the full  flood of opposition; and like an isolated rock had been the mark for so  much of the rage and fury of the elements that people who knew him only  by name had really learned to regard him more as a target than as a man.
  It was he who could hit hardest, who could most effectually baffle and  ruin him; while the quieter spirits contented themselves with rarely  mentioning his obnoxious name, and endeavoring as far as possible, to  ignore his existence.
 Brian felt that till now he had followed with the  multitude to do evil.
 He had, as far as possible, ignored his existence;  had even been rather annoyed when his father had once publicly urged  that Raeburn should be treated with as much justice and courtesy and  consideration as if he had been a Christian.
 He had been vexed that his  father should suffer on behalf of such a man, had been half inclined to  put down the scorn and contempt and anger of the narrow-minded to the  atheist's account.
 The feeling had perhaps been natural, but all was  changed now; he only revered his father all the more for having suffered  in an unpopular cause.
 With some eagerness, he went back into the shop  to see if he could gather any more particulars from the old  bookseller.
 Charles Osmond had, however, finished his purchases and his  conversation, and was ready to go.
    "The second house in Guilford Terrace, you say?" he observed, turning  at the door.
 "Thank you.
 I shall be sure to find it.
 Good day.
"  Then turning to his son, he added, "I had no idea we were such near  neighbors! Did you hear what he told me? Mr. Raeburn lives in Guilford  Terrace.
"    "What, that miserable blind alley, do you mean at the other side of the  square?"    "Yes, and I am just going round there now, for our friend the  'book-worm' tells me he has heard it rumored that some unscrupulous  person who is going to answer Mr. Raeburn this evening, has hired a  band of roughs to make a disturbance at the meeting.
 Fancy how indignant  Donovan would be! I only wish he were here to take a word to Mr.  Raeburn.
"    "Will he not most likely have heard from some other source?" said Brian.
    "Possibly, but I shall go round and see.
 Such abominations ought to be  put down, and if by our own side all the better.
"    Brian was only too glad that his father should go, and indeed he would  probably have wished to take the message himself had not his mind been  set upon getting the best edition of Longfellow to be found in all  London for his ideal.
 So at the turning into Guilford Square, the father  and son parted.
    The bookseller's information had roused in Charles Osmond a keen sense  of indignation; he walked on rapidly as soon as he had left his son,  and in a very few minutes had reached the gloomy entrance to Guilford  Terrace.
 It was currently reported that Raeburn made fabulous sums  by his work, and lived in great luxury; but the real fact was that,  whatever his income, few men led so self-denying a life, or voluntarily  endured such privations.
 Charles Osmond could not help wishing that  he could bring some of the intolerant with him down that gloomy little  alley, to the door of that comfortless lodging house.
 He rang, and was  admitted into the narrow passage, then shown into the private study of  the great man.
 The floor was uncarpeted, the window uncurtained, the  room was almost dark; but a red-glow of fire light served to show a  large writing table strewn with papers, and walls literally lined with  books; also on the hearth-rug a little figure curled up in the most  unconventionally comfortable attitude, dividing her attention between  making toast and fondling a loud-purring cat.
        .
 Life From Another Point of View         Toleration an attack on Christianity?  What, then, are we to       come to this pass, to suppose that nothing can support       Christianity but the principles of persecution?.
.
.
  I am       persuaded that toleration, so far from being an attack on       Christianity, becomes the best and surest support that can       possibly be given to it.
.
.
.
  Toleration is good for all,       or it is good for none.
.
.
  God forbid.
  I may be mistaken,       but I take toleration to be a part of religion.
  Burke    Erica was, apparently, well used to receiving strangers.
 She put down  the toasting fork, but kept the cat in her arms, as she rose to greet  Charles Osmond, and her frank and rather child-like manner fascinated  him almost as much as it had fascinated Brian.
    "My father will be home in a few minutes," she said; "I almost wonder  you didn't meet him in the square; he has only just gone to send off a  telegram.
 Can you wait? Or will you leave a message?"    "I will wait, if I may," said Charles Osmond.
 "Oh, don't trouble about  a light.
 I like this dimness very well, and, please, don't let me  interrupt you.
"    Erica relinquished a vain search for candle lighters, and took up her  former position on the hearth rug with her toasting fork.
    "I like the gloaming, too," she said.
 "It's almost the only nice thing  which is economical! Everything else that one likes specially costs too  much! I wonder whether people with money do enjoy all the great treats.
"    "Very soon grow blase, I expect," said Charles Osmond.
 "The essence of a  treat is rarity, you see.
"    "I suppose it is.
 But I think I could enjoy ever so many things for  years and years without growing blase," said Erica.
    "Sometimes I like just to fancy what life might be if there were no  tiresome Christians, and bigots, and lawsuits.
"    Charles Osmond laughed to himself in the dim light; the remark was made  with such perfect sincerity, and it evidently had not dawned on the  speaker that she could be addressing any but one of her father's  followers.
 Yet the words saddened Him too.
 He just caught a glimpse  through them of life viewed from a directly opposite point.
    "Your father has a lawsuit going on now, has he not?" he observed, after  a little pause.
    "Oh, yes, there is almost always one either looming in the distance or  actually going on.
 I don't think I can ever remember the time when we  were quite free.
 It must feel very funny to have no worries of that  kind.
 I think, if there wasn't always this great load of debt tied round  our necks, like a millstone, I should feel almost light enough to fly.
  And then it IS hard to read in some of those horrid religious papers  that father lives an easy-going life.
 Did you see a dreadful paragraph  last week in the 'Church Chronicle?'"    "Yes, I did," said Charles Osmond, sadly.
    "It always has been the same," said Erica.
 "Father has a delightful  story about an old gentleman who at one of his lectures accused him of  being rich and self-indulgent--it was a great many years ago, when I was  a baby, and father was nearly killing himself with overwork--and he just  got up and gave the people the whole history of his day, and it turned  out that he had had nothing to eat.
 Mustn't the old gentleman have felt  delightfully done? I always wonder how he looked when he heard about  it, and whether after that he believed that atheists are not necessarily  everything that's bad.
"    "I hope such days as those are over for Mr. Raeburn," said Charles  Osmond, touched both by the anecdote and by the loving admiration of the  speaker.
    "I don't know," said Erica, sadly.
 "It has been getting steadily worse  for the last few years; we have had to give up thing after thing.
 Before  long I shouldn't wonder if these rooms in what father calls 'Persecution  alley' grew too expensive for us.
 But, after all, it is this sort of  thing which makes our own people love him so much, don't you think?"    "I have no doubt it is," said Charles Osmond, thoughtfully.
    And then for a minute or two there was silence.
 Erica, having finished  her toasting, stirred the fire into a blaze, and Charles Osmond sat  watching the fair, childish face which looked lovelier than ever in the  soft glow of the fire light.
 What would her future be, he wondered.
 She  seemed too delicate and sensitive for the stormy atmosphere in which she  lived.
 Would the hard life embitter her, or would she sink under it?  But there was a certain curve of resoluteness about her well-formed chin  which was sufficient answer to the second question, while he could not  but think that the best safeguard against the danger of bitterness lay  in her very evident love and loyalty to her father.
    Erica in the meantime sat stroking her cat Friskarina, and wondering a  little who her visitor could be.
 She liked him very much, and could  not help responding to the bright kindly eyes which seemed to plead  for confidence; though he was such an entire stranger she found herself  quite naturally opening out her heart to him.
    "I am to take notes at my father's meeting tonight," she said, breaking  the silence, "and perhaps write the account of it afterward, too, and  there's such a delightfully funny man coming to speak on the other  side.
"    "Mr. Randolph, is it not?"    "Yes, a sort of male Mrs. Malaprop.
 Oh, such fun!" and at the  remembrance of some past encounter, Erica's eyes positively danced with  laughter.
 But the next minute she was very grave.
    "I came to speak to Mr. Raeburn about this evening," said Charles  Osmond.
 "Do you know if he has heard of a rumor that this Mr. Randolph  has hired a band of roughs to interrupt the meeting?"    Erica made an indignant exclamation.
    "Perhaps that was what the telegram was about," she continued, after  a moment's thought.
 "We found it here when we came in.
 Father said  nothing, but went out very quickly to answer it.
 Oh! Now we shall have a  dreadful time of it, I suppose, and perhaps he'll get hurt again.
 I did  hope they had given up that sort of thing.
"    She looked so troubled that Charles Osmond regretted he had said  anything, and hastened to assure her that what he had heard was the  merest rumor, and very possibly not true.
    "I am afraid," she said, "it is too bad not to be true.
"    It struck Charles Osmond that that was about the saddest little sentence  he had ever heard.
    Partly wishing to change the subject, party from real interest, he made  some remark about a lovely little picture, the only one in the room; its  frame was lighted up by the flickering blaze, and even in the imperfect  light he could see that the subject was treated in no ordinary way.
  It was a little bit of the Thames far away from London, with a bank  of many-tinted trees on one side, and out beyond a range of low hills,  purple in the evening light.
 In the sky was a rosy sunset glow, melted  above into saffron color, and this was reflected in the water, gilding  and mellowing the foreground of sedge and water lilies.
 But what made  the picture specially charming was that the artist had really caught  the peculiar solemn stillness of evening; merely to look at that quiet,  peaceful river brought a feeling of hush and calmness.
 It seemed a  strange picture to find as the sole ornament in the study of a man who  had all his life been fighting the world.
    Erica brightened up again, and seemed to forget her anxiety when he  questioned her as to the artist.
    "There is such a nice story about that picture," she said, "I always  like to look at it.
 It was about two years ago, one very cold winter's  day, and a woman came with some oil paintings which she was trying to  sell for her husband, who was ill; he was rather a good artist, but had  been in bad health for a long time, till at last she had really come  to hawking about his pictures in this way, because they were in such  dreadful distress.
 Father was very much worried just then, there was a  horrid libel case going on, and that morning he was very busy, and he  sent the woman away rather sharply, and said he had no time to listen  to her.
 Then presently he was vexed with himself because she really had  looked in great trouble, and he thought he had been harsh, and, though  he was dreadfully pressed for time, he would go out into the square to  see if he couldn't find her again.
 I went with him, and we had walked  all round and had almost given her up, when we caught sight of her  coming out of a house on the opposite side.
 And then it was so nice,  father spoke so kindly to her, and found out more about her history, and  said that he was too poor to buy her pictures; but she looked dreadfully  tired and cold, so he asked her to come in and rest, and she came and  sat by the fire, and stayed to dinner with us, and we looked at her  pictures, because she seemed so proud of them and liked us to.
 One of  them was that little river scene, which father took a great fancy to,  and praised a great deal.
 She left us her address, and later on, when  the libel case was ended, and father had got damages, and so had a  little spare money, he sent some to this poor artist, and they were so  grateful; though, do you know, I think the dinner pleased them more than  the money, and they would insist on sending this picture to father.
 I'll  light the gas, and then you'll see it better.
"    She twisted a piece of paper into a spill, and put an end to the  gloaming.
 Charles Osmond stood up to get a nearer view of the painting,  and Erica, too, drew nearer, and looked at it for a minute in silence.
    "Father took me up the Thames once," she said, by and by.
 "It was so  lovely.
 Some day, when all these persecutions are over, we are going  to have a beautiful tour, and see all sorts of places.
 But I don't know  when they will be over.
 As soon as one bigot--" she broke off suddenly,  with a stifled exclamation of dismay.
    Charles Osmond, in the dim light, with his long gray beard, had not  betrayed his clerical dress; but, glancing round at him now, she saw at  once that the stranger to whom she had spoken so unreservedly was by no  means one of her father's followers.
    "Well!" he said, smiling, half understanding her confusion.
    "You are a clergyman!" she almost gasped.
    "Yes, why not?"    "I beg your pardon, I never thought--you seemed so much too--"    "Too what?" urged Charles Osmond.
 Then, as she still hesitated, "Now,  you must really let me hear the end of that sentence, or I shall imagine  everything dreadful.
"    "Too nice," murmured Erica, wishing that she could sink through the  floor.
    But the confession so tickled Charles Osmond that he laughed aloud, and  his laughter was so infectious that Erica, in spite of her confusion,  could not help joining in it.
 She had a very keen sense of the  ludicrous, and the position was undoubtedly a laughable one; still there  were certain appalling recollections of the past conversation which soon  made her serious again.
 She had talked of persecutions to one who was,  at any rate, on the side of persecutors; had alluded to bigots, and,  worst of all, had spoken in no measured terms of "tiresome Christians.
"    She turned, rather shyly, and yet with a touch of dignity, to her  visitor, and said:    "It was very careless of me not to notice more, but it was dark, and I  am not used to seeing any but our own people here.
 I am afraid I said  things which must have hurt you; I wish you had stopped me.
"    The beautiful color had spread and deepened in her cheeks, and there was  something indescribably sweet and considerate in her tone of apology.
  Charles Osmond was touched by it.
    "It is I who should apologize," he said.
 "I am not at all sure that I  was justified in sitting there quietly, knowing that you were under  a delusion; but it is always very delightful to me in this artificial  world to meet any one who talks quite naturally, and the interest of  hearing your view of the question kept me silent.
 You must forgive me,  and as you know I am too nice to be a clergyman--"    "Oh, I beg your pardon.
 How rude I have been," cried Erica, blushing  anew; "but you did make me say it.
"    "Of course, and I take it as a high compliment from you," said Charles  Osmond, laughing again at the recollection.
 "Come, may we not seal  our friendship? We have been sufficiently frank with each other to be  something more than acquaintances for the future.
"    Erica held out her hand and found it taken in a strong, firm clasp,  which somehow conveyed much more than an ordinary handshake.
    "And, after all, you ARE too nice for a clergyman!" she thought to  herself.
 Then, as a fresh idea crossed her mind, she suddenly exclaimed:  "But you came to tell us about Mr. Randolph's roughs, did you not? How  came you to care that we should know beforehand?"    "Why, naturally I hoped that a disturbance might be stopped.
"    "Is it natural?" questioned Erica.
 "I should have thought it more  natural for you to think with your own party.
"    "But peace and justice and freedom of speech must all stand before party  questions.
"    "Yet you think that we are wrong, and that Christianity is right?"    "Yes, but to my mind perfect justice is part of Christianity.
"    "Oh," said Erica, in a tone which meant unutterable things.
    "You think that Christians do not show perfect justice to you?" said  Charles Osmond, reading her thoughts.
    "I can't say I think they do," she replied.
 Then, suddenly firing up at  the recollection of her afternoon's experiences, she said: "They are not  just to us, though they preach justice; they are not loving, though they  talk about love.
 If they want us to think their religion true, I wonder  they don't practice it a little more and preach it less.
 What is the use  of talking of 'brotherly kindness and charity,' when they hardly treat  us like human beings, when they make up wicked lies about us, and will  hardly let us sit in the same room with them!"    "Come, now, we really are sitting in the same room," said Charles  Osmond, smiling.
    "Oh, dear, what am I to do!" exclaimed Erica.
 "I can't remember that you  are one of them! You are so very unlike most.
"    "I think," said Charles Osmond, "you have come across some very bad  specimens.
"    Erica, in her heart, considered her visitor as the exception which  proved the rule; but not wishing to be caught tripping again, she  resolved to say no more upon the subject.
    "Let us talk of something else," she said.
    "Something nicer?" said Charles Osmond, with a little mischievous  twinkle in his eyes.
    "Safer," said Erica, laughing.
 "But stop, I hear my father.
"    She went out into the passage to meet him.
 Charles Osmond heard her  explaining his visit and the news he had brought, heard Raeburn's  brief responses; then, in a few moments, the two entered the room, a  picturesque looking couple, the clergyman thought; the tall, stately  man, with his broad forehead and overshadowing masses of auburn hair;  the little eager-faced, impetuous girl, so winsome in her unconventional  frankness.
    The conversation became a trifle more ceremonious, though with Erica  perched on the arm of her father's chair, ready to squeeze his hand at  every word which pleased her, it could hardly become stiff.
 Raeburn had  just heard the report of Mr. Randolph's scheme, and had already taken  precautionary measures; but he was surprised and gratified that Charles  Osmond should have troubled to bring him word about it.
 The two men  talked on with the most perfect friendliness; and by and by, to Erica's  great delight, Charles Osmond expressed a wish to be present at the  meeting that night, and made inquiries as to the time and place.
    "Oh, couldn't you stay to tea and go with us?" she exclaimed, forgetting  for the third time that he was a clergyman, and offering the ready  hospitality she would have offered to any one else.
    "I should be delighted," he said, smiling, "if you can really put up  with one of the cloth.
"    Raeburn, amused at his daughter's spontaneous hospitality, and pleased  with the friendly acceptance it had met with, was quite ready to second  the invitation.
 Erica was delighted; she carried off the cat and  the toast into the next room, eager to tell her mother all about the  visitor.
    "The most delightful man, mother, not a bit like a clergyman.
 I didn't  find out for ever so long what he was, and said all sorts of dreadful  things; but he didn't mind, and was not the least offended.
"    "When will you learn to be cautious, I wonder," said Mrs. Raeburn,  smiling.
 "You are a shocking little chatter-box.
"    And as Erica flitted busily about, arranging the tea table, her mother  watched her half musedly, half anxiously.
 She had always been remarkably  frank and outspoken, and there was something so transparently sincere  about her, that she seldom gave offense.
 But the mother could not help  wondering how it would be as she grew older and mixed with a greater  variety of people.
 In fact, in every way she was anxious about the  child's future, for Erica's was a somewhat perplexing character, and  seemed very ill fitted for her position.
    Eric Haeberlein had once compared her to a violin, and there was a good  deal of truth in his idea.
 She was very sensitive, responding at once to  the merest touch, and easily moved to admiration and devoted love, or  to strong indignation.
 Naturally high-spirited, she was subject, too, to  fits of depression, and was always either in the heights or the depths.
  Yet with all these characteristics was blended her father's indomitable  courage and tenacity.
 Though feeling the thorns of life far more keenly  than most people, she was one of those who will never yield; though  pricked and wounded by outward events, she would never be conquered by  circumstances.
 At present her capabilities for adoration, which were  very great, were lavished in two directions; in the abstract she  worshipped intellect, in the concrete she worshipped her father.
    From the grief and indignation of the afternoon she had passed with  extraordinary rapidity to a state of merriment, which would have been  incomprehensible to one who did not understand her peculiarly complex  character.
 Mrs. Raeburn listened with a good deal of amusement to her  racy description of Charles Osmond.
    "Strange that this should have happened so soon after our talk this  afternoon," she said, musingly.
 "Perhaps it is as well that you should  have a glimpse of the other side, against which you were inveighing, or  you might be growing narrow.
"    "He is much too good to belong to them!" said Erica enthusiastically.
    As she spoke Raeburn entered, bringing the visitor with him, and they  all sat down to their meal, Erica pouring out tea and attending to every  one's wants, fondling her cat, and listening to the conversation, with  all the time a curious perception that to sit down to table with one of  her father's opponents was a very novel experience.
 She could not help  speculating as to the thoughts and impressions of her companions.
 Her  mother was, she thought, pleased and interested for about her worn face  there was the look of contentment which invariably came when for a  time the bitterness of the struggle of life was broken by any sign  of friendliness.
 Her father was--as he generally was in his own  house--quiet, gentle in manner, ready to be both an attentive and an  interested listener.
 This gift he had almost as markedly as the gift of  speech; he at once perceived that his guest was no ordinary man, and  by a sort of instinct he had discovered on what subjects he was best  calculated to speak, and wherein they could gain most from him.
 Charles  Osmond's thoughts she could only speculate about; but that he was ready  to take them all as friends, and did not regard them as a different  order of being, was plain.
    The conversation had drifted into regions of abstruse science, when  Erica, who had been listening attentively, was altogether diverted  by the entrance of the servant, who brought her a brown-paper parcel.
  Eagerly opening it, she was almost bewildered by the delightful surprise  of finding a complete edition of Longfellow's poems, bound in dark blue  morocco.
 Inside was written: "From another admirer of 'Hiawatha.
'"    She started up with a rapturous exclamation, and the two men paused in  their talk, each unable to help watching the beautiful little face all  aglow with happiness.
 Erica almost danced round the room with her new  treasure.
    "What HEAVENLY person can have sent me this?" she cried.
 "Look, father!  Did you ever see such a beauty?"    Science went to the winds, and Raeburn gave all his sympathy to Erica  and Longfellow.
 "The very thing you were wishing for.
 Who could have  sent it?"    "I can't think.
 It can't be Tom, because I know he's spent all his  money, and auntie would never call herself an admirer of 'Hiawatha,' nor  Herr Haeberlein, nor Monsieur Noirol, nor any one I can think of.
"    "Dealings with the fairies," said Raeburn, smiling.
 "Your beggar-child  with the scones suddenly transformed into a beneficent rewarder.
"    "Not from you, father?"    Raeburn laughed.
    "A pretty substantial fairy for you.
 No, no, I had no hand in it.
 I  can't give you presents while I am in debt, my bairn.
"    "Oh, isn't it jolly to get what one wants!" said Erica, with a fervor  which made the three grown-up people laugh.
    "Very jolly," said Raeburn, giving her a little mute caress.
    "But now, Erica, please to go back and eat something, or I shall have my  reporter fainting in the middle of a speech.
"    She obeyed, carrying away the book with her, and enlivening them with  extracts from it; once delightedly discovering a most appropriate  passage.
    "Why, of course," she exclaimed, "you and Mr. Osmond, father, are  smoking the Peace Pipe.
" And with much force and animation she read them  bits from the first canto.
    Raeburn left the room before long to get ready for his meeting, but  Erica still lingered over her new treasure, putting it down at length  with great reluctance to prepare her notebook and sharpen her pencil.
  "Isn't that a delightful bit where Hiawatha was angry," she said; "it  has been running in my head all day--         "'For his heart was hot within him,       Like a living coal his heart was.
'    That's what I shall feel like tonight when Mr. Randolph attacks father.
"    She ran upstairs to dress, and, as the door closed upon her, Mrs.  Raeburn turned to Charles Osmond with a sort of apology.
    "She finds it very hard not to speak out her thoughts; it will often get  her into trouble, I am afraid.
"    "It is too fresh and delightful to be checked, though," said Charles  Osmond; "I assure you she has taught me many a lesson tonight.
"    The mother talked on almost unreservedly about the subject that was  evidently nearest her heart--the difficulties of Erica's education,  the harshness they so often met with, the harm it so evidently did the  child--till the subject of the conversation came down again much too  excited and happy to care just then for any unkind treatment.
 Had  she not got a Longfellow of her very own, and did not that unexpected  pleasure make up for a thousand privations and discomforts?    Yet, with all her childishness and impetuosity, Erica was womanly, too,  as Charles Osmond saw by the way she waited on her mother, thinking of  everything which the invalid could possibly want while they were gone,  brightening the whole place with her sunshiny presence.
 Whatever  else was lacking, there was no lack of love in this house.
 The tender  considerateness which softened Erica's impetuosity in her mother's  presence, the loving comprehension, between parent and child, was very  beautiful to see.
        .
 "Supposing it is true!"         A man who strives earnestly and perseveringly to convince       others, at least convinces us that he is convinced himself.
       Guesses at Truth.
         The rainy afternoon had given place to a fine and starlit       night.
 Erica, apparently in high spirits, walked between her       father and Charles Osmond.
    "Mother won't be anxious about us," she said.
 "She has not heard a word  about Mr. Randolph's plans.
 I was so afraid some one would speak  about it at tea time, and then she would have been in a fright all the  evening, and would not have liked my going.
"    "Mr. Randolph is both energetic and unscrupulous," said Raeburn.
 "But  I doubt if even he would set his roughs upon you, little one, unless  he has become as blood thirsty as a certain old Scotch psalm we used to  sing.
"    "What was that?" questioned Erica.
    "I forget the beginning, but the last verse always had a sort of  horrible fascination for us--    "'How happy should that trooper be Who, riding on a naggie, Should take  thy little children up, And dash them 'gin the craggie!'"    Charles Osmond and Erica laughed heartily.
    "They will only dash you against metaphorical rocks in the nineteenth  century," continued Raeburn.
 "I remember wondering why the old clerk in  my father's church always sung that verse lustily; but you see we have  exactly the same spirit now, only in a more civilized form, barbarity  changed to polite cruelty, as for instance the way you were treated this  afternoon.
"    "Oh, don't talk about that," said Erica, quickly, "I am going to enjoy  my Longfellow and forget the rest.
"    In truth, Charles Osmond was struck with this both in the father and  daughter; each had a way of putting back their bitter thoughts, of  dwelling whenever it was possible on the brighter side of life.
 He knew  that Raeburn was involved in most harassing litigation, was burdened  with debt, was confronted everywhere with bitter and often violent  opposition, yet he seemed to live above it all, for there was a  wonderful repose about him, an extraordinary serenity in his aspect,  which would have seemed better fitted to a hermit than to one who has  spent his life in fighting against desperate odds.
 One thing was quite  clear, the man was absolutely convinced that he was suffering for  the truth, and was ready to endure anything in what he considered the  service of his fellow men.
 He did not seem particularly anxious as to  the evening's proceedings.
 On the whole, they were rather a merry party  as they walked along Gower Street to the station.
    But when they got out again at their destination, and walked through the  busy streets to the hall where the lecture was to be given, a sort of  seriousness fell upon all three.
 They were each going to work in their  different ways for what they considered the good of humanity, and  instinctively a silence grew and deepened.
    Erica was the first to break it as they came in sight of the hall.
    "What a crowd there is!" she exclaimed.
 "Are these Mr. Randolph's  roughs?"    "We can put up with them outside," said Raeburn; but Charles Osmond  noticed that as he spoke he drew the child nearer to him, with a  momentary look of trouble in his face, as though he shrunk from taking  her through the rabble.
 Erica, on the other hand, looked interested  and perfectly fearless.
 With great difficulty they forced their way  on, hooted and yelled at by the mob, who, however, made no attempt at  violence.
 At length, reaching the shelter of the entrance lobby, Raeburn  left them for a moment, pausing to give directions to the door keepers.
  Just then, to his great surprise, Charles Osmond caught sight of his  son standing only a few paces from them.
 His exclamation of astonishment  made Erica look up.
 Brian came forward eagerly to meet them.
    "You here!" exclaimed his father, with a latent suspicion confirmed into  a certainty.
 "This is my son, Miss Raeburn.
"    Brian had not dreamed of meeting her, he had waited about curious to  see how Raeburn would get on with the mob; it was with a strange pang  of rapture and dismay that he had seen his fair little ideal.
 That she  should be in the midst of that hooting mob made his heart throb with  indignation, yet there was something so sweet in her grave, steadfast  face that he was, nevertheless, glad to have witnessed the scene.
 Her  color was rather heightened, her eyes bright but very quiet, yet as  Charles Osmond spoke, and she looked at Brian, her face all at once  lighted up, and with an irresistible smile she exclaimed, in the most  childlike of voices:    "Why, it's my umbrella man!" The informality of the exclamation seemed  to make them at once something more than ordinary acquaintances.
 They  told Charles Osmond of their encounter in the afternoon, and in a very  few minutes Brian, hardly knowing whether he was not in some strange  dream, found himself sitting with his father and Erica in a crowded  lecture hall, realizing with an intensity of joy and an intensity of  pain how near he was to the queen of his heart and yet how far from her.
    The meeting was quite orderly.
 Though Raeburn was addressing many  who disagreed with him, he had evidently got the whole and undivided  attention of his audience; and indeed his gifts both as rhetorician and  orator were so great that they must have been either willfully deaf or  obtuse who, when under the spell of his extraordinary earnestness and  eloquence, could resist listening.
 Not a word was lost on Brian; every  sentence which emphasized the great difference of belief between himself  and his love seemed to engrave itself on his heart; no minutest detail  of that evening escaped him.
    He saw the tall, commanding figure of the orator, the vast sea of  upturned faces below, the eager attention imprinted on all, sometimes a  wave of sympathy and approval sweeping over them, resulting in a storm  of applause, at times a more divided disapproval, or a shout of "No,  no," which invariably roused the speaker to a more vigorous, clear, and  emphatic repetition of the questioned statement.
 And, through all, he  was ever conscious of the young girl at his side, who, with her head  bent over her notebook, was absorbed in her work.
 While the most vital  questions of life were being discussed, he was yet always aware of that  hand traveling rapidly to and fro, of the pages hurriedly turned, of the  quick yet weary-looking change of posture.
    Though not without a strong vein of sarcasm, Raeburn's speech was,  on the whole, temperate; it certainly should have been met with  consideration.
 But, unfortunately, Mr. Randolph was incapable of seeing  any good in his opponent; his combative instincts were far stronger than  his Christianity, and Brian, who had winced many times while listening  to the champion of atheism, was even more keenly wounded by the champion  of his own cause.
 Abusive epithets abounded in his retort; at last  he left the subject under discussion altogether, and launched into  personalities of the most objectionable kind.
 Raeburn sat with folded  arms, listening with a sort of cold dignity.
 He looked very different  now from the genial-mannered, quiet man whom Charles Osmond had seen in  his own home but an hour or two ago.
 There was a peculiar look in his  tawny eyes hardly to be described in words, a look which was hard, and  cold, and steady.
 It told of an originally sensitive nature inured to  ill treatment; of a strong will which had long ago steeled itself to  endure; of a character which, though absolutely refusing to yield to  opposition, had grown slightly bitter, even slightly vindictive in the  process.
    Brian could only watch in silent pain the little figure beside him.
 Once  at some violent term of abuse she looked up, and glanced for a moment  at the speaker; he just caught a swift, indignant flash from her bright  eyes, then her head was bent lower than before over her notebook, and  the carnation deepened in her cheek, while her pencil sped over the  paper fast and furiously.
 Presently came a sharp retort from Raeburn,  ending with the perfectly warrantable accusation that Mr. Randolph was  wandering from the subject of the evening merely to indulge his personal  spite.
 The audience was beginning to be roused by the unfairness, and a  storm might have ensued had not Mr. Randolph unintentionally turned the  whole proceedings from tragedy to farce.
    Indignant at Raeburn's accusation, he sprung to his feet and began a  vigorous protest.
    "Mr. Chairman, I denounce my opponent as a liar.
 His accusation is  utterly false.
 I deny the allegation, and I scorn the alligator--"    He was interrupted by a shout of laughter, the whole assembly was  convulsed, even Erica's anger changed to mirth.
    "Fit for 'Punch,'" she whispered to Brian, her face all beaming with  merriment.
    Raeburn, whose grave face had also relaxed into a smile, suddenly stood  up, and, with a sort of dry Scotch humor, remarked:    "My enemies have compared me to many obnoxious things, but never till  tonight have I been called a crocodile.
 Possibly Mr. Randolph has been  reading of the crocodiles recently dissected at Paris.
 It has been  discovered that they are almost brainless, and, being without reason,  are probably animated by a violent instinct of destruction.
 I believe,  however, that the power of their 'jaw' is unsurpassed.
"    Then, amid shouts of laughter and applause, he sat down again, leaving  the field to the much discomfited Mr. Randolph.
    Much harm had been done that evening to the cause of Christianity.
 The  sympathies of the audience could not be with the weak and unmannerly Mr.  Randolph; they were Englishmen, and were, of course, inclined to side  with the man who had been unjustly dealt with, who, moreover, had really  spoken to them--had touched their very hearts.
    The field was practically lost when, to the surprise of all, another  speaker came forward.
 Erica, who knew that their side had had the best  of it, felt a thrill of admiration when she saw Charles Osmond move  slowly to the front of the platform.
 She was very tired, but out of a  sort of gratitude for his friendliness, a readiness to do him honor,  she strained her energies to take down his speech verbatim.
 It was not  a long one, it was hardly, perhaps, to be called a speech at all, it was  rather as if the man had thrown his very self into the breach made by  the unhappy wrangle of the evening.
    He spoke of the universal brotherhood and of the wrong done to it  by bitterness and strife; he stood there as the very incarnation of  brotherliness, and the people, whether they agreed with him or not,  loved him.
 In the place where the religion of Christ had been reviled  as well by the Christians as by the atheist, he spoke of the revealer  of the Father, and a hush fell on the listening men; he spoke of the  Founder of the great brotherhood, and by the very reality, by the fervor  of his convictions, touched a new chord in many a heart.
 It was no time  for argument, the meeting was almost over; he scarcely attempted to  answer to many of the difficulties and objections raised by Raeburn  earlier in the evening.
 But there was in his ten minutes' speech the  whole essence of Christianity, the spirit of loving sacrifice to  self, the strength of an absolute certainty which no argument, however  logical, can shake, the extraordinary power which breathes in the  assertion: "I KNOW Him whom I have believed.
"    To more than one of Raeburn's followers there came just the slightest  agitation of doubt, the questioning whether these things might not be.
  For the first time in her life the question began to stir in Erica's  heart.
 She had heard many advocates of Christianity, and had regarded  them much as we might regard Buddhist missionaries speaking of a  religion that had had its day and was now only fit to be discarded, or  perhaps studied as an interesting relic of the past, about which in its  later years many corruptions had gathered.
    Raeburn, being above all things a just man, had been determined to give  her mind no bias in favor of his own views, and as a child he had left  her perfectly free.
 But there was a certain Scotch proverb which he did  not call to mind, that "As the auld cock crows the young cock learns.
"  When the time came at which he considered her old enough really to study  the Bible for herself, she had already learned from bitter experience  that Christianity--at any rate, what called itself Christianity--was the  religion whose votaries were constantly slandering and ill-treating  her father, and that all the privations and troubles of their life were  directly or indirectly due to it.
 She, of course, identified the conduct  of the most unfriendly and persecuting with the religion itself; it  could hardly be otherwise.
    But tonight as she toiled away, bravely acting up to her lights,  taking down the opponent's speech to the best of her abilities, though  predisposed to think it all a meaningless rhapsody, the faintest attempt  at a question began to take shape in her mind.
 It did not form  itself exactly into words, but just lurked there like a  cloud-shadow--"supposing Christianity were true?"    All doubt is pain.
 Even this faint beginning of doubt in her creed made  Erica dreadfully uncomfortable.
 Yet she could not regret that Charles  Osmond had spoken, even though she imagined him to be greatly mistaken,  and feared that that uncomfortable question might have been suggested  to others among the audience.
 She could not wish that the speech had  not been made, for it had revealed the nobility of the man, his  broad-hearted love, and she instinctively reverenced all the really  great and good, however widely different their creeds.
    Brian tried in vain to read her thoughts, but as soon as the meeting was  over her temporary seriousness vanished, and she was once more almost a  child again, ready to be amused by anything.
 She stood for a few minutes  talking to the two Osmonds; then, catching sight of an acquaintance  a little way off, she bade them a hasty good night, much to Brian's  chagrin, and hurried forward with a warmth of greeting which he could  only hope was appreciated by the thickset, honest-looking mechanic who  was the happy recipient.
 When they left the hall she was still deep in  conversation with him.
    The fates were kind, however, to Brian that day; they were just too late  for a train, and before the next one arrived, Raeburn and Erica were  seen slowly coming down the steps, and in another minute had joined  them on the platform.
 Charles Osmond and Raeburn fell into an amicable  discussion, and Brian, to his great satisfaction, was left to an  uninterrupted tete-a-tete with Erica.
 There had been no further  demonstration by the crowd, and Erica, now that the anxiety was over,  was ready to make fun of Mr. Randolph and his band, checking herself  every now and then for fear of hurting her companion, but breaking  forth again and again into irresistible merriment as she recalled the  "alligator" incident and other grotesque utterances.
 All too soon they  reached their destination.
 There was still, however, a ten minutes' walk  before them, a walk which Brian never forgot.
 The wind was high, and it  seemed to excite Erica; he could always remember exactly how she looked,  her eyes bright and shining, her short, auburn hair, all blown about by  the wind, one stray wave lying across the quaint little sealskin hat.
 He  remembered, too, how, in the middle of his argument, Raeburn had stepped  forward and had wrapped a white woolen scarf more closely round the  child, securing the fluttering ends.
 Brian would have liked to do it  himself had he dared, and yet it pleased him, too, to see the father's  thoughtfulness; perhaps in that "touch of nature," he, for the first  time, fully recognized his kinship with the atheist.
    Erica talked to him in the meantime with a delicious, childlike  frankness, gave him an enthusiastic account of her friend, Hazeldine,  the working man whom he had seen her speaking to, and unconsciously  reveled in her free conversation a great deal of the life she led, a  busy, earnest, self-denying life Brian could see.
 When they reached the  place of their afternoon's encounter, she alluded merrily to what she  called the "charge of umbrellas.
"    "Who would have thought, now, that in a few hours' time we should have  learned to know each other!" she exclaimed.
 "It has been altogether the  very oddest day, a sort of sandwich of good and bad, two bits of the  dry bread of persecution, put in between, you and Mr. Osmond and my  beautiful new Longfellow.
"    Brian could not help laughing at the simile, and was not a little  pleased to hear the reference to his book; but his amusement was soon  dispelled by a grim little incident.
 Just at that minute they happened  to pass an undertaker's cart which was standing at the door of one of  the houses; a coffin was born across the pavement in front of them.
  Erica, with a quick exclamation, put her hand on his arm and shrank back  to make room for the bearers to pass.
 Looking down at her, he saw that  she was quite pale.
 The coffin was carried into the house and they  passed on.
    "How I do hate seeing anything like that!" she exclaimed.
 Then looking  back and up to the windows of the house: "Poor people! I wonder whether  they are very sad.
 It seems to make all the world dark when one comes  across such things.
 Father thinks it is good to be reminded of the  end, that it makes one more eager to work, but he doesn't even wish for  anything after death, nor do any of the best people I know.
 It is  silly of me, but I never can bear to think of quite coming to an end, I  suppose because I am not so unselfish as the others.
"    "Or may it not be a natural instinct, which is implanted in all, which  perhaps you have not yet crushed by argument.
"    Erica shook her head.
    "More likely to be a little bit of one of my covenanting ancestors  coming out in me.
 Still, I own that the hope of the hereafter is the one  point in which you have the better of it.
 Life must seem very easy if  you believe that all will be made up to you and all wrong set right  after you are dead.
 You see we have rather hard measure here, and don't  expect anything at all by and by.
 But all the same, I am always rather  ashamed of this instinct, or selfishness, or Scottish inheritance,  whichever it is!"    "Ashamed! Why should you be?"    "It is a sort of weakness, I think, which strong characters like my  father are without.
 You see he cares so much for every one, and thinks  so much of making the world a little less miserable in this generation,  but most of my love is for him and for my mother; and so when I think of  death--of their death--" she broke off abruptly.
    "Yet do not call it selfishness," said Brian, with a slightly choked  feeling, for there had been a depth of pain in Erica's tone.
 "My father,  who has just that love of humanity of which you speak, has still the  most absolute belief in--yes, and longing for--immortality.
 It is no  selfishness in him.
"    "I am sure it is not," said Erica, warmly, "I shouldn't think he could  be selfish in any way.
 I am glad he spoke tonight; it does one good to  hear a speech like that, even if one doesn't agree with it.
 I wish  there were a few more clergymen like him, then perhaps the tolerance and  brotherliness he spoke of might become possible.
 But it must be a long  way off, or it would not seem such an unheard-of thing that I should  be talking like this to you.
 Why, it is the first time in my whole  life that I have spoken to a Christian except on the most every-day  subjects.
"    "Then I hope you won't let it be the last," said Brian.
    "I should like to know Mr. Osmond better," said Erica, "for you know it  seems very extraordinary to me that a clever scientific man can speak  as he spoke tonight.
 I should like to know how you reconcile all the  contradictions, how you can believe what seems to me so unlikely, how  even if you do believe in a God you can think Him good while the world  is what it is.
 If there is a good God why doesn't He make us all know  Him, and end all the evil and cruelty?"    Brian did not reply for a moment.
 The familiar gas-lit street, the usual  number of passengers, the usual care-worn or vice-worn faces passing by,  damp pavements, muddy roads, fresh winter wind, all seemed so natural,  but to talk of the deepest things in heaven and earth was so unnatural.
  He was a very reserved man, but looking down at the eager, questioning  face beside him his reserve all at once melted.
 He spoke very quietly,  but in a voice which showed Erica that he was, at least, as she  expressed it "honestly deluded.
" Evidently he did from his very heart  believe what he said.
    "But how are we to judge what is best?" he replied.
 "My belief is that  God is slowly and gradually educating the world, not forcing it on  unnaturally, but drawing it on step by step, making it work out its own  lessons as the best teachers do with their pupils.
 To me the idea of a  steady progression, in which man himself may be a co-worker with God, is  far more beautiful than the conception of a Being who does not work by  natural laws at all, but arbitrarily causes this and that to be or not  to be.
"    "But then if your God is educating the world, He is educating many of  us in ignorance of Himself, in atheism.
 How can that be good or right?  Surely you, for instance, must be rather puzzled when you come across  atheists, if you believe in a perfect God, and think atheism the most  fearful mistake possible?"    "If I could not believe that God can, and does, educate some of us  through atheism, I should indeed be miserable," said Brian, with a  thrill of pain in his voice which startled Erica.
 "But I do believe that  even atheism, even blank ignorance of Him, may be a stage through which  alone some of us can be brought onward.
 The noblest man I ever knew  passed through that state, and I can't think he would have been half the  man he is if he had not passed through it.
"    "I have only known two or three people who from atheists became theists,  and they were horrid," said Erica, emphatically.
 "People always are  spiteful to the side they have left.
"    "You could not say that of my friend," said Brian, musingly, "I wish you  could meet him.
"    They had reached the entrance to Guilford Terrace, Raeburn and Charles  Osmond overtook them, and the conversation ended abruptly.
 Perhaps  because Erica had made no answer to the last remark, and was conscious  of a touch of malice in her former speech, she put a little additional  warmth into her farewell.
 At any rate, there was that which touched  Brian's very heart in the frank innocence of her hand clasp, in the  sweet yet questioning eyes that were raised to his.
    He turned away, happier and yet sadder than he had ever been in his  life.
 Not a word passed between him and his father as they crossed the  square, but when they reached home they instinctively drew together over  the study fire.
 There was a long silence even then, broken at last by  Charles Osmond.
    "Well, my son?" he said.
    "I cannot see how I can be of the least use to her," said Brian,  abruptly, as if his father had been following the whole of his train of  thought, which, indeed, to a certain extent, he had.
    "Was this afternoon your first meeting?"      "Our first speaking.
 I have seen her many times, but only today realized  what she is.
"    "Well, your little Undine is very bewitching, and much more than  bewitching, true to the core and loyal and loving.
 If only the hardness  of her life does not embitter her, I think she will make a grand woman.
"    "Tell me what you did this afternoon," said Brian; "you must have been  some time with them.
"    Charles Osmond told him all that had passed; then continued:    "She is, as I said, a fascinating, bright little Undine, inclined to be  willful, I should fancy, and with a sort of warmth and quickness about  her whole character, in many ways still a child, and yet in others  strangely old for her years; on the whole I should say as fair a  specimen of the purely natural being as you would often meet with.
 The  spiritual part of her is, I fancy, asleep.
"    "No, I fancy tonight has made it stir for the first time," said Brian,  and he told his father a little of what had passed between himself and  Erica.
    "And the Longfellow was, I suppose, from you," said Charles Osmond.
 "I  wish you could have seen her delight over it.
 Words absolutely failed  her.
 I don't think any one else noticed it, but, her own vocabulary  coming to an end, she turned to ours, it was 'What HEAVENLY person can  have sent me this?'"    Brian smiled, but sighed too.
    "One talks of the spiritual side remaining untouched," he said, "yet how  is it ever to be otherwise than chained and fettered, while such men  as that Randolph are recognized as the champions of our cause, while  injustice and unkindness meet her at every turn, while it is something  rare and extraordinary for a Christian to speak a kind word to her.
 If  today she has first realized that Christians need not necessarily behave  as brutes, I have realized a little what life is from her point of  view.
"    "Then, realizing that perhaps you may help her, perhaps another chapter  of the old legend may come true, and you may be the means of waking the  spirit in your Undine.
"    "I? Oh, no! How can you think of it! You or Donovan, perhaps, but even  that idea seems to me wildly improbable.
"    There was something in his humility and sadness which touched his father  inexpressibly.
    "Well," he said, after a pause, "if you are really prepared for all the  suffering this love must bring you, if you mean to take it, and cherish  it, and live for it, even though it brings you no gain, but apparent  pain and loss, then I think it can only raise both you and your Undine.
"    Brian knew that not one man in a thousand would have spoken in such a  way; his father's unworldliness was borne in upon him as it had never  been before.
 Greatly as he had always reverenced and loved him, tonight  his love and reverence deepened unspeakably--the two were drawn nearer  to each other than ever.
    It was not the habit in this house to make the most sacred ties of life  the butt for ill-timed and ill-judged joking.
 No knight of old thought  or spoke more reverently or with greater reserve of his lady love than  did Brian of Erica.
 He regarded himself now as one bound to do her  service, consecrated from that day forward as her loyal knight.
        .
 Erica's Resolve         Men are tattooed with their special beliefs like so many       South Sea Islanders; but a real human heart, with Divine       love in it, beats with the same glow under all the patterns       of all earth's thousand tribes.
  O.
 Wendell Holmes.
    For the next fortnight Brian and Erica continued to pass each other  every afternoon in Gower Street, as they had done for so long, the only  difference was that now they greeted each other, that occasionally Brian  would be rendered happy for the rest of the day by some brief passing  remark from his Undine, or by one of her peculiarly bright smiles.
 One  day, however, she actually stopped; her face was radiant.
    "I must just tell you our good news," she said.
 "My father has won his  case, and has got heavy damages.
"    "I am very glad," said Brian.
 "It must be a great relief to you all to  have it over.
"    "Immense! Father looks as if a ton's weight had been taken off his mind.
  Now I hope we shall have a little peace.
"    With a hasty good bye she hurried on, an unusual elasticity in her  light footsteps.
 In Guilford Square she met a political friend of her  father's, and was brought once more to a standstill.
 This time it was a  little unwillingly, for M.
 Noirol teased her unmercifully, and at their  last meeting had almost made her angry by talking of a friend of his  at Paris who offered untold advantages to any clever and well-educated  English girl who wished to learn the language, and who would in return  teach her own.
 Erica had been made miserable by the mere suggestion that  such a situation would suit her; the slightest hint that it might be  well for her to go abroad had roused in her a sort of terror lest her  father might ever seriously think of the scheme.
 She had not quite  forgiven M.
 Noirol for having spoken, although the proposal had not  been gravely made, and probably only persevered in out of the spirit of  teasing.
 But today M.
 Noirol looked very grave.
    "You have heard our good news?" said Erica.
 "Now don't begin again about  Madame Lemercier's school; I don't want to be made cross today of all  days, when I am so happy.
"    "I will tease you no more, dear mademoiselle," said the Frenchman; but  he offered no congratulations, and there was something in his manner  which made Erica uneasy.
    "Is anything wrong? Has anything happened?" she asked quickly.
    The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.
    "Who knows! It is an evil world, Mademoiselle Erica, as you will realize  when you have lived in it as long as I have.
 But I detain you.
 Good bye.
  AU REVOIR!"    He took off his hat with a flourish, and passed on.
    Erica, feeling baffled and a little cross, hurried home.
 M.
 Noirol had  not teased her today, but he had been inscrutable and tiresome, and he  had made her feel uneasy.
 She opened the front door, and went at once to  her father's study, pausing for a moment at the sound of voices within.
  She recognized, however, that it was her cousin, Tom Craigie, who was  speaking, and without more delay she entered.
 Then in a moment she  understood why M.
 Noirol had been so mysterious.
 Tom was speaking  quickly and strongly, and there was a glow of anger on his face.
 Her  father was standing with his back to the mantlepiece, and there was a  sort of cold light in his eyes, which filled Erica with dismay.
 Never  in the most anxious days had she seen him look at once so angry, yet as  weighed down with care.
    "What is the matter?" she questioned, breathlessly, instinctively  turning to Tom, whose hot anger was more approachable.
    "The scamp of a Christian has gone bankrupt," he said, referring to  the defendant in the late action, but too furious to speak very  intelligibly.
    "Mr. Cheale, you mean?" asked Erica.
    "The scoundrel! Yes! So not a farthing of costs and damages shall we  see! It is the most fiendish thing ever heard of!"    "Will the costs be very heavy?"    "Heavy! I should think they would indeed!" He named the probable sum; it  seemed a fearful addition to the already existing burden of debts.
    A look of such pain and perplexity came over Erica's face that Raeburn  for the first time realizing what was passing in the room, drew her  toward him, his face softening, and the cold, angry light in his eyes  changing to sadness.
    "Never mind, my child," he said, with a sigh.
 "'Tis a hard blow, but we  must bear up.
 Injustice won't triumph in the end.
"    There was something in his voice and look which made Erica feel  dreadfully inclined to cry; but that would have disgraced her forever in  the eyes of stoical Tom, so she only squeezed his hand hard and tried  to think of that far-distant future of which she had spoken to Charles  Osmond, when there would be no tiresome Christians and bigots and  lawsuits.
    There was, however, one person in the house who was invariably the  recipient of all the troubled confidences of others.
 In a very few  minutes Erica had left the study and was curled up beside her  mother's couch, talking out unreservedly all her grief, and anger, and  perplexity.
    Mrs. Raeburn, delicate and invalided as she was, had nevertheless a  great deal of influence, though perhaps neither Raeburn, nor Erica, nor  warm-hearted Tom Craigie understood how much she did for them all.
 She  was so unassuming, so little given to unnecessary speech, so reticent,  that her life made very little show, while it had become so entirely a  matter of course that every one should bring his private troubles to  her that it would have seemed extraordinary not to meet with exactly  the sympathy and counsel needed.
 Today, however, even Mrs. Raeburn was  almost too despondent to cheer the others.
 It comforted Erica to talk  to her, but she could not help feeling very miserable as she saw the  anxiety and sadness in her mother's face.
    "What more can we do, mother?" she questioned.
 "I can't think of a  single thing we can give up.
"    "I really don't know, dear," said her mother with a sigh.
 "We have  nothing but the absolute necessaries of life now, except indeed your  education at the High School, and that is a very trifling expense, and  one which cannot be interfered with.
"    Erica was easily depressed, like most high-spirited persons; but she was  not used to seeing either her father or her mother despondent, and the  mere strangeness kept her from going down to the very deepest depths.
  She had the feeling that at least one of them must try to keep up.
 Yet,  do what she would, that evening was one of the saddest and dreariest she  had ever spent.
 All the excitement of contest was over, and a sort of  dead weight of gloom seemed to oppress them.
 Raeburn was absolutely  silent.
 From the first Erica had never heard him complain, but his  anger, and afterward his intense depression, spoke volumes.
 Even Tom,  her friend and play fellow, seemed changed this evening, grown somehow  from a boy to a man; for there was a sternness about him which she had  never seen before, and which made the days of their childhood seem far  away.
 And yet it was not so very long ago that she and Tom had been the  most light-hearted and careless beings in the world, and had imagined  the chief interest of life to consist in tending dormice, and tame rats,  and silk worms! She wondered whether they could ever feel free again,  whether they could ever enjoy their long Saturday afternoon rambles, or  whether this weight of care would always be upon them.
    With a very heavy heart she prepared her lessons for the next day,  finding it hard to take much interest in Magna Charta and legal  enactments in the time of King John, when the legal enactments of today  were so much more mind-engrossing.
 Tom was sitting opposite to her,  writing letters for Raeburn.
 Once, notwithstanding his grave looks, she  hazarded a question.
 "Tom," she said, shutting up her 'History of the  English People,' "Tom, what do you think will happen?"    Tom looked across at her with angry yet sorrowful eyes.
    "I think," he said, sternly, "that the chieftain will try to do the work  of ten men at once, and will pay off these debts or die in the attempt.
"    The "chieftain" was a favorite name among the Raeburnites for their  leader, and there was a great deal of the clan feeling among them.
 The  majority of them were earnest, hard-working, thoughtful men, and their  society was both powerful and well-organized, while their personal  devotion to Raeburn lent a vigor and vitality to the whole body which  might otherwise have been lacking.
 Perhaps comparatively few would  have been enthusiastic for the cause of atheism had not that cause been  represented by a high-souled, self-denying man whom they loved with all  their hearts.
    The dreary evening ended at length, Erica helped her mother to bed, and  then with slow steps climbed up to her little attic room.
 It was cold  and comfortless enough, bare of all luxuries, but even here the walls  were lined with books, and Erica's little iron bedstead looked somewhat  incongruous surrounded as it was with dingy-looking volumes, dusky  old legal books, works of reference, books atheistical, theological,  metaphysical, or scientific.
 On one shelf, amid this strangely  heterogeneous collection, she kept her own particular treasures--Brian's  Longfellow, one or two of Dickens's books which Tom had given her, and  the beloved old Grimm and Hans Andersen, which had been the friends  of her childhood and which for "old sakes' sake" she had never had the  heart to sell.
 The only other trace of her in the strange little bedroom  was in a wonderful array of china animals on the mantlepiece.
 She was a  great animal lover, and, being a favorite with every one, she received  many votive offerings.
 Her shrine was an amusing one to look at.
 A green  china frog played a tuneless guitar; a pensive monkey gazed with clasped  hands and dreadfully human eyes into futurity; there were sagacious  looking elephants, placid rhinoceroses, rampant hares, two pug dogs  clasped in an irrevocable embrace, an enormous lobster, a diminutive  polar bear, and in the center of all a most evil-looking jackdaw about  half an inch high.
    But tonight the childish side of Erica was in abeyance; the cares of  womanhood seemed gathering upon her.
 She put out her candle and sat down  in the dark, racking her brain for some plan by which to relieve her  father and mother.
 Their life was growing harder and harder.
 It  seemed to her that poverty in itself was bearable enough, but that the  ever-increasing load of debt was not bearable.
 As long as she could  remember, it had always been like a mill-stone tied about their necks,  and the ceaseless petty economies and privations seemed of little avail;  she felt very much as if she were one of the Danaids, doomed forever to  pour water into a vessel with a hole in it.
    Yet in one sense she was better off than many, for these debts were not  selfish debts--no one had ever known Raeburn to spend an unnecessary  sixpence on himself; all this load had been incurred in the defense of  what he considered the truth--by his unceasing struggles for liberty.
  She was proud of the debts, proud to suffer in what she regarded as  the sacred cause; but in spite of that she was almost in despair this  evening, the future looked so hopelessly black.
    Tom's words rang in her head--"The chieftain will try to do the work of  ten men!" What if he overworked himself as he had done once a few years  ago? What if he died in the attempt? She wished Tom had not spoken so  strongly.
 In the friendly darkness she did not try to check the tears  which would come into her eyes at the thought.
 Something must be done!  She must in some way help him! And then, all at once, there flashed into  her mind M.
 Noirol's teasing suggestion that she should go to Paris.
  Here was a way in which, free of all expense, she might finish her  education, might practically earn her living! In this way she might  indeed help to lighten the load, but it would be at the cost of absolute  self-sacrifice.
 She must leave home, and father and mother, and country!    Erica was not exactly selfish, but she was very young.
 The thought of  the voluntary sacrifice seemed quite unbearable, she could not make up  her mind to it.
    "Why should I give up all this? Why should prejudice and bigotry spoil  my whole life?" she thought, beginning to pace up and down the room with  quick, agitated steps.
 "Why should we suffer because that wretch has  gone bankrupt? It is unfair, unjust, it can't be right.
"    She leaned her arms on the window sill and looked out into the silent  night.
 The stars were shining peacefully enough, looking down on this  world of strife and struggle; Erica grew a little calmer as she looked;  Nature, with its majesty of calmness, seemed to quiet her troubled heart  and "sweep gradual-gospels in.
"    From some recess of memory there came to her some half-enigmatical  words; they had been quoted by Charles Osmond in his speech, but she did  not remember where she had heard them, only they began to ring in her  ears now:    "There is no gain except by loss, There is no life except by death, Nor  glory but by bearing shame, Nor justice but by taking blame.
"    She did not altogether understand the verse, but there was a truth in  it which could hardly fail to come home to one who knew what persecution  meant.
 What if the very blame and injustice of the present brought  in the future reign of justice! She seemed to hear her father's voice  saying again, "We must bear up, child; injustice won't triumph in the  end.
"    "There is no gain except by loss!"    What if her loss of home and friends brought gain to the world! That was  a thought which brought a glow of happiness to her even in the midst of  her pain.
 There was, after all, much of the highest Christianity about  her, though she would have been very much vexed if any one had told  her so, because Christianity meant to her narrow-mindedness instead of  brotherly love.
 However it might be, there was no denying that the child  of the great teacher of atheism had grasped the true meaning of life,  had grasped it, and was prepared to act on it too.
 She had always lived  with those who were ready to spend all in the promotion of the general  good; and all that was true, all that was noble in her creed, all that  had filled her with admiration in the lives of those she loved, came to  her aid now.
    She went softly down the dark staircase to Raeburn's study; it was late,  and, anxious not to disturb the rest of the house, she opened the door  noiselessly and crept in.
 Her father was sitting at his desk writing;  he looked very stern, but there was a sort of grandeur about his rugged  face.
 He was absorbed in his work and did not hear her, and for a minute  she stood quite still watching him, realizing with pain and yet with  a happy pride how greatly she loved him.
 Her heart beat fast at the  thought of helping him, lightening his load even a little.
    "Father," she said, softly.
    Raeburn was the sort of a man who could not be startled, but he looked  up quickly, apparently returning from some speculative region with a  slight effort.
 He was the most practical of men, and yet for a minute he  felt as if he were living in a dream, for Erica stood beside him, pale  and beautiful, with a sort of heroic light about her whole face which  transformed her from a merry child to a high-souled woman.
 Instinctively  he rose to speak to her.
    "I will not disturb you for more than a minute, father," she said, "it  is only that I have thought of a way in which I think I could help you  if you would let me.
"    "Well, dear, what is it?" said Raeburn, still watching half dreamily the  exceeding beauty of the face before him.
 Yet an undefined sense of dread  chilled his heart.
 Was anything too hard or high for her to propose? He  listened without a word to her account of M.
 Noirol's Parisian scheme,  to her voluntary suggestion that she should go into exile for two years.
  At the end he merely put a brief question.
 "Are you ready to bear two  years of loneliness?"    "I am ready to help you," she said, with a little quiver in her voice  and a cloud of pain in her eyes.
    Raeburn turned away from her and began to pace up and down the little  room, his eyes not altogether free from tears, for, pachydermatous as he  was accounted by his enemies, this man was very tender over his child,  he could hardly endure to see her pain.
 Yet after all, though she had  given him a sharp pang, she had brought him happiness which any father  might envy.
 He came back to her, his stern face inexpressibly softened.
    "And I am ready to be helped, my child; it shall be as you say.
"    There was something in his voice and in the gentle acceptance of help  from one so strong and self-reliant which touched Erica more than any  praise or demonstrative thanks could have done.
 They were going to work  together, he had promised that she should fight side by side with him.
    "Lawsuits may ruin us," said Raeburn, "but, after all, the evil has a  way of helping out the good.
" He put his arm round her and kissed her.
  "You have taught me, little one, how powerless and weak are these petty  persecutions.
 They can only prick and sting us! Nothing can really hurt  us while we love the truth and love each other.
"    That was the happiest moment Erica had ever known, already her loss had  brought a rapturous gain.
    "I shall never go to sleep tonight," she said.
 "Let me help you with  your letters.
"    Raeburn demurred a little, but yielded to her entreaties, and for the  next two hours the father and daughter worked in silence.
 The bitterness  which had lurked in the earlier part of the pamphlet that Raeburn had in  hand was quite lacking in its close; the writer had somehow been lifted  into a higher, purer atmosphere, and if his pen flew less rapidly over  the paper, it at any rate wrote words which would long outlive the mere  overflow of an angry heart.
    Coming back to the world of realities at last somewhere in the small  hours, he found his fire out, a goodly pile of letters ready for  his signature, and his little amanuensis fast asleep in her chair.
  Reproaching himself for having allowed her to sit up, he took her in his  strong arms as though she had been a mere baby, and carried her up  to her room so gently that she never woke.
 The next morning she found  herself so swathed in plaids and rugs and blankets that she could hardly  move, and, in spite of a bad headache, could not help beginning the day  with a hearty laugh.
    Raeburn was not a man who ever let the grass grow under his feet, his  decisions were made with thought, but with very rapid thought, and his  action was always prompt.
 His case excited a good deal of attention; but  long before the newspapers had ceased to wage war either for or against  him, long before the weekly journals had ceased to teem with letters  relating to the lawsuit, he had formed his plans for the future.
 His  home was to be completely broken up, Erica was to go to Paris, his wife  was to live with his sister, Mrs. Craigie, and her son, Tom, who had  agreed to keep on the lodgings in Guilford Terrace, while for himself  he had mapped out such a programme of work as could only have been  undertaken by a man of "Titanic energy" and "Herculean strength,"  epithets which even the hostile press invariably bestowed on him.
 How  great the sacrifice was to him few people knew.
 As we have said before,  the world regarded him as a target, and would hardly have believed that  he was in reality a man of the gentlest tastes, as fond of his home as  any man in England, a faithful friend and a devoted father, and perhaps  all the more dependent on the sympathies of his own circle because of  the bitter hostility he encountered from other quarters.
 But he made his  plans resolutely, and said very little about them either one way or the  other, sometimes even checking Erica when she grumbled for him, or gave  vent to her indignation with regard to the defendant.
    "We work for freedom, little one," he used to say; "and it is an honor  to suffer in the cause of liberty.
"    "But every one says you will kill yourself with overwork," said Erica,  "and especially when you are in America.
"    '"They don't know what stuff I'm made of," said Raeburn; "and, even if  it should use me up, what then? It's better to wear out than to rust  out, as a wise man once remarked.
"    "Yes," said Erica, rather faintly.
    "But I've no intention of wearing out just yet," said Raeburn,  cheerfully.
 "You need not be afraid, little son Eric; and, if at the end  of those two years you do come back to find me gray and wrinkled, what  will that matter so long as we are free once more.
 There's a good time  coming; we'll have the coziest little home in London yet.
"    "With a garden for you to work in," said Erica, brightening up like a  child at the castle in the air.
 "And we'll keep lots of animals, and  never bother again about money all our lives.
"    Raeburn smiled at her ides of felicity--no cares, and plenty of dogs  and cats! He did not anticipate any haven of rest at the end of the two  years for himself.
 He knew that his life must be a series of conflicts  to the very end.
 Still he hoped for relief from the load of debt, and  looked forward to the reestablishment of his home.
    Brian Osmond heard of the plans before long, but he scarcely saw Erica;  the Christmas holidays began, and he no longer met her each afternoon  in Gower Street, while the time drew nearer and nearer for her departure  for Paris.
 At length, on the very last day, it chanced that they were  once more thrown together.
    Raeburn was a great lover of flowers, and he very often received  floral offerings from his followers.
 It so happened that some beautiful  hot-house flowers had been sent to him from a nursery garden one day in  January, and, unwilling to keep them all, he had suggested that Erica  should take some to the neighboring hospitals.
 Now there were two  hospitals in Guilford Square; Erica felt much more interested in the  children's hospital than in the one for grown-up people; but, wishing to  be impartial she arranged a basketful for each, and well pleased to have  anything to give, hastened on her errand.
 Much to her delight, her first  basket of flowers was not only accepted very gratefully, but the lady  superintendent took her over the hospital, and let her distribute the  flowers among the children.
 She was very fond of children, and was as  happy as she could be passing up and down among the little beds, while  her bright manner attracted the little ones, and made them unusually  affectionate and responsive.
    Happy at having been able to give them pleasure, and full of tender,  womanly thoughts, she crossed the square to another small hospital; she  was absorbed in pitiful, loving humanity, had forgotten altogether  that the world counted her as a heretic, and wholly unprepared for what  awaited her, she was shown into the visitors' room and asked to give her  name.
 Not only was Raeburn too notorious a name to pass muster, but the  head of the hospital knew Erica by sight, and had often met her out of  doors with her father.
 She was a stiff, narrow-minded, uncompromising  sort of person, and, in her own words was "determined to have no  fellowship with the works of darkness.
" How she could consider  bright-faced Erica, with her loving thought for others and her free  gift, a "work of darkness," it is hard to understand.
 She was not at all  disposed, however, to be under any sort of obligation to an atheist, and  the result of it was that after a three minutes' interview, Erica found  herself once more in the square, with her flowers still in her hand,  "declined WITHOUT thanks.
"    No one ever quite knew what the superintendent had said to her, but  apparently the rebuff had been very hard to bear.
 Not content with  declining any fellowship with the poor little "work of darkness," she  had gone on in accordance with the letter of the text to reprove her;  and Erica left the house with burning cheeks, and with a tumult of angry  feeling stirred up in her heart.
 She was far too angry to know or  care what she was doing; she walked down the quiet square in the very  opposite direction to "Persecution Alley," and might have walked on for  an indefinite time had not some one stopped her.
    "I was hoping to see you before you left," said a pleasant quiet voice  close by her.
 She looked up and saw Charles Osmond.
    Thus suddenly brought to a standstill, she became aware that she was  trembling from head to foot.
 A little delicate, sensitive thing, the  unsparing censure and the rude reception she had just met with had quite  upset her.
    Charles Osmond retained her hand in his strong clasp, and looked  questioningly into her bright, indignant eyes.
    "What is the matter, my child?" he asked.
    "I am only angry," said Erica, rather breathlessly; "hurt and angry  because one of your bigots has been rude to me.
"    "Come in and tell me all about it," said Charles Osmond; and there  was something so irresistible in his manner that Erica at once allowed  herself to be led into one of the tall, old-fashioned houses, and taken  into a comfortable and roomy study, the nicest room she had ever been  in.
 It was not luxurious; indeed the Turkey carpet was shabby and  the furniture well worn, but it was home-like, and warm and cheerful,  evidently a room which was dear to its owner.
 Charles Osmond made her  sit down in a capacious arm chair close to the fire.
    "Well, now, who was the bigot?" he said, in a voice that would have won  the confidence of a flint.
    Erica told as much of the story as she could bring herself to repeat,  quite enough to show Charles Osmond the terrible harm which may be  wrought by tactless modern Christianity.
 He looked down very sorrowfully  at the eager, expressive face of the speaker; it was at once very white  and very pink, for the child was sorely wounded as well as indignant.
  She was evidently, however, a little vexed with herself for feeling the  insult so keenly.
    "It is very stupid of me," she said laughing a little; "it is time I was  used to it; but I never can help shaking in this silly way when any one  is rude to us.
 Tom laughs at me, and says I am made on wire springs like  a twelfth-cake butterfly! But it is rather hard, isn't it, to be shut  out from everything, even from giving?"    "I think it is both hard and wrong," said Charles Osmond.
 "But we do not  all shut you out.
"    "No," said Erica.
 "You have always been kind, you are not a bit like  a Christian.
 Would you"--she hesitated a little--"would you take the  flowers instead?"    It was said with a shy grace inexpressibly winning.
 Charles Osmond was  touched and gratified.
    "They will be a great treat to us," he said.
 "My mother is very fond of  flowers.
 Will you come upstairs and see her? We shall find afternoon tea  going on, I expect.
"    So the rejected flowers found a resting place in the clergyman's house;  and Brian, coming in from his rounds, was greeted by a sight which  made his heart beat at double time.
 In the drawing room beside his  grandmother sat Erica, her little fur hat pushed back, her gloves off,  busily arranging Christmas roses and red camellias.
 Her anger had died  away, she was talking quite merrily.
 It seemed to Brian more like a  beautiful dream than a bit of every-day life, to have her sitting there  so naturally in his home; but the note of pain was struck before long.
    "I must go home," she said.
 "This is my last day, you know.
 I am going  to Paris tomorrow.
"    A sort of sadness seemed to fall on them at the words; only gentle Mrs.  Osmond said, cheerfully:    "You will come to see us again when you come back, will you not?"    And then, with the privilege of the aged, she drew down the young, fresh  face to hers and kissed it.
    "You will let me see you home," said Brian.
 "It is getting dark.
"    Erica laughingly protested that she was well used to taking care of  herself, but it ended in Brian's triumphing.
 So together they crossed  the quiet square.
 Erica chattered away merrily enough, but as they  reached the narrow entrance to Guilford Terrace a shadow stole over her  face.
    "Oh!" she exclaimed, "this is the last time I shall come home for two  whole years.
"    "You go for so long," said Brian, stifling a sigh.
 "You won't forget  your English friends?"    "Do you mean that you count yourself our friend?" asked Erica, smiling.
    "If you will let me.
"    "That is a funny word to use," she replied, laughing.
 "You see we are  treated as outlaws generally.
 I don't think any one ever said 'will you  let' to me before.
 This is our house; thank you for seeing me home.
"  Then with a roguish look in her eyes, she added demurely, but with a  slight emphasis on the last word, "Good bye, my friend.
"    Brian turned away sadly enough; but he had not gone far when he heard  flying footsteps, and looking back saw Erica once more.
    "Oh, I just came to know whether by any chance you want a kitten," she  said; "I have a real beauty which I want to find a nice home for.
"    Of course Brian wanted a kitten at once; one would have imagined by the  eagerness of his manner that he was devoted to the whole feline tribe.
    "Well, then, will you come in and see it?" said Erica.
 "He really is  a very nice kitten, and I shall go away much happier if I can see him  settled in life first.
"    She took him in, introduced him to her mother, and ran off in search of  the cat, returning in a few minutes with a very playful-looking tabby.
    "There he is," she said, putting the kitten on the table with an air of  pride.
 "I don't believe he has an equal in all London.
    "What do you call him?" asked Brian.
    "His name is St.
 Anthony," said Erica.
 "Oh, I hope, by the bye, you  won't object to that; it was no disrespect to St.
 Anthony at all, but  only that he always will go and preach to my gold fish.
 We'll make him  do it now to show you.
 Come along Tony, and give them a sermon, there's  a good little kit!"    She put him on a side table, and he at once rested his front paws on a  large glass bowl and peered down at the gold fish with great curiosity.
    "I believe he would have drowned himself sooner or later, like Gray's  cat, so I dare say it is a good thing for him to leave.
 You will be kind  to him, won't you?"    Brian promised that he should be well attended to, and, indeed there  was little doubt that St.
 Anthony would from that day forth be lapped  in luxury.
 He went away with his new master very contentedly, Erica  following them to the door with farewell injunctions.
    "And you'll be sure to butter his feet well or else he won't stay with  you.
 Good bye, dear Tony.
 Be a good little cat!"    Brian was pleased to have this token from his Undine, but at the same  time he could not help seeing that she cared much more about parting  with the kitten than about saying good bye to him.
 Well, it was  something to have that lucky St.
 Anthony, who had been fondled and  kissed.
 And after all it was Erica's very childishness and simplicity  which made her so dear to him.
    As soon as they were out of sight, Erica, with the thought of the  separation beginning to weigh upon her, went back to her mother.
 They  knew that this was the last quiet time they would have together for many  long months.
 But last days are not good days for talking.
 They spoke  very little.
 Every now and then Mrs. Raeburn would make some inquiry  about the packing or the journey, or would try to cheer the child by  speaking of the house they would have at the end of the two years.
 But  Erica was not to be comforted; a dull pain was gnawing at her heart,  and the present was not to be displaced by any visions of a golden  future.
 "If it were not for leaving you alone, mother, I shouldn't mind  so much," she said, in a choked voice.
 "But it seems to me that you have  the hardest part of all.
"    "Aunt Jean will be here, and Tom," said Mrs. Raeburn.
    "Aunt Jean is very kind," said Erica, doubtfully.
 "But she doesn't know  how to nurse people.
 Tom is the one hope, and he has promised always  to tell me the whole truth about you; so if you get worse, I shall come  home directly.
"    "You mustn't grudge me my share of the work," said Mrs. Raeburn.
 "It  would make me very miserable if I did hinder you or your father.
"    Erica sighed.
 "You and father are so dreadfully public-spirited! And yet,  oh, mother! What does the whole world matter to me if I think you are  uncomfortable, and wretched, and alone?"    "You will learn to think differently, dear, by and by," said her mother,  kissing the eager, troubled face.
 "And, when you fancy me lonely, you  can picture me instead as proud and happy in thinking of my brave little  daughter who has gone into exile of her own accord to help the cause of  truth and liberty.
"    They were inspiriting words, and they brought a glow to Erica's face;  she choked down her own personal pain.
 No religious martyr went through  the time of trial more bravely than Luke Raeburn's daughter lived  through the next four and twenty hours.
 She never forgot even the most  trivial incident of that day, it seemed burned in upon her brain.
 The  dreary waking on the dark winter morning, the hurried farewells to her  aunt and Tom, the last long embrace from her mother, the drive to the  station, her father's recognition on the platform, the rude staring and  ruder comments to which they were subjected, then the one supreme wrench  of parting, the look of pain in her father's face, the trembling of  his voice, the last long look as the train moved off, and the utter  loneliness of all that followed.
 Then came dimmer recollections, not  less real, but more confused; of a merry set of fellow passengers who  were going to enjoy themselves in the south of France; of a certain  little packet which her father had placed in her hand, and which proved  to be "Mill on Liberty;" of her eager perusal of the first two or three  chapters; of the many instances of the "tyranny of the majority" which  she had been able to produce, not without a certain satisfaction.
 And  afterward more vividly she could recall the last look at England, the  dreary arrival at Boulogne, the long weary railway journey, and the  friendly reception at Mme Lemercier's school.
 No one could deny that her  new life had been bravely begun.
        .
 Paris         But we wake in the young morning when the light is breaking       forth; And look out on its misty gleams, as if the moon were       full; And the Infinite around, seems but a larger kind of       earth Ensphering this, and measured by the self-same handy       rule.
  Hilda among the Broken Gods.
    Not unfrequently the most important years of a life, the years which  tell most on the character, are unmarked by any notable events.
 A  steady, orderly routine, a gradual progression, perseverance in hard  work, often do more to educate and form than a varied and eventful life.
  Erica's two years of exile were as monotonous and quiet as the life  of the secularist's daughter could possibly be.
 There came to her, of  course, from the distance the echoes of her father's strife; but she was  far removed from it all, and there was little to disturb her mind in the  quiet Parisian school.
 There is no need to dwell on her uneventful life,  and a very brief description of her surroundings will be sufficient to  show the sort of atmosphere in which she lived.
    The school was a large one, and consisted principally of French  provincial girls, sent to Paris to finish their education.
 Some of them  Erica liked exceedingly; every one of them was to her a curious and  interesting study.
 She liked to hear them talk about their home life,  and, above all things, to hear their simple, naive remarks about  religion.
 Of course she was on her honor not to enter into discussions  with them, and they regarded all English as heretics, and did not  trouble themselves to distinguish between the different grades.
 But  there was nothing to prevent her from observing and listening, and  with some wonder she used to hear discussions about the dresses for the  "Premiere Communion," remarks about the various services, or laments  over the confession papers.
 The girls went to confession once a month,  and there was always a day in which they had to prepare and write out  their misdemeanors.
 One day, a little, thin, delicate child from the  south of France came up to Erica with her confession in her hand.
    "Dear, good Erica," she said, wearily, "have the kindness to read this  and to correct my mistakes.
"    Erica took the little thing on her knee, and began to read the paper.
 It  was curiously spelled.
 Before very long she came to the sentence, "J'ai  trop mange.
"    "Why, Ninette," exclaimed Erica, "you hardly eat enough to feed a  sparrow; it is nonsense to put that.
"    "Ah, but it was a fast day," signed Ninette.
 "And I felt hungry, and did  really eat more than I need have.
"    Erica felt half angry and contemptuous, half amused, and could only hope  that the priest would see the pale, thin face of the little penitent,  and realize the ludicrousness of the confession.
    Another time all the girls had been to some special service; on their  return, she asked what it had been about.
    "Oh," remarked a bright-faced girl, "it was about the seven joys--or the  seven sorrows--of Mary.
"    "Do you mean to say you don't know whether it was very solemn or very  joyful?" asked Erica, astonished and amused.
    "I am really not sure," said the girl, with the most placid  good-tempered indifference.
    On the whole, it was scarcely to be wondered at that Erica was not  favorably impressed with Roman Catholicism.
    She was a great favorite with all the girls; but, though she was very  patient and persevering, she did not succeed in making any of them  fluent English speakers, and learned their language far better than they  learned hers.
 Her three special friends were not among the pupils, but  among the teachers.
 Dear old Mme.
 Lemercier, with her good-humored black  eyes, her kind, demonstrative ways, and her delightful stories about  the time of the war and the siege, was a friend worth having.
 So was her  husband, M.
 Lemercier the journalist.
 He was a little dried-up man, with  a fierce black mustache; he was sarcastic and witty, and he would  talk politics by the hour together to any one who would listen to him,  especially if they would now and then ask a pertinent and intelligent  question which gave him scope for an oration.
    Erica made a delightful listener, for she was always anxious to learn  and to understand, and before long she was quite AU FAIT, and understood  a great deal about that exceedingly complicated thing, the French  political system.
 M.
 Lemercier was a fiery, earnest little man, with  very strong convictions; he had been exiled as a communist but had now  returned, and was a very vigorous and impassioned writer in one of the  advanced Republican journals.
 He and his wife became very fond of Erica,  Mme.
 Lemercier loving her for her brightness and readiness to help,  and monsieur for her beauty and her quickness of perception.
 It was  surprising and gratifying to meet with a girl who, without being a femme  savante, was yet capable of understanding the difference between the  Extreme Left and the Left Center, and who took a real interest in what  was passing in the world.
    But Erica's greatest friend was a certain Fraulein Sonnenthal, the  German governess.
 She was a kind-eyed Hanoverian, homely and by no means  brilliantly clever, but there was something in her unselfishness and in  her unassuming humility that won Erica's heart.
 She never would hear a  word against the fraulein.
    "Why do you care so much for Fraulein Sonnenthal?" she was often asked.
  "She seems uninteresting and dull to us.
"    "I love her because she is so good," was Erica's invariable reply.
    She and the fraulein shared a bedroom, and many were the arguments they  had together.
 The effect of being separated from her own people was,  very naturally, to make Erica a more devoted secularist.
 She was  exceedingly enthusiastic for what she considered the truth and not  unfrequently grieved and shocked the Lutheran fraulein by the vehemence  of her statements.
 Very often they would argue far on into the night;  they never quarreled, however hot the dispute, but the fraulein often  had a sore time of it, for, naturally, Luke Raeburn's daughter was well  up in all the debatable points, and she had, moreover, a good deal of  her father's rapidity of thought and gift of speech.
 She was always  generous, however, and the fraulein had in some respects the advantage  of her, for they spoke in German.
    One scene in that little bedroom Erica never forgot.
 They had gone  to bed one Easter-eve, and had somehow fallen into a long and stormy  argument about the resurrection and the doctrine of immortality.
 Erica,  perhaps because she was conscious of the "weakness" she had confessed  to Brian Osmond, argued very warmly on the other side; the poor little  fraulein was grieved beyond measure, and defended her faith gallantly,  though, as she feared, very ineffectually.
 Her arguments seemed  altogether extinguished by Erica's remorseless logic; she was not nearly  so clever, and her very earnestness seemed to trip her up and make all  her sentences broken and incomplete.
 They discussed the subject till  Erica was hoarse, and at last from very weariness she fell asleep while  the Lutheran was giving her a long quotation from St.
 Paul.
    She slept for two or three hours; when she woke, the room was flooded  with silvery moonlight, the wooden cross which hung over the German's  bed stood out black and distinct, but the bed was empty.
 Erica looked  round the room uneasily, and saw a sight which she never forgot.
 The  fraulein was kneeling beside the window, and even the cold moonlight  could not chill or hide the wonderful brightness of her face.
 She was a  plain, ordinary little woman, but her face was absolutely transformed;  there was something so beautiful and yet so unusual in her expression  that Erica could not speak or move, but lay watching her almost  breathlessly.
 The spiritual world about which they had been speaking  must be very real indeed to Thekla Sonnenthal! Was it possible that  this was the work of delusion? While she mused, her friend rose, came  straight to her bedside, and bent over her with a look of such love and  tenderness that Erica, though not generally demonstrative, could not  resist throwing her arms round her neck.
    "Dear Sunnyvale! You look just like your name!" she exclaimed, "all  brightness and humility! What have you been doing to grow so like  Murillo's Madonna?"    "I thought you were asleep," said the fraulein.
 "Good night,  Herzolattchen, or rather good morning, for the Easter day has begun.
"    Perhaps Erica liked her all the better for saying nothing more definite,  but in the ordinary sense of the word she did not have a good night,  for long after Thekla Sonnenthal was asleep, and dreaming of her German  home, Luke Raeburn's daughter lay awake, thinking of the faith which  to some was such an intense reality.
 Had there been anything excited or  unreal about her companion's manner, she would not have thought  twice about it; but her tranquillity and sweetness seemed to her very  remarkable.
 Moreover, Fraulein Sonnenthal was strangely devoid of  imagination; she was a matter-of-fact little person, not at all a likely  subject for visions and delusions.
 Erica was perplexed.
 Once more there  came to her that uncomfortable question: "Supposing Christianity were  true?"    The moonlight paled and the Easter morn broke, and still she tossed to  and fro, haunted by doubts which would not let her sleep.
 But by and by  she returned to the one thing which was absolutely certain, namely, that  her German friend was lovable and to be loved, whatever her creed.
    And, since Erica's love was of the practical order, it prompted her  to get up early, dress noiselessly, and steal out of the room without  waking her companion; then, with all the church bells ringing and the  devout citizens hurrying to mass, she ran to the nearest flower stall,  spent one of her very few half-francs on the loveliest white rose to be  had, and carried it back as an Easter offering to the fraulein.
    It was fortunate in every way that Erica had the little German lady for  her friend, for she would often have fared badly without some one to  nurse and befriend her.
    She was very delicate, and worked far too hard; for, besides all her  work in the school, she was preparing for an English examination which  she had set her heart on trying as soon as she went home.
 Had it not  been for Fraulein Sonnenthal, she would more than once have thoroughly  overworked herself; and indeed as it was, the strain of that two years  told severely on her strength.
    But the time wore on rapidly, as very fully occupied time always does,  and Erica's list of days grew shorter and shorter, and the letters from  her mother were more and more full of plans for the life they would lead  when she came home.
 The two years would actually end in January; Erica  was, however, to stay in Paris till the following Easter, partly to  oblige Mme.
 Lemercier, partly because by that time her father hoped to  be in a great measure free from his embarrassments, able once more to  make a home for her.
        .
 What the New Year Brought         A voice grows with the growing years;       Earth, hushing down her bitter cry,       Looks upward from her graves, and hears,       "The Resurrection and the Life am I.
"         O love Divine,--whose constant beam       Shines on the eyes that will not see,       And waits to bless us, while we dream       Thou leavest us because we turn from Thee!         Nor bounds, nor clime, nor creed Thou know'st,       Wide as our need Thy favors fall;       The white wings of the Holy Ghost       Stoop, seen or unseen, o'er the heads of all.
  Whittier    It was the eve of the new year, and great excitement prevailed in the  Lemerciers' house.
 Many of the girls whose homes were at a distance had  remained at school for the short winter holiday, and on this particular  afternoon a number of them were clustered round the stove talking about  the festivities of the morrow and the presents they were likely to have.
    Erica, who was now a tall and very pretty girl of eighteen, was sitting  on the hearth rug with Ninette on her lap; she was in very high spirits,  and kept the little group in perpetual laughter, so much so indeed that  Fraulein Sonnenthal had more than once been obliged to interfere, and do  her best to quiet them.
    "How wild thou art, dear Erica?" she exclaimed.
 "What is it?"    "I am happy, that is all," said Erica.
 "You would be happy if the year  of freedom were just dawning for you.
 Three months more and I shall be  home.
"    She was like a child in her exultant happiness, far more child-like,  indeed, than the grave little Ninette whom she was nursing.
    "Thou art not dignified enough for a teacher," said the fraulein,  laughingly.
    "She is no teacher," cried the girls.
 "It is holiday time and she need  not talk that frightful English.
"    Erica made a laughing defense of her native tongue, and such a babel  ensued that the fraulein had to interfere again.
    "Liebe Erica! Thou art beside thyself! What has come to thee?"    "Only joy, dear Thekla, at the thought of the beautiful new year which  is coming," cried Erica.
 "Father would say I was 'fey,' and should pay  for all this fun with a bad headache or some misfortune.
 Come, give me  the French 'David Copperfield,' and let me read you how 'Barkis Veut  Bien,' and 'Mrs. Gummidge a Pense de l'Ancien.
'"    The reading was more exquisitely ludicrous to Erica herself than to her  hearers.
 Still the wit of Charles Dickens, even when translated,  called forth peals of laughter from the French girls, too.
 It was the  brightest, happiest little group imaginable; perhaps it was scarcely  wonderful that old Mme.
 Lemercier, when she came to break it up, should  find her eyes dim with tears.
    "My dear Erica--" she said, and broke off abruptly.
    Erica looked up with laughing eyes.
    "Don't scold, dear madame," she said, coaxingly.
 "We have been very  noisy; but it is New year's eve, and we are so happy.
"    "Dear child, it is not that," said madame.
 "I want to speak to you for a  minute; come with me, cherie.
"    Still Erica noticed nothing; did not detect the tone of pity, did not  wonder at the terms of endearment which were generally reserved for more  private use.
 She followed madame into the hall, still chattering gayly.
    "The 'David Copperfield' is for monsieur's present tomorrow," she said,  laughingly.
 "I knew he was too lazy to read it in English, so I got him  a translation.
"    "My dear," said madame, taking her hand, "try to be quiet a moment.
 I--I  have something to tell you.
 My poor little one, monsieur your father is  arrived--"    "Father! Father here!" exclaimed Erica, in a transport of delight.
  "Where is he, where? Oh, madame, why didn't you tell me sooner?"    Mme.
 Lemercier tried in vain to detain her, as with cheeks all glowing  with happiness and dancing eyes, she ran at full speed to the salon.
    "Father!" she cried, throwing open the door and running to meet him.
  Then suddenly she stood quite still as if petrified.
    Beside the crackling wood fire, his arms on the chimney piece, his face  hidden, stood a gray-haired man.
 He raised himself as she spoke.
 His  news was in his face; it was written all too plainly there.
    "Father!" gasped Erica in a voice which seemed altogether different from  the first exclamation, almost as if it belonged to a different person.
    Raeburn took her in his arms.
    "My child--my poor little Eric!" he said.
    She did not speak a word, but clung to him as though to keep herself  from falling.
 In one instant it seemed as though her whole world had  been wrecked, her life shattered.
 She could not even realize that  her father was still left to her, except in so far as the mere bodily  support was concerned.
 He was strong; she clung to him as in a hurricane  she would have clung to a rock.
    "Say it," she gasped, after a timeless silence, perhaps of minutes,  perhaps of hours, it might have been centuries for aught she knew.
 "Say  it in words.
"    She wanted to know everything, wanted to reduce this huge, overwhelming  sorrow to something intelligible.
 Surely in words it would not be so  awful--so limitless.
    And he said it, speaking in a low, repressed voice, yet very tenderly,  as if she had been a little child.
 She made a great effort to listen,  but the sentences only came to her disjointedly and as if from a great  distance.
 It had been very sudden--a two hours' illness, no very great  suffering.
 He had been lecturing at Birmingham--had been telegraphed  for--had been too late.
    Erica made a desperate effort to realize it all; at last she brought  down the measureless agony to actual words, repeating them over and over  to herself--"Mother is dead.
"    At length she had grasped the idea.
 Her heart seemed to die within her,  a strange blue shade passed over her face, her limbs stiffened.
 She  felt her father carry her to the window, was perfectly conscious of  everything, watched as in a dream, while he wrenched open the clumsy  fastening of the casement, heard the voices in the street below, heard,  too, in the distance the sound of church bells, was vaguely conscious of  relief as the cold air blew upon her.
    She was lying on a couch, and, if left to herself, might have lain there  for hours in that strange state of absolute prostration.
 But she was not  alone, and gradually she realized it.
 Very slowly the re-beginning of  life set in; the consciousness of her father's presence awakened her,  as it were, from her dream of unmitigated pain.
 She sat up, put her arms  round his neck, and kissed him, then for a minute let her aching head  rest on his shoulder.
 Presently, in a low but steady voice, she said:  "What would you like me to do, father?"    "To come home with me now, if you are able," he said; "tomorrow morning,  though, if you would rather wait, dear.
"    But the idea of waiting seemed intolerable to her.
 The very sound of the  word was hateful.
 Had she not waited two weary years, and this was the  end of it all? Any action, any present doing, however painful, but no  more waiting.
 No terrible pause in which more thoughts and, therefore,  more pain might grow.
 Outside in the passage they met Mme.
 Lemercier,  and presently Erica found herself surrounded by kind helpers, wondering  to find them all so tearful when her own eyes felt so hot and dry.
 They  were very good to her, but, separated from her father, her sorrow  again completely overwhelmed her; she could not then feel the slightest  gratitude to them or the slightest comfort from their sympathy.
 She lay  motionless on her little white bed, her eyes fixed on the wooden  cross on the opposite wall, or from time to time glancing at Fraulein  Sonnenthal, who, with little Ninette to help, was busily packing her  trunk.
 And all the while she said again and again the words which summed  up her sorrow: "Mother is dead! Mother is dead!"    After a time her eyes fell on her elaborately drawn paper of days.
  Every evening since her first arrival she had gone through the almost  religious ceremony of marking off the day; it had often been a great  consolation to her.
 The paper was much worn; the weeks and days yet to  be marked were few in number.
 She looked at it now, and if there can be  a "more" to absolute grief, an additional pang to unmitigated sorrow, it  came to her at the sight of that visible record of her long exile.
 She  snatched down the paper and tore it to pieces; then sunk back again,  pale and breathless.
 Fraulein Sonnenthal saw and understood.
 She came to  her, and kissed her.
    "Herzbluttchen," she said, almost in a whisper, and, after a moment's  pause: "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott.
"    Erica made an impatient gesture, and turned away her head.
    "Why does she choose this time of all others to tell me so," she thought  to herself.
 "Now, when I can't argue or even think! A sure tower! Could  a delusion make one feel that anything is sure but death at such a time  as this! Everything is gone--or going.
 Mother is dead!--mother is dead!  Yet she meant to be kind, poor Thekla, she didn't know it would hurt.
"    Mme.
 Lemercier came into the room with a cup of coffee and a brioche.
    "You have a long journey before you, my little one," she said; "you must  take this before you start.
"    Yes, there was the journey; that was a comfort.
 There was something  to be done, something hard and tiring--surely it would blunt her  perceptions.
 She started up with a strange sort of energy, put on her  hat and cloak, swallowed the food with an effort, helped to lock her  trunk, moved rapidly about the room, looking for any chance possession  which might have been left out.
 There was such terrible anguish in her  tearless eyes that little Ninette shrunk away from her in alarm.
 Mme.
  Lemercier, who in the time of the siege had seen great suffering, had  never seen anything like this; even Thekla Sonnenthal realized that for  the time she was beyond the reach of human comfort.
    Before long the farewells were over.
 Erica was once more alone with her  father, her cheeks wet with the tears of others, her own eyes still hot  and dry.
 They were to catch the four o'clock train; the afternoon was  dark, and already the streets and shops were lighted; Paris, ever bright  and gay, seemed tonight brighter and gayer than ever.
 She watched the  placid-looking passengers, the idle loungers at the cafes; did they know  what pain was? Did they know that death was sure? Presently she found  herself in a second-class carriage, wedged in between her father and a  heavy-featured priest; who diligently read a little dogs-eared breviary.
  Opposite was a meek, weasel-faced bourgeois, with a managing wife, who  ordered him about; then came a bushy-whiskered Englishman and a newly  married couple, while in the further corner, nearly hidden from view  by the burly priest, lurked a gentle-looking Sister of Mercy, and a  mischievous and fidgety school boy.
 She watched them all as in a dream  of pain.
 Presently the priest left off muttering and began to snore,  and sleep fell, too, upon the occupants of the opposite seat.
 The little  weasel-faced man looked most uncomfortable, for the Englishman used him  as a prop on one side and the managing wife nearly overwhelmed him  on the other; he slept fitfully, and always with the air of a martyr,  waking up every few minutes and vainly trying to shake off his burdens,  who invariably made stifled exclamations and sunk back again.
    "That would have been funny once," thought Erica to herself.
 "How I  should have laughed.
 Shall I always be like this all the rest of my  life, seeing what is ludicrous, yet with all the fun taken out of it?"    But her brain reeled at the thought of the "rest of life.
" The blank of  bereavement, terrible to all, was absolute and eternal to her, and  this was her first great sorrow.
 She had known pain, and privation, and  trouble and anxiety, but actual anguish never.
 Now it had come to her  suddenly, irrevocably, never to be either more or less; perhaps to be  fitted on as a garment as time wore on, and to become a natural part of  her life; but always to be the same, a blank often felt, always present,  till at length her end came and she too passed away into the great  Silence.
    Despair--the deprivation of all hope--is sometimes wild, but oftener  calm with a deathly calmness.
 Erica was absolutely still--she scarcely  moved or spoke during the long weary journey to Calais.
 Twice only  did she feel the slightest desire for any outward vent.
 At the Amiens  station the school boy in the corner, who had been growing more restless  and excited every hour, sprung from the carriage to greet a small crowd  of relations who were waiting to welcome him.
 She saw him rush to  his mother, heard a confused affectionate babel of inquiries,  congratulations, laughter.
 Oh! To think of that happy light-heartedness  and the contrast between it and her grief.
 The laughter seemed  positively to cut her; she could have screamed from sheer pain.
 And, as  if cruel contrasts were fated to confront her, no sooner had her father  established her in the cabin on board the steamer, than two bright  looking English girls settled themselves close by, and began chatting  merrily about the new year, and the novel beginning it would be on board  a Channel steamer.
 Erica tried to stop her ears that she might not hear  the discussion of all the forthcoming gayeties.
 "Lady Reedham's dance  on Thursday, our own, you know, next week," etc.
, etc.
 But she could not  shut out the sound of the merry voices, or that wounding laughter.
    Presently an exclamation made her look and listen.
    "Hark!" said one of her fellow passengers.
 "We shall start now; I  hear the clock striking twelve.
 A happy new year to you, Lily, and all  possible good fortune.
"    "Happy new year!" echoed from different corners of the cabin; the  little Sister of Mercy knelt down and told her beads, the rest of the  passengers talked, congratulated, laughed.
 Erica would have given  worlds to be able to cry, but she could not.
 The terrible mockery of her  surroundings was too great, however, to be borne; her heart seemed like  ice, her head like fire; with a sort of feverish strength she rushed out  of the cabin, stumbled up the companion, and ran as if by instinct to  that part of the deck where a tall, solitary figure stood up darkly in  the dim light.
    "It's too cold for you, my child," said Raeburn, turning round at her  approach.
    "Oh, father, let me stay with you," sobbed Erica, "I can't bear it  alone.
"    Perhaps he was glad to have her near him for his own sake, perhaps he  recognized the truth to which she unconsciously testified that human  nature does at times cry out for something other than self, stronger and  higher.
    He raised no more objections, they listened in silence till the sound  of the church bells died away in the distance, and then he found a more  sheltered seat and wrapped her up closely in his own plaid, and together  they began their new year.
 The first lull in Erica's pain came in that  midnight crossing; the heaving of the boat, the angry dashing of the  waves, the foam-laden wind, all seemed to relieve her.
 Above all there  was comfort in the strong protecting arm round her.
 Yet she was too  crushed and numb to be able to wish for anything but that the end might  come for her there, that together they might sink down into the painless  silence of death.
    Raeburn only spoke once throughout the passage; instinctively he knew  what was passing in Erica's mind.
 He spoke the only word of comfort  which he had to speak: a noble one, though just then very insufficient:    "There is work to be done.
"    Then came the dreary landing in the middle of the dark winter's night,  and presently they were again in a railway carriage, but this time  alone.
 Raeburn made her lie down, and himself fell asleep in the  opposite corner; he had been traveling uninterruptedly for twenty hours,  had received a shock which had tried him very greatly, now from sheer  exhaustion he slept.
 But Erica, to whom the grief was more new, could  not sleep.
 Every minute the pain of realization grew keener.
 Here she  was in England once more, this was the journey she had so often thought  of and planned.
 This was going home.
 Oh, the dreariness of the reality  when compared with those bright expectations.
 And yet it was neither  this thought nor the actual fact of her mother's death which first  brought the tears to her burning eyes.
    Wearily shifting her position, she looked across to the other side of  the carriage, and saw, as if in a picture, her father.
 Raeburn was a  comparatively young man, very little over forty; but his anxieties and  the almost incredible amount of hard work of the past two years had told  upon him, and had turned his hair gray.
 There was something in his  stern set face, in the strong man's reserved grief, in the pose of his  grand-looking head, dignified, even in exhaustion, that was strangely  pathetic.
 Erica scarcely seemed to realize that he was her father.
  It was more as if she were gazing at some scene on the stage, or on a  wonderfully graphic and heart-stirring picture.
 The pathos and sadness  of it took hold of her; she burst into a passion of tears, turned her  face from the light, and cried as if no power on earth could ever stop  her, her long-drawn sobs allowed to go unchecked since the noise of the  train made them inaudible.
 She was so little given to tears, as a rule,  that now they positively frightened her, nor could she understand how,  with a real and terrible grief for which she could not weep, the mere  pathetic sight should have brought down her tears like rain.
 But the  outburst brought relief with it, for it left her so exhausted that for  a brief half hour she slept, and awoke just before they reached London,  with such a frightful headache that the physical pain numbed the mental.
    "How soon shall we be--" home she would have said, but the word choked  her.
 "How soon shall we get there?" she asked faintly.
 She was so  ill, so weary, that the mere thought of being still again--even in the  death-visited home--was a relief, and she was really too much worn out  to feel very acutely while they drove through the familiar streets.
    At last, early in the cold, new year's morning, they were set down in  Guilford Square, at the grim entrance to Persecution Alley.
 She looked  round at the gray old houses with a shudder, then her father drew her  arm within his, and led her down the dreary little cul-de-sac.
 There  was the house, looking the same as ever, and there was Aunt Jean coming  forward to meet them, with a strange new tenderness in her voice and  look, and there was Tom in the background, seeming half shy and afraid  to meet her in her grief, and there, above all, was the one great  eternal void.
    To watch beside the dying must be anguish, and yet surely not such keen  anguish as to have missed the last moments, the last farewells, the last  chance of serving.
 For those who have to come back to the empty house,  the home which never can be home again, may God comfort them--no one  else can.
    Stillness, and food, and brief snatches of sleep somewhat restored  Erica.
 Late in the afternoon she was strong enough to go into her  mother's room, for that last look so inexpressibly painful to all, so  entirely void of hope or comfort to those who believe in no hereafter.
  Not even the peacefulness of death was there to give even a slight, a  momentary relief to her pain; she scarcely even recognized her mother.
  Was that, indeed, all that was left? That pale, rigid, utterly changed  face and form? Was that her mother? Could that once have been her  mother? Very often had she heard this great change wrought by death  referred to in discussions; she knew well the arguments which were  brought forward by the believers in immortality, the counter arguments  with which her father invariably met them, and which had always seemed  to her conclusive.
 But somehow that which seemed satisfactory in the  lecture hall did not answer in the room of death.
 Her whole being seemed  to flow out into one longing question: Might there not be a Beyond--an  Unseen? Was this world indeed only         "A place to stand and love in for an hour,       With darkness and the death-hour rounding it?"    She had slept in the afternoon, but at night, when all was still, she  could not sleep.
 The question still lurked in her mind; her sorrow and  loneliness grew almost unbearable.
 She thought if she could only make  herself cry again perhaps she might sleep, and she took down a book  about Giordano Bruno, and read the account of his martyrdom, an account  which always moved her very much.
 But tonight not even the description  of the valiant unshrinking martyr of Free-thought ascending the scaffold  to meet his doom could in the slightest degree affect her.
 She tried  another book, this time Dickens's "Tale of Two Cities.
" She had never  read the last two chapters without feeling a great desire to cry, but  tonight she read with perfect unconcern of Sydney Carton's wanderings  through Paris on the night before he gave himself up--read the last  marvelously written scene without the slightest emotion.
 It was  evidently no use to try anything else; she shut the book, put out her  candle, and once more lay down in the dark.
    Then she began to think of the words which had so persistently haunted  Sydney Carton: "I am the Resurrection and the Life.
" She, too, seemed  to be wandering about the Parisian streets, hearing these words over and  over again.
 She knew that it was Jesus of Nazareth who had said this.
  What an assertion it was for a man to make! It was not even "I BRING  the resurrection," or "I GIVE the resurrection," but "I AM the  Resurrection.
" And yet, according to her father, his humility had been  excessive, carried almost to a fault.
 Was he the most inconsistent man  that ever lived, or what was he? At last she thought she would get up  and see whether there was any qualifying context, and when and where he  had uttered this tremendous saying.
    Lighting her candle, she crept, a little shivering, white-robed figure,  round the book-lined room, scanning the titles on every shelf, but  bibles were too much in use in that house to be relegated to the attics,  she found only the least interesting and least serviceable of her  father's books.
 There was nothing for it but to go down to the study;  so wrapping herself up, for it was a freezing winter's night, she went  noiselessly downstairs, and soon found every possible facility for  Biblical research.
    A little baffled and even disappointed to find the words in that which  she regarded as the least authentic of the gospels, she still resolved  to read the account; she read it, indeed, in two or three translations,  and compared each closely with the others, but in all the words stood  out in uncompromising greatness of assertion.
 This man claimed to BE the  resurrection, of as Wyclif had it, "the agen risying and lyf.
"    And then poor Erica read on to the end of the story and was quite thrown  back upon herself by the account of the miracle which followed.
 It was  a beautiful story, she said to herself, poetically written, graphically  described, but as to believing it to be true, she could as soon have  accepted the "Midsummer Night's Dream" as having actually taken place.
    Shivering with cold she put the books back on their shelf, and stole  upstairs once more to bear her comfortless sorrow as best she could.
        .
 "Why Do You Believe It?"         Then the round of weary duties, cold and formal, came to       meet her, With the life within departed that had given them       each a soul; And her sick heart even slighted gentle words       that came to greet her, For grief spread its shadowy pinions       like a blight upon the whole.
 A.
 A.
 Proctor    The winter sunshine which glanced in a side-long, half-and-half way  into Persecution Alley, and struggled in at the closed blinds of Erica's  little attic, streamed unchecked into a far more cheerful room in  Guilford Square, and illumined a breakfast table, at which was seated  one occupant only, apparently making a late and rather hasty meal.
 He  was a man of about eight-and-twenty, and though he was not absolutely  good-looking, his face was one which people turned to look at again, not  so much because it was in any way striking as far as features went, but  because of an unusual luminousness which pervaded it.
 The eyes, which  were dark gray, were peculiarly expressive, and their softness, which  might to some have seemed a trifle unmasculine, was counterbalanced  by the straight, dark, noticeable eyebrows, as well as by a thoroughly  manly bearing and a general impression of unfailing energy which  characterized the whole man.
 His hair, short beard, and mustache were of  a deep nut-brown.
 He was of medium height and very muscular looking.
    On the whole it was as pleasant a face as you would often meet with, and  it was not to be wondered at that his old grandmother looked up pretty  frequently from her arm chair by the fire, and watched him with that  beautiful loving pride which in the aged never seems exaggerated and  very rarely misplaced.
    "You were out very late, were you not, Brian?" she observed, letting  her knitting needles rest for a minute, and scrutinizing the rather  weary-looking man.
    "Till half-past five this morning," he replied, in a somewhat  preoccupied voice.
    There was a sad look in his eyes, too, which his grandmother partly  understood.
 She knitted another round of her sock and then said:    "Have you seen Tom Craigie yet?"    "Yes, last night I came across him," replied Brian.
 "He told me she had  come home.
 They traveled by night and got in early yesterday morning.
"    "Poor little thing!" sighed old Mrs. Osmond.
 "What a home-coming it must  have been?"    "Grannie," said Brian, pushing back his chair and drawing nearer to the  fire "I want you to tell me what I ought to do.
 I have a message to her  from her mother, there was no one else to take it, you know, except the  landlady, and I suppose she did not like that.
 I want to know when I  might see her; one has no right to keep it back, and yet how am I to  know whether she is fit to bear it? I can't write it down, it won't  somehow go on to paper, yet I can hardly ask to see her.
"    "We cannot tell that the message might not comfort her," said Mrs.  Osmond.
 Then, after a few minutes' thought she added: "I think, Brian,  if I were you, I would write her a little note, tell her why you want to  see her, and let her fix her own time.
 You will leave it entirely in her  own hands in that way.
"    He mused for a minute, seemed satisfied with the suggestion, and  moving across to the writing table, began his first letter to his love.
  Apparently it was hard to write, for he wasted several sheets and much  time that he could ill afford.
 When it was at length finished, it ran as  follows:    "Dear Miss Raeburn,--I hardly like to ask to see you yet for fear you  should think me intrusive, but a message was entrusted to me on Tuesday  night which I dare not of myself keep back from you.
 Will you see me?  If you are able to, and will name the time which will suit you best, I  shall be very grateful.
 Forgive me for troubling you, and believe me,  Yours faithfully, Brian Osmond.
"    He sent it off a little doubtfully, by no means satisfied that he had  done a wise thing.
 But when he returned from his rounds later in the day  the reply set his fears at rest.
    It was written lengthways across a sheet of paper; the small delicate  writing was full of character, but betrayed great physical exhaustion.
    "It is good of you to think of us.
 Please come this afternoon if you are  able.
 Erica.
"    That very afternoon! Now that his wish was granted, now that he was  indeed to see her, Brian would have given worlds to have postponed the  meeting.
 He was well accustomed to visiting sorrow-stricken people, but  from meeting such sorrow as that in the Raeburns' house he shrunk back  feeling his insufficiency.
 Besides, what words were delicate enough to  convey all that had passed in that death scene? How could he dare to  attempt in speech all that the dying mother would fain have had conveyed  to her child? And then his own love! Would not that be the greatest  difficulty of all? Feeling her grief as he did, could he yet modify his  manner to suit that of a mere outsider--almost a stranger? He was very  diffident; though longing to see Erica, he would yet have given anything  to be able to transfer his work to his father.
 This, however, was of  course impossible.
    Strange though it might seem, he--the most unsuitable of all men in his  own eyes--was the man singled out to bear this message, to go to the  death-visited household.
 He went about his afternoon work in a sort of  steady, mechanical manner, the outward veil of his inward agitation.
  About four o'clock he was free to go to Guilford Terrace.
    He was shown into the little sitting room; it was the room in which  Mrs. Raeburn had died, and the mere sight of the outer surroundings, the  well-worn furniture, the book-lined walls made the whole scene vividly  present to him.
 The room was empty, there was a blazing fire but no  other light, for the blinds were down, and even the winter twilight shut  out.
 Brian sat down and waited.
 Presently the door opened, he looked up  and saw Erica approaching him.
 She was taller than she had been when he  last saw her, and now grief had given her a peculiar dignity which made  her much more like her father.
 Every shade of color had left her  face, her eyes wee full of a limitless pain, the eyelids were slightly  reddened, but apparently rather from sleeplessness than from tears, the  whole face was so altered that a mere casual acquaintance would hardly  have recognized it, except by the unchanged waves of short auburn hair  which still formed the setting as it were to a picture lovely even now.
  Only one thing was unchanged, and that was the frank, unconventional  manner.
 Even in her grief she could not be quite like other people.
    "It is very good of you to let me see you," said Brian, "you are sure  you are doing right; it will not be too much for you today.
"    "There is no great difference in says, I think," said Erica, sitting  down on a low chair beside the fire.
 "I do not very much believe in  degrees in this kind of grief.
 I do not see why it should be ever more  or ever less.
 Perhaps I am wrong, it is all new to me.
"    She spoke in a slow, steady, low-toned voice.
 There was an absolute  hopelessness about her whole aspect which was terrible to see.
 A  moment's pause followed, then, looking up at Brian, she fancied that she  read in his face, something of hesitation, of a consciousness that he  could ill express what he wished to say, and her innate courtesy made  her even now hasten to relieve him.
    "Don't be afraid of speaking," she said, a softer light coming into her  eyes.
 "I don't know why people shrink from meeting trouble.
 Even Tom  is half afraid of me.
 I am not changed, I am still Erica; can't you  understand how much I want every one now?    "People differ so much," said Brian, a little huskily, "and then when  one feels strongly words do not come easily.
"    "Do you think I would not rather have your sympathy than an oration  from any one else! You who were here to the end! You who did everything  for--for her.
 My father has told me very little, he was not able to, but  he told me of you, how helpful you were, how good, not like an outsider  at all!"    Evidently she clung to the comforting recollection that at least one  trustable, sympathetic person had been with her mother at the last.
  Brian could only say how little he had done, how much more he would fain  have done had it been possible.
    "I think you do comfort me by talking," said Erica.
 "And now I want you,  if you don't mind, to tell me all from the very first.
 I can't torture  my father by asking him, and I couldn't hear it from the landlady.
 But  you were here, you can tell me all.
 Don't be afraid of hurting me; can't  you understand, if the past were the only thing left to you, you would  want to know every tiniest detail!"    He looked searchingly into her eyes, he thought she was right.
 There  were no degrees to pain like hers! Besides, it was quite possible that  the lesser details of her mother's death might bring tears which would  relieve her.
 Very quietly, very reverently, he told her all that had  passed--she already knew that her mother had died from aneurism of the  heart--he told her how in the evening he had been summoned to her, and  from the first had known that it was hopeless, had been obliged to  tell her that the time for speech even was but short.
 He had ordered a  telegram to be sent to her father at Birmingham, but Mrs. Craigie and  Tom were out for the evening, and no one knew where they were to be  found.
 He and the landlady had been alone.
    "She spoke constantly of you," he continued.
 "The very last words she  said were these, 'Tell Erica that only love can keep from bitterness,  that love is stronger than the world's unkindness.
' Then, after a  minute's pause, she added, 'Be good to my little girl, promise to be  good to her.
' After that, speech became impossible, but I do not think  she suffered.
 Once she motioned to me to give her the frame off the  mantlepiece with your photograph; she looked at it and kept it near  her--she died with it in her hand.
"    Erica hid her face; that one trifling little incident was too much for  her, the tears rained down between her fingers.
 That it should have come  to that! No one whom she loved there at the last--but she had looked  at the photograph, had held it to the very end, the voiceless, useless  picture had been there, the real Erica had been laughing and talking  at Paris! Brian talked on slowly, soothingly.
 Presently he paused; then  Erica suddenly looked up, and dashing away her tears, said, in a voice  which was terrible in its mingled pain and indignation.
    "I might have been here! I might have been with her! It is the fault of  that wretched man who went bankrupt; the fault of the bigots who will  not treat us fairly--who ruin us!"    She sobbed with passionate pain, a vivid streak of crimson dyed her  cheek, contrasting strangely with the deathly whiteness of her brow.
    "Forgive me if I pain you," said Brian; "but have you forgotten the  message I gave you? 'It is only love that can keep from bitterness!'"    "Love!" cried Erica; she could have screamed it, if she had not been so  physically exhausted.
 "Do you mean I am to love our enemies?"    "It is only the love of all humanity that can keep from bitterness,"  said Brian.
    Erica began to think over his reply, and in thinking grew calm once  more.
 By and by she lifted up her face; it was pale again now, and  still, and perfectly hopeless.
    "I suppose you think that only Christians can love all humanity," she  said, a little coldly.
    "I should call all true lovers of humanity Christians," replied Brian,  "whether they are consciously followers of Christ or not.
"    She thought a little; then with a curiously hard look in her face, she  suddenly flashed round upon him with a question, much as her father  was in the habit of doing when an adversary had made some broad-hearted  statement which had baffled him.
    "Some of you give us a little more charity than others; but what do you  mean by Christianity? You ask us to believe what is incredible.
 WHY do  you believe in the resurrection: What reason have you for thinking it  true?"    She expected him to go into the evidence question, to quote the number  of Christ's appearances, to speak of the five hundred witnesses of whom  she was weary of hearing.
 Her mind was proof against all this; what  could be more probable than that a number of devoted followers should be  the victims of some optical delusion, especially when their minds were  disturbed by grief.
 Here was a miracle supported on one side by the  testimony of five hundred and odd spectators all longing to see their  late Master, and contradicted on the other side by common sense and the  experience of the remainder of the human race during thousands of years!  She looked full at Brian, a hard yet almost exultant expression in her  eyes, which spoke more plainly than words her perfect conviction:    "You can't set your evidences against my counter-evidences! You can't  logically maintain that a few uneducated men are to have more weight  than all the united experience of mankind.
"    Never would she so gladly have believed in the doctrine of immortality  as now, yet with characteristic honesty and resoluteness she set herself  into an attitude of rigid defense, lest through strong desire or mere  bodily weariness she should drift into the acceptance of what might be,  what indeed she considered to be error.
 But to her surprise, half to her  disappointment, Brian did not even mention the evidences.
 She had braced  herself up to withstand arguments drawn from the five hundred brothers,  but the preparation was useless.
    "I believe in the resurrection," said Brian, "because I cannot doubt  Jesus Christ.
 He is the most perfectly lovable and trustable being  I know, or can conceive of knowing.
 He said He should rise again, I  believe that He did rise.
 He was perfectly truthful, therefore He could  not mislead; He KNEW, therefore He could not be misled.
"    "We do not consider Him to be all that you assert," said Erica.
 "Nor do  His followers make one inclined to think that either He or His teaching  were so perfect as you try to make out.
 You are not so hard-hearted as  some of them--"    She broke off, seeing a look of pain on her companion's face.
 "Oh, what  am I saying!" she cried in a very different tone, "you who have done so  much--you who were always good to us--I did not indeed mean to hurt you,  it is your creed that I can't help hating, not you.
 You are our friend,  you said so long ago.
"    "Always," said Brian; "never doubt that.
"    "Then you must forgive me for having wounded you," said Erica, her whole  face softening.
 "You must remember how hard it all is, and that I am so  very, very miserable.
"    He would have given his life to bring her comfort, but he was not a very  great believer in words, and besides, he thought she had talked quite as  long as she ought.
    "I think," he said, "that, honestly acted out, the message intrusted to  me ought to comfort your misery.
"    "I can't act it out," she said.
    "You will begin to try," was Brian's answer; and then, with a very full  heart, he said goodbye and left his Undine sitting by the fire, with her  head resting on her hands, and the words of her mother's message echoing  in her ears.
 "It is only love that can keep from bitterness; love is  stronger than the world's unkindness.
"    Presently, not daring to dwell too much on that last scene which Brian  had described, she turned to his strange, unexpected reason for his  belief in the resurrection, and mused over the characteristics of his  ideal.
 Then she thought she would like to see again what her ideal man  had to say about his, and she got up and searched for a small book in  a limp red cover, labeled "Life of Jesus of Nazareth--Luke Raeburn.
" It  was more than two years since she had seen it; she read it through once  more.
 The style was vigorous, the veiled sarcasms were not unpleasant  to her, she detected no unfairness in the mode of treatment, the book  satisfied her, the conclusion arrived at seemed to her inevitable--Brian  Osmond's ideal was not perfect.
    With a sigh of utter weariness she shut the book and leaned back in her  chair with a still, white, hopeless face.
 Presently Friskarina sprung up  on her knee with a little sympathetic mew; she had been too miserable  as yet to notice even her favorite cat very much, now a scarcely  perceptible shade of relief came to her sadness, she stroked the soft  gray head.
 But scarcely had she spoken to her favorite, when the cat  suddenly turned away, sprung from her knee and trotted out of the room.
  It seemed like actual desertion, and Erica could ill bear it just then.
    "What, you too, Friskie," she said to herself, "are even you glad to  keep away from me?"    She hid her face in her hands; desolate and miserable as she had been  before, she now felt more completely alone.
    In a few minutes something warm touching her feet made her look up, and  with one bound Friskarina sprung into her lap, carrying in her mouth  a young kitten.
 She purred contentedly, looking first at her child and  then at her mistress, saying as plainly as if she had spoken:    "Will this comfort you?"    Erica stroked and kissed both cat and kitten, and for the first time  since her trouble a feeling of warmth came to her frozen heart.
        .
 Rose         A life of unalloyed content,       A life like that of land-locked seas.
       J.
 R.
 Lowell    "Elspeth, you really must tell me, I'm dying of curiosity, and I can see  by your face you know all about it! How is it that grandpapa's name is  in the papers when he has been dead all these years? I tell you I saw  it, a little paragraph in today's paper, headed, 'Mr. Luke Raeburn.
' Is  this another namesake who has something to do with him?"    The speaker was a tall, bright-looking girl of eighteen, a blue-eyed,  flaxen-haired blond, with a saucy little mouth, about which there now  lurked an expression of undisguised curiosity.
 Rose, for that was her  name, was something of a coax, and all her life long she had managed  to get her own way; she was an only child, and had been not a little  spoiled; but in spite of many faults she was lovable, and beneath her  outer shell of vanity and self-satisfaction there lay a sterling little  heart.
    Her companion, Elspeth, was a wrinkled old woman, whose smooth gray  hair was almost hidden by a huge mob-cap, which, in defiance of modern  custom, she wore tied under her chin.
 She had nursed Rose and her mother  before her and had now become more like a family friend than a servant.
    "Miss Rose," she replied, looking up from her work, "if you go on  chatter-magging away like this, there'll be no frock ready for you  tonight," and with a most uncommunicative air, the old woman turned  away, and gave a little impressive shake to the billowy mass of white  tarletan to which she was putting the finishing touches.
    "The white lilies just at the side," said Rose, her attention diverted  for a moment.
 "Won't it be lovely! The prettiest dress in the room, I'm  sure.
" Then, her curiosity returning, "But, Elspeth, I sha'nt enjoy the  dance a bit unless you tell me what Mr. Luke Raeburn has to do with us?  Listen, and I'll tell you how I found out.
 Papa brought the paper up  to Mamma, and said, 'Did you see this?' And then mamma read it, and the  color came all over her face, and she did not say a word, but went out  of the room pretty soon.
 And then I took up the paper, and looked at the  page she had been reading, and saw grandpapa's name.
"    "What was it about?" asked old Elspeth.
    "That's just what I couldn't understand; it was all about secularists.
  What are secularists? But it seems that this Luke Raeburn, whoever he  is, has lost his wife.
 While he was lecturing at Birmingham on the soul,  it is said, his wife died, and this paragraph said it seemed like a  judgment, which was rather cool, I think.
"    "Poor laddie!" signed old Elspeth.
    "Elspeth," cried Rose, "do you know who the man is?"    "Miss Rose," said the old woman severely, "in my young days there was a  saying that you'd do well to lay to heart, 'Ask no questions, and you'll  be told no stories.
'"    "It isn't your young days now, it's your old days, Elsie," said the  imperturbable Rose.
 "I will ask you questions as much as I please, and  you'll tell me what this mystery means, there's a dear old nurse! Have I  not a right to know about my own relations?"    "Oh, bairn, bairn! If it were anything you'd like to hear, but why  should you know what is all sad and gloomful? No, no, go to your balls,  and think of your fine dresses and gran' partners, though, for the  matter of that, it is but vanity of vanities--"    "Oh, if you're going to quote Ecclesiastes, I shall go!" said Rose,  pouting.
 "I wish that book wasn't in the Bible! I'm sure such an old  grumbler ought to have been in the Apocrypha.
"    Elspeth shook her head, and muttered something about judgment and  trouble.
 Rose began to be doubly curious.
    "Trouble, sadness, a mystery--perhaps a tragedy! Rose had read of such  things in books; were there such things actually in the family, and  she had never known of them? A few hours ago and she had been unable to  think of anything but her first ball, her new dress, her flowers; but  she was seized now with the most intense desire to fathom this mystery.
  That it bid fair to be a sad mystery only made her more eager and  curious.
 She was so young, so ignorant, there was still a halo of  romance about those unknown things, trouble and sadness.
    "Elspeth, you treat me like a child!" she exclaimed; "it's really too  bad of you.
"    "Maybe you're right, bairn," said the old nurse; "but it's no doing of  mine.
 But look here, Miss Rose, you be persuaded by me, go straight  to your mamma and ask her yourself.
 Maybe there is a doubt whether you  oughtn't to know, but there is no doubt that I mustn't tell you.
"    Rose hesitated, but presently her curiosity overpowered her reluctance.
    Mrs. Fane-Smith, or, as she had been called in her maiden days, Isabel  Raeburn, was remarkably like her daughter in so far as features  and coloring were concerned, but she was exceedingly unlike her in  character, for whereas Rose was vain and self-confident, and had a  decided will of her own, her mother was diffident and exaggeratedly  humble.
 She was a kind-hearted and a good woman, but she was in danger  of harassing herself with the question, "What will people say?"    She looked up apprehensively as her daughter came into the room.
  Rose felt sure she had been crying, her curiosity was still further  stimulated, and with all the persuasiveness at her command, she urged  her mother to tell her the meaning of the mysterious paragraph.
    "I am sorry you have asked me," said Mrs. Fane-Smith, "but, perhaps,  since you are no longer a child, you had better know.
 It is a sad story,  however, Rose, and I should not have chosen to tell it to you today of  all days.
"    "But I want to hear, mamma," said Rose, decidedly.
 "Please begin.
 Who is  this Mr. Raeburn?"    "He is my brother," said Mrs. Fane-Smith, with a little quiver in her  voice.
    "Your brother! My uncle!" cried Rose, in amazement.
    "Luke was the oldest of us," said Mrs. Fane-Smith, "then came Jean, and  I was the youngest of all, at least of those who lived.
"    "Then I have an aunt, too, an Aunt Jean?" exclaimed Rose.
    "You shall hear the whole story," replied her mother.
 She thought for a  minute, then in rather a low voice she began: "Luke and Jean were always  the clever ones, Luke especially; your grandfather had set his heart on  his being a clergyman, and you can fancy the grief it was to us when he  threw up the whole idea, and declared that he could never take Orders.
  He was only nineteen when he renounced religion altogether; he and my  father had a great dispute, and the end of it was that Luke was sent  away from home, and I never have seen him since.
 He has become a very  notorious infidel lecturer.
 Jean was very much unsettled by his change  of views, and I believe her real reason for marrying old Mr. Craigie  was that she had made him promise to let her see Luke again.
 She married  young and settled down in London, and when, in a few years, her husband  died, she too, renounced Christianity.
"    To tell the truth, Rose was not deeply interested in the story, it fell  a little flat after her expectations of a tragedy.
 It had, moreover, a  sort of missionary flavor, and she had till the last few months lived in  India, and had grown heartily tired of the details of mission work,  in which both her father and mother had been interested.
 Conversions,  relapses, heathenism, belief and unbelief were words which had sounded  so often in her ears that now they bored her; as they were the merest  words to her it could hardly be otherwise.
 But Rose's best point was her  loyalty to her own family, she had the "clan" feeling very strongly,  and she could not understand how her mother could have allowed such a  complete estrangement to grow up between her and her nearest relations.
    "Mamma," she said, quickly, "I should have gone to see Uncle Luke if I  had been you.
"    "It is impossible, dear," replied Mrs. Fane-Smith.
 "Your father would  not allow it for one thing, and then only think what people would say!  This is partly my reason for telling you, Rose; I want to put you upon  your guard.
 We heard little or nothing of your uncle when we were in  India, but you will find it very different here.
 He is one of the most  notorious men in England; you must never mention his name, never allude  to him, do you understand me?"    "Is he then so wicked?"    "My dear, consider what his teaching is, that is sufficient; I would  not for the whole world allow our Greyshot friends to guess that we  are connected with him in any way.
 It might ruin all your prospects in  life.
"    "Mamma," said Rose, "I don't think Mr. Raeburn will injure my  prospects--of course you mean prospects of marrying.
 If a man didn't  care enough for me to take me whether I am the niece of the worst man in  England or not, do you think I would accept him?"    There was an angry ring in her voice as she spoke, her little saucy  mouth looked almost grand.
 After a moment's pause, she added, more  quietly, but with all the force of the true woman's heart which lay  hidden beneath her silliness and frivolity, "Besides, mamma, is it quite  honest?"    "We are not bound to publish our family history to the world, Rose.
 If  any one asked me, of course I should tell the truth; if there was any  way of helping my brother or his child I would gladly serve them, even  though the world would look coldly on me for doing so; but while they  remain atheists how is it possible?"    "Then he has a child?"    "One only, I believe, a girl of about your own age.
"    "Oh, mamma, how I should like to know her!"    "My dear Rose, how can you speak of such a thing? You don't realize that  she is an atheist, has not even been baptized, poor little thing!"    "But she is my cousin, and she is a girl just like me," said Rose.
 "I  should like to know her very much.
 I wonder whether she has come out  yet.
 I wonder how she enjoyed her first ball.
"    "My dear! They are not in society.
"    "How dull! What does she do all day, I wonder?"    "I cannot tell, I wish you would not talk about her, Rose; I should not  wish you even to think about her, except, indeed, to mention her in your  prayers.
"    "Oh, I'd much rather have her here to stay," said Rose, with a little  mischievous gleam in her eyes.
    "Rose!"    "Why mamma, if she were a black unbeliever you would be delighted to  have her; it is only because she is white that you won't have anything  to do with her.
 You would have been as pleased as possible if I had made  friends with any of the ladies in the Zenanas.
"    Mrs. Fane-Smith looked uncomfortable, and murmured that that was a very  different question.
 Rose, seeing her advantage, made haste to follow it  up.
    "At any rate, mamma, you will write to Uncle Luke now that he is in  trouble, and you'll let me send a note to his daughter? Only think,  mamma, she has lost her mother so suddenly! Just think how wretched she  must be! Oh, mamma, dear, I can't think how she can bear it!" and Rose  threw her arms round her mother's neck.
 "I should die too if you were to  die! I'm sure I should.
"    Rose was very persuasive, Mrs. Fane-Smith's motherly heart was touched;  she sat down there and then, and for the first time since the summer day  when Luke Raeburn had been turned out of his father's house, she wrote  to her brother.
 Rose in the meantime had taken a piece of paper from her  mother's writing desk, and with a fat volume of sermons by way of a desk  was scribbling away as fast as she could.
 This was her letter:    "My dear cousin,--I don't know your name, and have only just heard  anything about you, and the first thing I heard was that you were in  dreadful trouble.
 I only write to send you my love, and to say how very  sorry I am for you.
 We only came to England in the autumn.
 I like it  very much.
 I am going to my first ball tonight, and expect to enjoy it  immensely.
 My dress is to be white tarle--Oh, dear! How horrid of me to  be writing like this to you.
 Please forgive me.
 I don't like to be so  happy when you are unhappy; but, you see, I have only just heard of  you, so it is a little difficult.
 With love, I remain, your affectionate  cousin, Rose Fane-Smith.
"    That evening, while Erica, with eyes dim with grief and weariness, was  poring over the books in her father's study, Rose was being initiated  into all the delights of the ballroom.
 She was in her glory.
 Everything  was new to her; she enjoyed dancing, she knew that she looked pretty,  knew that her dress was charming, knew that she was much admired, and  of course she liked it all.
 But the chaperons shook their heads; it was  whispered that Miss Fane-Smith was a terrible flirt, she had danced no  less than seven dances with Captain Golightly.
 If her mother erred by  thinking too much of what people said, perhaps Rose erred in exactly the  opposite way; at any rate, she managed to call down upon her silly but  innocent little head an immense amount of blame from the mothers and  elderly ladies.
    "A glorious moonlight night," said Captain Golightly.
 "What do you say,  Miss Fane-Smith? Shall we take a turn in the garden? Or are you afraid  of the cold?"    "Afraid! Oh, dear no," said Rose; "it's the very thing I should enjoy.
 I  suppose I must get my shawl, though; it is upstairs.
"    They were in the vestibule.
    "Have my ulster," said Captain Golightly.
 "Here it is, just handy, and  it will keep you much warmer.
"    Rose laughed and blushed, and allowed herself to be put into her  partner's coat, rather to the detriment of her billowy tarletan.
 After  a while they came back again from the dim garden to the brightly lighted  vestibule, and as ill luck would have it, chanced to encounter a stream  of people going into the supper room.
 Every one stared at the apparition  of Miss Fane-Smith in Captain Golightly's coat.
 With some difficulty  she struggled out of it, and with very hot cheeks sought shelter in the  ballroom.
    "How dreadfully they looked! Do you think it was wrong of me?" she half  whispered to her partner.
    "Oh, dear, no! Sensible and plucky, and everything delightful! You are  much too charming to be bound down to silly conventionalities.
 Come, let  us have this dance.
 I'm sure you are engaged to some one in the supper  room who can't deserve such a delightful partner.
 Let us have this TROIS  TEMPS, and hurl defiance at the Greyshot chaperons.
"    Rose laughed, and allowed herself to be borne off.
 She had been excited  before, now she was doubly excited, and Captain Golightly had the most  delicious step imaginable.
        .
 Hard at Work         Longing is God's fresh heavenward will       With our poor earthward striving;       We quench it that we may be still       Content with merely living;       But, would we learn that heart's full scope       Which we are hourly wronging,       Our lives must climb from hope to hope       And realize our longing.

 Lowell    Perhaps it was only natural that there should be that winter a good deal  of communication between the secularist's house in Guilford Terrace and  the clergyman's house in Guilford Square.
    From the first Raeburn had taken a great fancy to Charles Osmond, and  now that Brian had become so closely connected with the memory of their  sudden bereavement, and had made himself almost one of them by his  silent, unobtrusive sympathy, and by his numberless acts of delicate  considerateness, a tie was necessarily formed which promised to deepen  into one of those close friendships that sometimes exist between two  entire families.
    It was a bleak, chilly afternoon in March, when Charles Osmond,  returning from a long round of parish work, thought he would look in for  a few minutes at the Raeburns'; he had a proposal to make to Erica, some  fresh work which he thought might interest her.
 He rang the bell at the  now familiar door and was admitted; it carried him back to the day when  he had first called there and had been shown into the fire-lit room,  with the book-lined walls, and the pretty little girl curled up on the  rug, with her cat and her toasting fork.
 Time had brought many changes  since then.
 This evening he was again shown into the study, but this  time the gas was lighted, and there was no little girl upon the hearth  rug.
 Erica was sitting at her desk hard at work.
 Her face lighted up at  the sight of her visitor.
    "Every one is out except me," she said, more brightly than he had heard  her speak since her return.
 "Did you really come to see me.
 How good of  you.
"    "But you are busy?" said Charles Osmond, glancing at the papers on the  desk.
 "Press work?"    "Yes, my first article," said Erica, "it is just finished; but if you'll  excuse me for one minute, I ought to correct it; the office boy will  call for it directly.
"    "Don't hurry; I will wait and get warm in the meantime," said Charles  Osmond, establishing himself by the fire.
    There was a silence broken only by the sound of Erica's pen as she  crossed out a word or a line.
 Charles Osmond watched her and mused.
 This  beautiful girl, whose development he could trace now for more than two  years back, what would she grow into? Already she was writing in the  "Idol Breaker.
" He regretted it.
 Yet it was obviously the most natural  employment for her.
 He looked at her ever-changing face.
 She was  absorbed in her work, her expression varying with the sentences she  read; now there was a look of triumphant happiness as she came  to something which made her heart beat quickly; again, a shade of  dissatisfaction at the consciousness of her inability to express what  was in her mind.
 He could not help thinking that it was one of the  noblest faces he had ever seen, and now that the eyes were downcast it  was not so terribly sad; there was, moreover, for the first time since  her mother's death, a faint tinge of color in her cheeks.
 Before five  minutes could have passed, the bell rang again.
    "That is my boy," she exclaimed, and hastily blotting her sheets, she  rolled them up, gave them to the servant, closed her desk, and crossing  the room, knelt down in front of the fire to warm her hands, which were  stiff and chilly.
    "How rude I have been to you," she said, smiling a little; "I always  have been rude to you since the very first time we met.
"    "We were always frank with each other," said Charles Osmond; "I remember  you gave me your opinion as to bigots and Christians in the most  delightfully open way.
 So you have been writing your first article?"    "Yes," and she stretched herself as though she were rather tired and  cramped.
 "I have had a delicious afternoon.
 Yesterday I was in despair  about it, but today it just came--I wrote it straight off.
"    "And you are satisfied with it?"    "Satisfied? Oh, no! Is anybody ever satisfied? By the time it is in  print I shall want to alter every sixth line.
 Still, I dare say it will  say a little of what I want said?"    "Oh, you do want something said?"    "Of course!" she replied, a little indignantly.
 "If not, how could I  write.
"    "I quite agree with you," said Charles Osmond, "and you mean to take  this up as your vocation?"    "If I am thought worthy," said Erica, coloring a little.
    "I see you have high ideas of the art," said Charles Osmond; "and what  is your reason for taking it up?"    "First of all, though it sounds rather illogical," said Erica, "I write  because I MUST; there is something in me which will have its way.
 Then,  too, it is part of our creed that every one should do all in his power  to help on the cause, and of course, if only for my father's sake, it  would be my greatest pleasure.
 Then, last of all, I write because I must  earn my living.
"    "Good reasons all," said Charles Osmond.
 "But I don't feel sure that you  won't regret having written when you look back several years hence.
"    "Oh! I dare say it will all seem crude and ridiculous then, but one must  make a beginning," said Erica.
    "And are you sure you have thought out these great questions so  thoroughly and fairly that you are capable of teaching others about  them?"    "Ah! Now I see what you mean!" exclaimed Erica; "you think I write in  defense of atheism, or as an attacker of Christianity.
 I do nothing  of the kind; father would not allow me to, he would not think me old  enough.
 Oh! No, I am only to write the lighter articles which are needed  every now and then.
 Today I had a delightful subject--'Heroes--what are  they?'"    "Well, and what is your definition of a hero, I wonder; what are the  qualities you think absolutely necessary to make one?"    "I think I have only two absolutely necessary ones," said Erica; "but my  heroes must have these two, they must have brains and goodness.
"    "A tolerably sweeping definition," said Charles Osmond, laughing,  "almost equal to a friend of mine who wanted a wife, and said there were  only two things he would stipulate for--1,500 a year, and an angel.
 But  it brings us to another definition, you see.
 We shall agree as to the  brains, but how about goodness! What is your definition of that very  wide, not to say vague, term?"    "I don't think I can define it," she said; "but one knows it when one  sees it.
"    "Do you mean by it unselfishness, courage, truthfulness, or any other  virtue?"    "Oh, it isn't any one virtue, or even a parcel of virtues, it will not  go into words.
"    "It is then the nearest approach to some perfect ideal which is in your  mind?"    "I suppose it is," she said, slowly.
    "How did that ideal come into your mind?"    "I don't know; I suppose I got it by inheritance.
"    "From the original moneron?"    "You are laughing at me.
 I don't know how of course, but I have it,  which, as far as I can see, is all that matters.
"    "I am not sure of that," said Charles Osmond.
 "The explanation of that  ideal of goodness which more or less clearly exists in all our minds,  seems to me to rest only in the conviction that all are children of one  perfect Father.
 And I can give you our definition of goodness without  hesitation, it is summed up for us in one word--'Christlikeness.
'"    "I cannot see it; it seems to me all exaggerated," said Erica.
  "I believe it is only because people are educated to believe and  predisposed to think it all good and perfect that there are so many  Christians.
 You may say it is we who are prejudiced.
 If we are, I'm  sure you Christians have done enough to make us so! How could I, for  instance, be anything but an atheist? Shall I tell you the very first  thing I can remember?"    Her eyes were flashing with indignant light.
    "I was a little tiny child--only four years old--but there are some  scenes one never forgets.
 I can see it all as plainly as possible, the  room in a hotel, the very doll I was playing with.
 There was a great  noise in the street, trampling, hissing, hooting.
 I ran to the window,  an immense crowd was coming nearer and nearer, the street was black with  the throng, they were all shouting and yelling--'Down with the infidel!'  'Kill the atheist!' Then I saw my father, he was there strong and  fearless, one man against a thousand! I tell you I saw him, I can see  him now, fighting his way on single-handed, not one creature brave  enough to stand up for him.
 I saw him pushed, struck, spit upon, stoned.
  At last a great brick struck him on the head.
 I think I must have been  too sick or too angry to see any more after that.
 The next thing I  remember is lying on the floor sobbing, and hearing father come into the  room and say: 'Why, little son Eric, did you think they'd killed me?'  And he picked me up and let me sit on his knee, but there was blood on  his face, and as he kissed me it dropped upon my forehead.
 I tell you,  you Christians baptized me into atheism in my own father's blood.
 They  were Christians who stoned him, champions of religion, and they were  egged on by the clergy.
 Did I not hear it all then in my babyhood?  And it is true; it is all fact; ask anybody you like; I have not  exaggerated.
"    "My dear child, I know you have not," said Charles Osmond, putting his  strong hand upon hers.
 He could feel that she was all trembling with  indignation.
 Was it to be wondered at? "I remember those riots perfectly  well," he continued.
 "I think I felt and feel as indignant about them  as yourself.
 A fearful mistake was made--Mr. Raeburn was shamefully  treated.
 But, Erica"--it was the first time he had called her by her  name--"you who pride yourself upon fairness, you who make justice your  watchword must be careful not to let the wrong doing of a few Christians  prejudice you against Christianity.
 You say that we are all predisposed  to accept Christ; but candidly you must allow, I think, that you are  trebly prejudiced against the very name of Christian.
 A Christian almost  inevitably means to you only one of your father's mistaken persecutors.
"    "Yes, you are so much of an exception that I always forget you are  one," said Erica, smiling a little.
 "Yet you are not like one of  us--quite--you somehow stand alone, you are unlike any one I ever  met; you and Thekla Sonnenthal and your son make to me a sort of new  variety.
"    Charles Osmond laughed, and changed the subject.
 "You are busy with your  examination work, I suppose?" And the question led to a long talk about  books and lectures.
    In truth, Erica had plunged into work of all kinds, not merely from love  of it, but because she felt the absolute need of fresh interests, the  great danger of dwelling unduly on her sorrow.
 Then, too, she had just  grasped a new idea, an idea at once noble and inspiriting.
 Hitherto she  had thought of a happy future for herself, of a home free from troubles  and harassing cares.
 That was all over now, her golden dream had come  to an end, "Hope dead lives nevermore.
" The life she had pictured to  herself could never be, but her nature was too strong to be crushed by  the sorrow; physically the shock had weakened her far more than any one  knew, but, mentally, it had been a wonderful stimulant.
 She rose above  herself, above her trouble, and life began to mean something broader and  deeper than before.
    Hitherto her great desire had been to be free from care, and to be  happy; now the one important thing seemed not so much to be happy, as  to know.
 To learn herself, and to help others to learn, became her chief  object, and, with all the devotion of an earnest, high-souled nature,  she set herself to act out these convictions.
 She read hard, attended  lectures, and twice a week taught in the night school attached to the  Institute.
    Charles Osmond could not help smiling as she described her days to him.
  She still retained something of the childishness of an Undine, and as  they talked she had taken up her old position on the hearth rug, and  Friskarina had crept on to her knee.
 Here, undoubtedly, was one whom  ignorant people would stigmatize as "blue" or as a "femme savante;" they  would of course be quite wrong and inexpressively foolish to use such  terms, and yet there was, perhaps, something a little incongruous in  the two sides, as it were, of Erica's nature, the keen intellect and the  child-like devotion, the great love of learning and the intense love  of fun and humor.
 Charles Osmond had only once in all his long years of  experience met with a character which interested him so much.
    "After all," he said, when they had talked for some time, "I have never  told you that I came on a begging errand, and I half fear that you will  be too busy to undertake any more work.
"    Erica's face brightened at the word; was not work what she lived for?    "Oh! I am not too busy for anything!" she exclaimed.
 "I shall quote  Marcus Aurelius to you if you say I haven't time! What sort of work?"    "Only, when you can, to come to us in the afternoon and read a little to  my mother.
 Do you think you could? Her eyes are failing, and Brian and I  are hard at work all day; I am afraid she is very dull.
"    "I should like to come very much," said Erica, really pleased at the  suggestion.
 "What sort of books would Mrs. Osmond like?"    "Oh, anything! History, travels, science, or even novels, if you are not  above reading them!"    "I? Of course not," said Erica, laughing.
 "Don't you think we enjoy  them as much as other people? When there is time to read them, at least,  which isn't often.
"    Charles Osmond laughed.
    "Very well then, you have a wide field.
 From Carlyle to Miss Bird,  and from Ernst Haeckel to Charles Reade.
 I should make them into a big  sandwich if I were you.
"    He said goodbye, and left Erica still on the hearth rug, her face  brighter than it had been for months.
    "I like that man," she said to herself.
 "He's honest and thorough, and  good all through.
 Yet how in the world does he make himself believe in  his creed? Goodness, Christlikeness.
 He looked so grand, too, as he said  that.
 It is wonderful what a personal sort of devotion those three have  for their ideal.
"    She wandered away to recollections of Thekla Sonnenthal, and that  carried her back to the time of their last parting, and the recollection  of her sorrow.
 All at once the loneliness of the present was borne in  upon her overwhelmingly; she looked around the little room, the Ilkley  couch was pushed away into a corner, there was a pile of newspapers upon  it.
 A great sob escaped her.
 For a minute she pressed her hands  tightly together over her eyes, then she hurriedly opened a book on  "Electricity," and began to read as if for her life.
    She was roused in about an hour's time by a laughing exclamation.
 She  started, and looking up, saw her cousin Tom.
    "Talk about absorption, and brown studies!" he cried, "why, you eat  everything I ever saw.
 I've been looking at you for at least three  minutes.
"    Tom was now about nineteen; he had inherited the auburn coloring of the  Raeburns, but otherwise he was said to be much more like the Craigies.
  He was nice looking, but somewhat freckled, and though he was tall and  strongly built, he somehow betrayed that he had led a sedentary life and  looked, in fact, as if he wanted a training in gymnastics.
 For the  rest he was shrewd, business-like, good-natured, and at present very  conceited.
 He had been Erica's friend and playfellow as long as she  could remember; they were brother and sister in all but the name, for  they had lived within a stone's throw of each other all their lives, and  now shared the same house.
    "I never heard you come in," she said, smiling a little.
 "You must have  been very quiet.
"    "I don't believe you'd hear a salute fired in the next room if you were  reading, you little book worm! But look here; I've got a parody on the  chieftain that'll make you cry with laughing.
 You remember the smashed  windows at the meeting at Rilchester last week?"    Erica remembered well enough, she had felt sore and angry about it, and  the comments in the newspapers had not been consolatory.
 She had learned  to dread even the comic papers; but there was nothing spiteful in the  one which Tom produced that evening.
 It was headed:    Scotch song (Tune--"Twas within a mile of Edinboro'town")         "Twas within a hall of Rilchester town,       In the bleak spring-time of the year,       Luke Raeburn gave a lecture on the soul of man,       And found that it cost him dear.
       Windows all were smashed that day,       They said: 'The atheist can pay.
'       But Scottish Raeburn, frowning cried:       'Na, na, it winna do,       I canna, canna, winna, winna, munna pay for you.
'"    The parody ran on through the three verses of the song, the conclusion  was really witty, and there was no sting in it.
 Erica laughed over it as  she had not laughed for weeks.
 Tom, who had been trying unsuccessfully  to cheer her ever since her return, was quite relieved.
    "I believe the sixpence a day style suits you," he said.
 "But, I say,  isn't anything coming up? I'm as hungry as a hunter.
"    Their elders being away for a few days, Tom and Erica were amusing  themselves by trying to live on the rather strange diet of the man who  published his plan for living at the smallest possible cost.
 They were  already beginning to be rather weary of porridge, pea soup and lentils.
  This evening pea soup was in the ascendant, and Erica, tired with a long  afternoon's work, felt as if she could almost as soon have eaten Thames  mud.
    "Dear me," she said, "it never struck me, this is our Lenten penance!  Now, wouldn't any one looking in fancy we were poor Romanists without an  indulgence?"    "Certainly without any self-indulgence," said Tom, who never lost an  opportunity of making a bad pun.
    "It would be a great indulgence to stop eating," said Erica, sighing  over the soup yet to be swallowed.
    "Do you think it is more inspiriting to fast in order to save one's soul  than it is to pay the chieftain's debts? I wish I could honestly say,  like the little French girl in her confession: 'J'ai trop mang.
'"    Tom dearly loved that story, he was exceeding fond of getting choice  little anecdotes from various religious newspapers, especially those  which dealt in much abuse of the Church of Rome, and he retailed them  CON AMORE.
 Erica listened to several, and laughed a good deal over them.
    "I wonder, though, they don't see how they play into our hands by  putting in these things," she said after Tom had given her a description  of some ludicrous attack made by a ritualist on an evangelical.
 "I  should have thought they would have tried to agree whenever they could,  instead of which they seem almost as spiteful to each other as they are  to us.
"    "They'd know better if they'd more than a grain of sense between them,"  said Tom, sweepingly, "but they haven't; and as they're always playing  battledoor and shuttlecock with that, it isn't much good to either.
  Of course they play into our hands.
 I believe the spiteful ultra-high  paper, and the spiteful ultra-low paper do more to promote atheism than  the 'Idol-Breaker' itself.
"    "How dreadful it must be for men like Mr. Osmond, who see all round, and  yet can't stop what they must think the mischief.
 Mr. Osmond has been  here this afternoon.
"    "Ah, now, he's a stunning fellow, if you like," said Tom.
 "He's not one  of the pig-headed narrow-minded set.
 How he comes to be a parson I can't  make out.
"    "Well, you see, from their point of view it is the best thing to be; I  mean he gets plenty of scope for work.
 I fancy he feels as much obliged  to speak and teach as father does.
"    "Pity he's not on our side," said Tom; "they say he's a first-rate  speaker.
 But I'm afraid he is perfectly crazy on that point; he'll  never come over.
"    "I don't think we've a right to put the whole of his religiousness down  to a mania," said Erica.
 "Besides, he is not the sort of man to be even  a little mad, there's nothing the least fanatical about him.
"    "Call it delusion if you like it better.
 What's in a name? The thing  remains the same.
 A man can't believe what is utterly against reason  without becoming, as far as that particular belief is concerned,  unreasonable, beyond the pale of reason, therefore deluded, therefore  mad.
"    Erica looked perplexed; she did not think Tom's logic altogether good,  but she could not correct it.
 There was, however, a want of generosity  about the assertion which instantly appealed to her fine sense of honor.
    "I can't argue it out," she said at last, "but it doesn't seem to me  fair to put down what we can't understand in other people to madness; it  never seemed to me quite fair for Festus to accuse Paul of madness when  he really had made a splendid defense, and it doesn't seem fair that you  should accuse Mr. Osmond of being mad.
"    "Only on that one point," said Tom.
 "Just a little touched, you know.
  How else can you account for a man like that believing what he professes  to believe?"    "I don't know," said Erica, relapsing into perplexed silence.
    "Besides," continued Tom, "you cry out because I say they must be just a  little touched, but they accuse us of something far worse than madness,  they accuse us of absolute wickedness.
"    "Not all of them," said Erica.
    "The greater part," said Tom.
 "How often do you think the chieftain  meets with really fair treatment from the antagonists?"    Erica had nothing to say to this.
 The harshness and intolerance which  her father had constantly to encounter was the great grief of her life,  the perpetual source of indignation, her strongest argument against  Christianity.
    "Have you much to do tonight?" she asked, not anxious to stir up afresh  the revolt against the world's injustice which the merest touch would  set working within her.
 "I was thinking that, if there was time to  spare, we might go to see the professor; he has promised to show me some  experiments.
"    "Electricity?" Tom pricked up his ears.
 "Not half a bad idea.
 If you'll  help me we can polish off the letters in an hour or so, and be free by  eight o'clock.
"    They set to work, and between them disposed of the correspondence.
    It was a great relief to Erica after her long day's work to be out in  the cool evening air.
 The night was fine but very windy, indeed the  sudden gusts at the street corners made her glad to take Tom's arm.
  Once, as they rather slackened their speed, half baffled by the storm, a  sentence from a passer-by fell on their ears.
 The speaker looked like a  countryman.
    "Give me a good gas-burner with pipes and a meter that a honest man can  understand! Now this 'ere elective light I say it's not canny; I've no  belief in things o' that kind, it won't never--"    The rest of the speech died away in the distance.
 Tom and Erica laughed,  but the incident set Erica thinking.
 Here was a man who would not  believe what he could not understand, who wanted "pipes and a meter,"  and for want of comprehensible outward signs pooh-poohed the great new  discovery.
    "Tom," she said slowly, and with the manner of one who makes a very  unpleasant suggestion, reluctantly putting forward an unwelcome thought,  "suppose if, after all, we are like that man, and reject a grand  discovery because we don't know and are too ignorant to understand! Tom,  just suppose if, after all, Christianity should be true and we in the  wrong!"    "Just suppose if, after all, the earth should be a flat plain with the  sun moving round it!" replied Tom scornfully.
    They were walking down the Strand; he did not speak for some minutes, in  fact he was looking at the people who passed by them.
 For the first  time in his life a great contrast struck him.
 Disreputable vulgarity,  wickedness, and vice stared him in the face, then involuntarily he  turned to Erica and looked down at her scrutinizingly as he had never  looked before.
 She was evidently wrapped in thought but it was not the  intellect in her face which he thought of just then, though it was ever  noticeable, nor was it the actual beauty of feature which struck him, it  was rather an undefined consciousness that here was a purity which was  adorable.
 From that moment he became no longer a boy, but a man with  a high standard of womanhood.
 Instantly he thought with regret of his  scornful little speech--it was contemptible.
    "I beg your pardon," he said, abruptly, as if she had been following his  whole train of thought.
 "Of course one is bound to study the question  fairly, but we have done that, and all that remains for us is to live as  usefully as we can and as creditably to the cause as may be.
"    They had turned down one of the dingy little streets leading to the  river, and now stood outside Professor Gosse's door.
 Erica did not  reply.
 It was true she had heard arguments for and against Christianity  all her life, but had she ever studied it with strict impartiality? Had  she not always been strongly biased in favor of secularism? Had not Mr.  Osmond gone unpleasantly near the mark when he warned her against  being prejudiced by the wrong-doing of a few modern Christians against  Christianity itself! She was coming now for special instruction in  science from one who was best calculated to teach; she would not have  dreamed of asking instruction from one who was a disbeliever in science.
  Would the same apply in matters of religious belief? Was she bound  actually to ask instruction from Charles Osmond, for instance, even  though she believed that he taught error--harmful error? Yet who was to  be the judge of what was error, except by perfectly fair consideration  of both sides of the case.
 Had she been fair? What was perfect fairness?    But people must go on living, and must speak and act even though their  minds are in a chaos of doubts and questionings.
 They had reached  Professor Gosse's study, or as he himself called it, his workshop,  and Erica turned with relief to the verifiable results of scientific  inquiry.

 The Wheels Run Down         Great grace, as saith Sir Thomas More,       To him must needs be given,       Who heareth heresy, and leaves       The heretic to Heaven.
  Whittier.
    The clock in a neighboring church tower was just striking five on a warm  afternoon in June.
 The pillar box stood at the corner of Guilford Square  nearest the church, and on this particular afternoon there chanced to be  several people running at the last moment to post their letters.
 Among  others were Brian and Erica.
 Brian, with a great bundle of parish  notices, had just reached the box when running down the other side of  the square at full speed he saw his Undine carrying a bagful of letters.
  He had not met her for some weeks, for it happened to have been a busy  time with him, and though she had been very good in coming to read to  old Mrs. Osmond, he had always just missed her.
    "This is a funny meeting place," she exclaimed, rather breathlessly.
 "It  never struck me before what a truly national institution the post office  is--a place where people of all creeds and opinions can meet together,  and are actually treated alike!"    Brian smiled.
    "You have been very busy," he said, glancing at the innumerable  envelopes, which she was dropping as fast as might be into the narrow  receptacle.
 He could see that they were directed in her small, clear,  delicate handwriting.
    "And you, too," she said, looking at his diminished bundle.
 "Mine are  secularist circulars, and yours, I suppose, are the other kind of thing,  but you see the same pillar eats them up quite contentedly.
 The post  office is beautifully national, it sets a good example.
"    She spoke lightly, but there was a peculiar tone in her voice which  betrayed great weariness.
 It made Brian look at her more attentively  than he had yet done--less from a lover's point of view, more from a  doctor's.
 She was very pale.
 Though the running had brought a faint  color to her cheeks, her lips were white, her forehead almost deathly.
  He knew that she had never really been well since her mother's death,  but the change wrought within the last three weeks dismayed him; she was  the mere shadow of her former self.
    "This hot weather is trying you," he said.
    "Something is," she replied.
 "Work, or weather, or worry, or the three  combined.
"    "Come in and see my father," said Brian, "and be idle for a little time;  you will be writing more circulars if you go home.
"    "No, they are all done, and my examination is over, and there is nothing  special going on just now; I think that is why I feel so like breaking  down.
"    After a little more persuasion, she consented to go in and see Mr.  Osmond.
 The house always had a peculiarly restful feeling, and the mere  thought of rest was a relief to her; she would have liked the wheels of  life to stop for a little while, and there was rest in the mere change  of atmosphere.
 On the doorstep Brian encountered a patient, much to his  vexation; so he could only take Erica into the study, and go in search  of his father.
 He lingered however, just to tell him of his fears.
    "She looks perfectly worn out; you must find out what is wrong, father,  and make her promise to see some one.
"    His tone betrayed such anxiety that his father would not smile although  he was secretly amused at the task deputed to him.
 However, clergyman as  he was, he had a good deal of the doctor about him, and he had seen so  much of sickness and disease during his long years of hard work among  the poor that he was after all about as ready an observer and as good a  judge as Brian could have selected.
    Erica, leaning back in the great easy chair, which had been moved into  summer quarters beside the window, heard the slow soft step she had  learned to know so well, and before she had time to get up, found her  hand in Charles Osmond's strong clasp.
    "How comfortable your chair is," she said, smiling; "I believe I was  nearly asleep.
"    He looked at her attentively, but without appearing to study her face in  any way.
 She was very pale and there was an indefinable look of pain in  her eyes.
    "Any news of the examination?" he asked, sitting down opposite her.
    "No, it is too soon yet," she replied.
 "I thought I should have felt  so anxious about it, but do you know, now that it is over, I can't make  myself care a bit.
 If I have failed altogether, I don't believe I shall  mind very much.
"    "Too tired to care for anything?"    "Yes, I seem to have come to the end.
 I wish I were a watch, and could  run down and rest for a few days and be wound up again.
"    He smiled.
 "What have you been doing with yourself to get so tired?"    "Oh, nothing particular; it has been rather a long day.
 Let me see! In  the morning there were two delegates from Rilchester who had to be  kept in a good temper till my father was ready for them; then there was  father's bag to be packed, and a rush to get him off in time for  the morning express to Longstaff.
 Then I went to a lecture at South  Kensington, and then by train to Aldersgate Street to see Hazeldine's  wife, who is unconscionable enough to live at the top of one of the  model lodging houses.
 Then she told me of another of our people whose  child is ill, and they lived in another row of Compton buildings up  a hundred more steps, which left my back nearly broken.
 And the poor  little child was fearfully ill, and it is so dreadful to see pain you  can do nothing for; it has made me feel wretched ever since.
 Then--let  me think--oh, I got home and found Aunt Jean with a heap of circulars to  get off, and there was a great rush to get them ready by post time.
"    She paused; Charles Osmond withdrew his eyes from the careful scrutiny  of her face, and noticed the position she had taken up in his chair.
  She was leaning back with her arms resting on the arms of the chair;  not merely stretched out upon them, but rather as if she used them  for support.
 His eyes wandered back again to her face.
 After a short  silence, he spoke.
    "You have been feeling very tired lately; you have had unaccountable  pains flying about all over you, but specially your back has felt, as  you just said, somewhat 'broken.
' You have generally noticed this  when you have been walking, or bending over your desk writing for the  'Idol-Breaker.
'"    She laughed.
    "Now please don't turn into a clairvoyant; I shall begin to think you  uncanny; and, besides, it would be an argument for Tom when we quarrel  about you.
"    "Then my surmises are true?"    "Substitute first person singular for second plural, and it might have  come from my own lips," said Erica, smiling.
 "But please stop; I'm  afraid you will try to turn prophet next, and I'm sure you will prophesy  something horrid.
"    "It would need no very clear-sighted prophet to prophesy that you will  have to let your wheels run down for a little while.
"    "Do you mean that you think I shall die?" asked Erica, languidly.
 "It  wouldn't be at all convenient just now; father couldn't spare me.
 Do you  know," and her face brightened, "he is really beginning to use me a good  deal?"    "I didn't mean that I thought your wheels would run down in that way,"  said Charles Osmond, touched by the pathos of her words.
 "I may even be  wrong, but I think you will want a long rest, and I am quite sure you  mustn't lose a day before seeing a doctor.
 I should like my brother to  see you; Brian is only junior partner, you know.
"    "What, another Mr. Osmond! How muddled we shall get between you all!"  said Erica, laughing.
    "I should think that Brian might be Brian by this time," said Charles  Osmond; "that will dispose of one; and perhaps you would like to follow  the example of one of my servants, who, I hear, invariably speaks of me  as the 'dear rev.
'"    Erica laughed.
    "No, I shall call you my 'prophet,' though it is true you have begun by  being a prophet of evil! By the bye, you can not say again that I am not  impartial.
 What do you think Tom and I did last week?"    "Read the New Testament backward?"    "No, we went to a Holy Scripture Society meeting at Exeter Hall.
"    "Hope you were edified," said Charles Osmond, with a little twinkle in  his eye; but he sighed, nevertheless.
    "Well," said Erica, "it was rather curious to hear everything reversed,  and there was a good deal of fun altogether.
 They talked a great deal  about the numbers of bibles, testaments, and portions which had been  sent out.
 There was one man who spoke very broadly, and kept on speaking  of the 'PORTIONS,' and there was another whom we called the 'Great  Door,' because eight times in his speech he said that a great door had  been opened for them in Italy and other places.
 Altogether, I thought  them rather smug and self-satisfied, especially one man whose face shone  on the slightest provocation, and who remarked, in broad Lincolnshire,  that they had been 'aboondantly blessed.
' After his speech a little  short, sleek oily man got up, and talked about Providence.
 Apparently  it had been very kind to him, and he thought the other sort of thing  did best for those who got it.
 But there were one or two really good  speakers, and I dare say they were all in earnest.
 Still, you know, Tom  and I felt rather like fish out of water, and especially when they began  to sing, 'Oh, Bible, blessed Bible!' and a lady would make me share her  hymn book.
 Then, too, there was a collection, and the man made quite  a pause in front of us, and of course we couldn't give anything.
  Altogether, I felt rather horrid and hypocritical for being there at  all.
"    "Is that your only experience of one of our meetings?"    "Oh, no, father took me with him two or three times to Westminster Abbey  a good many years ago.
 We heard the dean; father admired him very  much.
 I like Westminster Abbey.
 It seems to belong a little to us, too,  because it is so national.
 And then it is so beautiful, and I liked  hearing the music.
 I wonder, though, that you are not little afraid of  having it so much in your worship.
 I remember hearing a beautiful anthem  there once, which just thrilled one all through.
 I wonder that you  don't fear that people should mistake that for what you call spiritual  fervor.
"    "I think, perhaps, there is a danger in any undue introduction of  externals, but any one whose spirit has ever been awakened will never  mistake the mere thrill of sensuous rapture for the quickening of the  spirit by the Unseen.
"    "You are talking riddles to me now!" said Erica; "but I feel sure that  some of the people who go to church regularly only like it because of  that appeal to the senses.
 I shall never forget going one afternoon into  Notre Dame with Mme.
 Lemercier.
 A flood of crimson and purple light  was shining in through the south transept windows.
 You could see the  white-robed priests and choristers--there was one boy with the most  perfect voice you can conceive.
 I don't know what they were singing,  something very sweet and mournful, and, as that one voice rang up into  the vaulted roof, I saw Mme.
 Lemercier fall down on her knees and pray  in a sort of rapture.
 Even I myself felt the tears come to my eyes, just  because of the loveliness, and because the blood in one's veins seemed  to bound.
 And then, still singing, the procession passed into the nave,  and the lovely voice grew more and more distant.
 It was a wonderful  effect; no doubt, the congregation thought they felt devout, but, if  so, then I too felt devout--quite as religious as they.
 Your spiritual  fervor seems to me to resolve itself into artistic effect produced by an  appeal to the senses and emotions.
"    "And I must repeat my riddle," said Charles Osmond, quietly.
 "No  awakened spirit could ever mistake the one for the other.
 It is  impossible! How impossible you will one day realize.
"    "One evil prophesy is enough for today!" said Erica laughing.
 "If I stay  any longer, you will be prophesying my acceptance of Christianity.
 No,  no, my father will be grieved enough if your first prediction comes  true, but, if I were to turn Christian, I think it would break his  heart!"    She rose to go, and Charles Osmond went with her to the door, extracting  a promise that she would discuss things with her aunt, and if she  approved send for Mr. Osmond at once.
 He watched her across the square,  then turning back into his study paced to and fro in deep thought.
  Erica's words rang in his ears.
 "If I were to turn Christian, I think  it would break his heart.
" How strangely this child was situated! How  almost impossible it seemed that she could ever in this world come to  the light! And yet the difficulty might perhaps be no hindrance to one  so beautifully sincere, so ready to endure anything and everything for  the sake of what she now considered truth.
 She had all her father's zeal  and self-devotion; surely the offering up of self, even in a  mistaken cause, must sooner or later lead to the Originator of all  self-sacrifice.
 Surely some of those who seem only to thwart God,  honestly deeming Christianity a mischievous delusion, are really acting  more in His spirit, unconsciously better doing His will than many who  openly declare themselves on His side! Yet, as Charles Osmond mused  over the past lives of Luke Raeburn and his daughter, and pictured  their probable future, a great grief filled his heart.
 They wee both so  lovable, so noble! That they should miss in a great measure the best of  life seemed such a grievous pity! The chances that either of them would  renounce atheism were, he could not but feel, infinitesimally small.
  Much smaller for the father than for the child.
    It was true, indeed, that she had never fairly grasped any real idea of  the character of Christ.
 He had once grasped it to a certain extent, and  had lost the perception of its beauty and truth.
 It was true also that  Erica's transparent sincerity, her quick perception of the beautiful  might help very greatly to overcome her deeply ingrained prejudices.
 But  even then what an agony--what a fearful struggle would lie before her;  "I think it would break his heart!" Charles Osmond felt his breath  come fast and hard at the mere thought of such a difference between the  father and daughter! Could human strength possibly be equal to such  a terrible trial? For these two were everything to each other.
 Erica  worshipped her father, and Raeburn's fatherhood was the truest, deepest,  tenderest part of his character.
 No, human strength could not do it,  but--    "I am; nyle ye drede!"    His eye fell on a little illuminated scroll above his mantelpiece,  Wycliff's rendering of Christ's reassuring words to the fearful  disciples.
 Yes, with the revelation of Himself, He would give the  strength, make it possible to dread nothing, not even the infliction  of grief to one's nearest and dearest.
 Much pain, much sacrifice there  would be in his service, but dread--never.
 The strength of the "I am,"  bade it forever cease.
 In that strength the weakest could conquer.
    But he had wondered on into a dim future, had pictured a struggle  which in all probability would not take place.
 Even were that the case,  however, he needed these words of assurance all the more himself.
 They  wove themselves into his reverie as he paced to an fro; they led him  further and further away from perplexed surmises as to the future of  Raeburn and Erica, but closer to their souls, because they took him  straight to the "God and father of all, who is above all, and through  all, and in all.
"    The next morning as he was preparing a sermon for the following Sunday,  there came a knock at his study door.
 His brother came in.
 He was a fine  looking man of two or three-and-fifty.
    "I can't stay," he said, "I've a long round, but I just looked in to  tell you about your little heretic.
"    Charles Osmond looked up anxiously.
    "It is as you thought," continued his brother.
 "Slight curvature of the  spine.
 She's a brave little thing; I don't wonder you are interested in  her.
"    "It means a long rest, I suppose?"    "Yes, I told her a year in a recumbent posture; for I fancy she is  one of those restless beings who will do nothing at all unless you are  pretty plain with them.
 It is possible that six or eight months may be  sufficient.
"    "How did she take it?"    "Oh, in the pluckiest way you can conceive! Tried to laugh at the  prospect, wanted me to measure her to see how much she grew in the time,  and said she should expect at least three inches to reward her.
"    "A Raeburn could hardly be deficient in courage.
 Luke Raeburn is without  exception the bravest man I ever met.
"    "And I'd back his daughter against any woman I know," said the doctor.
    He left the room, but the news he had brought caused a long pause in his  brother's sermon.
        .
 Raeburn's Homecoming         He is a man both loving and severe,       A tender heart, a will inflexible.
  Longfellow    Luke Raeburn had been lecturing in one of the large manufacturing towns.
  It was the hottest part of a sultry day in June.
 He was returning home,  and sat in a broiling third-class carriage reading a paper.
 Apparently  what he read was the reverse of gratifying for there was a look of  annoyance on his usually serene face; he was displeased with the report  of his lecture given in the local papers, it was calculated to mislead  very greatly.
    Other matters, too, were harassing him just then and he was, moreover,  paying the penalty of his two years' campaign, in which his almost  superhuman exertions and the privations he had voluntarily endured had  told severely upon his health.
 Possessed of a singularly well-regulated  mind, and having in an unusual degree the inestimable gift of common  sense, he nevertheless often failed to use it in his personal affairs.
  He had no idea of sparing himself, no idea of husbanding his  strength; this was indeed great, but he treated himself as if it were  inexhaustible.
 The months of trouble had turned his hair quite white; he  was now a more noticeable-looking man than ever.
    Not unfrequently he made friends with the men with whom he traveled; he  was always studying life from the workingman's point of view, and  there was such a charm in his genial manner and ready sympathy that he  invariably succeeded in drawing people out.
 But on this day he was not  in the humor for it; instead, he thought over the abusive article  and the mangled report in the "Longstaff Mercury," and debated within  himself whether it were worth an action for libel.
 His love of fighting  said yes, his common sense said no; and in the end common sense won the  day, but left him doubly depressed.
 He moved to the shady side of the  carriage and looked out of the window.
 He was a great lover of Nature,  and Nature was looking her loveliest just then.
 The trees, in all the  freshness of early June, lifted their foliage to the bluest of skies,  the meadows were golden with buttercups, the cattle grazed peacefully,  the hay fields waved unmown in the soft summer air, which, though  sparing no breath for the hot and dusty traveler, was yet strong enough  to sweep over the tall grasses in long, undulating waves that made them  shimmer in the sunlight.
    Raeburn's face grew serene once more; he had a very quick perception of  the beautiful.
 Presently he retired again behind a newspaper, this time  the "Daily Review," and again his brow grew stern, for there was bad  news from the seat of war; he read the account of a great battle, read  the numbers of his slain countrymen, and of those who had fallen on the  enemy's side.
 It was an unrighteous war, and his heart burned within  him at the thought of the inhuman havoc thus caused by a false ambition.
  Again, as if he were fated that day to be confronted with the dark side  of life, the papers gave a long account of a discovery made in some  charity school, where young children had been hideously ill-treated.
  Raeburn, who was the most fatherly of men, could hardly restrain the  expression of his righteous indignation.
 All this mismanagement, this  reckless waste of life, this shameful cruelty, was going on in what was  called "Free England.
" And here was he, a middle-aged man, and time  was passing on with frightful rapidity, and though he had never lost an  opportunity of lifting up his voice against oppression, how little had  he actually accomplished!    "So many worlds, so much to do, So little done, such things to be!"    That was the burden of the unuttered cry which filled his whole being.
  That was the point where his atheism often brought him to a noble  despair.
 But far from prompting him to repeat the maxim "Let us eat and  drink, for tomorrow we die!" it spurred him rather to a sort of fiery  energy, never satisfied with what it had accomplished.
 Neither the  dissatisfaction, however, nor even the despair ever made him feel the  need of any power above man.
 On the contrary, the unaccountable mystery  of pain and evil was his strongest argument against the existence of a  God.
 Upon that rock he had foundered as a mere boy, and no argument had  ever been able to reconvince him.
 Impatience of present ill had in this,  as in many other cases, proved the bane of his life.
    He would write and speak about these cases of injustice, he would hold  them up to the obloquy they so richly deserved.
    Scathing sentences already took shape in his brain, but deeper  investigation would be necessary before he could write anything.
 In  the meantime to cool himself, to bring himself into a judicial frame  of mind, he took a Hebrew book from his bag, and spent the rest of the  journey in hard study.
    Harassed, and tired, and out of spirits as he was, he nevertheless felt  a certain pleasurable sensation as he left St.
 Pancras, driving homeward  through the hot crowded streets.
 Erica would be waiting for him at home,  and he had a comparatively leisure afternoon.
 There was the meeting on  the Opium Trade at eight, but he might take her for a turn in one of the  parks beforehand.
 She had always been a companion to him since her very  babyhood, but now he was able to enjoy her companionship even more  than in the olden times.
 Her keen intellect, her ready sympathy, her  eagerness to learn, made her the perfection of a disciple, while not  unnaturally he delighted in tracing the many similarities of character  between himself and his child.
 Then, too, in his hard, argumentative,  fighting life it was an unspeakable relief to be able to retire every  now and then into a home which no outer storms could shake or disturb.
  Fond as he was of his sister, Mrs. Craigie, and Tom, they constituted  rather the innermost circle of his friends and followers; it was Erica  who made the HOME, though the others shared the house.
 It was to Erica's  pure child-like devotion that he invariably turned for comfort.
    Dismissing the cab at the corner of Guilford Square, he walked down  the dreary little passage, looking up at the window to see if she were  watching for him as usual.
 But today there was no expectant face; he  recollected, however, that it was Thursday, always a busy day with them.
    He opened the door with his latch key, and went in; still there was  no sound in the house; he half paused for an instant, thinking that he  should certainly hear her quick footsteps, the opening of a door, some  sign of welcome, but all was as silent as death.
 Half angry with himself  for having grown so expectant of that loving watch as to be seriously  apprehensive at its absence, he hastily put down his bag and walked  into the sitting room, his calm exterior belying a nameless fear at his  heart.
    What the French call expressively a "serrement de coeur" seized him  when he saw that Erica was indeed at home, but that she was lying on the  couch.
 She did not even spring up to greet him.
    "Is anything the matter, dear? Are you ill?" he asked, hurriedly  crossing the little room.
    "Oh, have you not seen Aunt Jean? She was going to meet you at St.
  Pancras," said Erica, her heart failing her a little at the prospect of  telling her own bad news.
 But the exceeding anxiety of her father's  face helped her to rise to the occasion.
 She laughed, and the laugh was  natural enough to reassure him.
    "It is nothing so very dreadful, and all this time you have never even  given me a kiss, father.
" She drew down the grand-looking white head,  and pressed her fair face to his.
 He sat down beside her.
    "Tell me, dear, what is wrong with you?" he repeated.
    "Well, I felt rather out of order, and they said I ought to see some  one, and it seems that my tiresome spine is getting crooked, and the  long and the short of it is that Mr. Doctor Osmond says I shall get  quite well again if I'm careful; but" she added, lightly, yet with the  gentleness of one who thinks merely of the hearer's point of view "I  shall have to be a passive verb for a year, and you will have to be my  very strong man Kwasind.
'"    "A year?" he exclaimed in dismay.
    "Brian half gave me hope that it might not be so long," said Erica, "if  I'm very good and careful, and of course I shall be both.
 I am only  sorry because it will make me very useless.
 I did hope I should never  have been a burden on you again, father.
"    "Don't talk of such a thing, my little son Eric," he said, very  tenderly.
 "Who should take care of you if not your own father? Besides,  if you never wrote another line for me, you would help me by just being  yourself.
 A burden!"    "Well, I've made you look as grave as half a dozen lawsuits," said  Erica, pretending to stroke the lines of care from his forehead.
 "I've  had the morning to ruminate over the prospect, and really now that you  know, it is not so very dreadful.
 A year will soon pass.
"    "I look to you, Eric," said her father, "to show the world that we  secularists know how to bear pain.
 You won't waste the year if you can  do it.
"    Her face lighted up.
    "It was like you to think of that!" she said; "that would indeed be  worth doing.
"    Still, do what she would, Erica could not talk him back to cheerfulness.
  He was terribly distressed at her news, and more so when he found that  she was suffering a good deal.
 He thought with a pang of the difference  of the reality to his expectations.
 No walk for them in the park that  evening, nor probably for many years to come.
 Yet he was ignorant of  these matters, perhaps he exaggerated the danger or the duration; he  would go across and see Brian Osmond at once.
    Left once more to herself, the color died out of Erica's cheeks; she lay  there pale and still, but her face was almost rigid with resoluteness.
    "I am not going to give way!" she thought to herself.
 "I won't shed a  single tear.
 Tears are wasteful luxuries, bad for body and mind.
 And yet  yet oh, it is hard just when I wanted to help father most! Just when  I wanted to keep him from being worried.
 And a whole year! How shall I  bear it, when even six hours has seemed half a life time! This is what  Thekla would call a cross, but I only call it my horrid, stupid, idiotic  old spine.
 Well, I must try to show them that Luke Raeburn's daughter  knows how to bear pain; I must be patient, however much I boil over in  private.
 Yet is it honest, I wonder, to keep a patient outside, while  inside you are all one big grumble? Rather Pharisaical outside of the  cup and platter; but it is all I shall be able to do, I'm sure.
 That is  where Mr. Osmond's Christianity would come in; I do believe that goes  right through his life, privatest thoughts and all.
 Odd, that a delusion  should have such power, and over such a man! There is Sir Michael  Cunningham, too, one of the greatest and best men in England, yet  a Christian! Great intellects and much study, and still they remain  Christians 'tis extraordinary.
 But a Christian would have the advantage  over me in a case like this.
 First of all, I suppose, they would feel  that they could serve their God as well on their backs as upright, while  all the help I shall be able to give the cause is dreadfully indirect  and problematical.
 Then certainly they would feel that they might be  getting ready for the next world where all wrong is, they believe, to be  set right, while I am only terribly hindered in getting ready for this  world a whole year without the chance of a lecture.
 And then they have  all kinds of nice theories about pain, discipline, and that sort of  thing, which no doubt make it more bearable, while to me it is just  the one unmitigated evil.
 But, oh! They don't know what pain means! For  there is no death to them no endless separation.
 What a delusion it is!  They ought to be happy enough.
 Oh, mother! mother!"    After all, what she really dreaded in her enforced pause was the leisure  for thought.
 She had plunged into work of all kinds, had half killed  herself with work, had tried to hold her despair at arms' length.
 But  now there was no help for it.
 She must rest, and the thoughts must come.
        .
 Losing One Friend to Gain Another         For toleration had its griefs,       And charity its trial.
  Whittier    "Well, Osmond, you got into hot water a few years ago for defending  Raeburn in public, and by this time you will find it not merely hot, but  up to boiling point.
 The fellow is more notorious than ever.
"    The speaker was one of Charles Osmond's college friends, a certain Mr.  Roberts, who had been abroad for a good many years, but, having returned  on account of his health, had for a few months been acting as curate to  his friend.
    "A man who works as indefatigably as Mr. Raeburn has done can hardly  avoid being noticed," replied Charles Osmond.
    "You speak as if you admired the fellow!"    "There is a good deal to admire in Mr. Raeburn.
 However greatly mistaken  he is, there is no doubt that he is a brave man, and an honest man.
"    "You can speak in such a way of a man who makes his living by speaking  and writing against God.
"    "I hope I can speak the truth of every man, whether his creed agrees  with mine or not.
"    "A man who grows rich on blasphemy! Who sows poison among the people and  reaps the harvest!" exclaimed Mr. Roberts.
    "That he teaches fearful error, I quite allow," said Charles Osmond,  "but it is the grossest injustice to say that he does it for gain.
 His  atheism brought him to the very brink of starvation some years ago.
 Even  now he is so crippled by the endless litigation he has had that he lives  in absolute penury.
"    "But that letter you sent to the 'Church Chronicle' was so uncalled for,  you put the comparison so broadly.
"    "I put it in plain 'English'," said Charles Osmond, "I merely said, as  I think, that he puts many of us to shame by his great devotion.
 The  letter was a reply to a very unfair article about the Rilchester riot;  it was absolutely necessary that some one should speak.
 I tell you,  Roberts, if you knew the man, you could not speak so bitterly of him.
  It is not true that he leads a selfish, easy-going life; he has spent  thousands and thousands of pounds in the defense of his cause.
 I don't  believe there is a man in England who has led a more self-denying life.
  It may be very uncomfortable news for us, but we've no right to shut our  ears to it.
 I wish that man could stir up an honest sense of shame in  every sleepy Christian in the country.
 I believe that, indeed, to be his  rightful mission.
 Raeburn is a grand text for a sermon which the  nation sorely needs.
 Here is a man who spends his whole strength in  propagating his so-called gospel of atheism.
 Do you spend your whole  strength in spreading the gospel of Christ? Here is a man, willing  to leave his home, willing to live without one single luxury, denying  himself all that is not necessary to actual health.
 Have you ever denied  yourself anything? Here is a man who spends his whole living all that he  has on what he believes to be the truth.
 What meager tithe do you bestow  upon the religion of which you speak so much? Here is a man who dares  to stand up alone in defense of what he holds true, a man who never  flinches.
 How far are you brave in the defense of your faith? Do you  never keep a prudent silence? Do you never 'howl with the wolves?'"    "Thank Heaven you are not in the pulpit!" ejaculated Mr. Roberts.
    "I wish those words could be sent through the length and breadth of the  land," said Charles Osmond.
    "No doubt Mr. Raeburn would thank you," said his friend, with a  sharp-edged smile.
 "It would be a nice little advertisement for him.
  Why, from a Church of England parson it would make his fortune! My dear  Osmond, you are the best fellow in the world, but don't you see that you  are playing into the enemy's hands.
"    "I am trying to speak the words that God has given me to speak," said  Charles Osmond.
 "The result I can well trust to Him.
 An uncomfortable  truth will never be popular.
 The words of our Lord Himself were not  popular; but they sunk into men's hearts and bore fruit, though He was  put to death as a blasphemer and a revolutionary.
"    "Well, at least then, if you must take up the cudgels in his defense, do  not dishonor the clerical profession by personal acquaintance with the  man.
 I hear that he has been seen actually in your house, that you are  even intimate with his family.
"    "Roberts, I didn't think our beliefs were so very different.
 In fact,  I used to think we were nearer to each other on these points than most  men.
 Surely we both own the universal Fatherhood of God?"    "Of course, of course," said Mr. Roberts, quickly.
    "And owning that, we cannot help owning the universal brotherhood  of men.
 Why should you then cut yourself off from your brother, Luke  Raeburn?"    "He's no brother of mine!" said Mr. Roberts, in a tone of disgust.
    Charles Osmond smiled.
    "We do not choose our brothers, we have no voice in the growth of the  family.
 There they are.
"    "But the man says there is no God.
"    "Excuse me, he has never said that.
 What he says is, that the word God  conveys no meaning to him.
 If you think that the best way to show your  belief in the All-Father and your love to all His children lies in  refusing so much as to touch those who don't know Him, you are of course  justified in shunning every atheist or agnostic in the world.
 But I do  not think that the best way.
 It was not Christ's way.
 Therefore, I hail  every possible opportunity of meeting Mr. Raeburn or his colleagues, try  to find all the points we have in common, try as far as possible to meet  them on their own ground.
"    "And the result will be that people will call you an atheist yourself!"  broke in Mr. Roberts.
    "That would not greatly matter," said Charles Osmond.
 "It would be a  mere sting for the moment.
 It is not what men call us that we have to  consider, but how we are fulfilling the work God has given us to do.
"    "'Pon my life, it makes me feel sick to hear you talk like this about  that miserable Raeburn!" exclaimed Mr. Roberts, hotly.
 "I tell you,  Osmond, that you are ruining your reputation, losing all chance of  preferment, just because of this mistaken zeal.
 It makes me furious  to think that such a man as you should suffer for such a creature as  Raeburn.
"    "Have you forgotten that such creatures as you and I and Luke Raeburn  had such a Saviour as Jesus Christ? Come, Roberts, in your heart you  know you agree with me.
 If one is indeed our Father, then indeed we are  all brethren.
"    "I do not hold with you!" retorted Mr. Roberts, the more angrily because  he had really hoped to convince his friend.
 "I wouldn't sit in the same  room with the fellow if you offered me the richest living in England.
 I  wouldn't shake hands with him to be made an archbishop.
 I wouldn't touch  him with a pair of tongs.
"    "Even less charitable than St.
 Dunstan to the devil," said Charles  Osmond, smiling a little, but sadly.
 "Except in that old legend,  however, I don't think Christianity ever mentions tongs.
 If you can't  love your enemies, and pray for them, and hold out a brotherly hand to  them, perhaps it were indeed better to hold aloof and keep as quiet as  you can.
"    "It is clearly impossible for us to work together any longer, Osmond,"  said Mr. Roberts, rising.
 "I am sorry that such a cause should separate  us, but if you will persist in visiting an outcast of society, a  professed atheist, the most bitter enemy of our church, I cannot allow  my name to be associated with yours it is impossible that I should hold  office under you.
"    So the two friends parted.
    Charles Osmond was human, and almost inevitably a sort of reaction  began in his mind the instant he was alone.
 He had lost one of his best  friends, he knew as well as possible that they could never be on  the same footing as before.
 He had, moreover, lost in him a valuable  co-worker.
 Then, too, it was true enough that his defense of Raeburn was  bringing him into great disfavor with the religious world, and he was a  sensitive and naturally a proud man, who found blame, and reproach,  and contemptuous disapproval very hard to bear.
 Years of hard fighting,  years of patient imitation of Christ had wonderfully ennobled him, but  he had not yet attained to the sublime humility which, being free from  all thought of self, cares nothing, scarcely even pauses to think of  the world's judgment, too absorbed in the work of the Highest to have  leisure for thought of the lowest, too full of love for the race to have  love to spare for self.
 To this ideal he was struggling, but he had not  yet reached it, and the thought of his own reputation, his own feelings  would creep in.
 He was not a selfishly ambitious man, but every one who  is conscious of ability, every one who feels within him energies lying  fallow for want of opportunity, must be ambitious for a larger sphere of  work.
 Just as he was beginning to dare to allow himself the hope of some  change in his work, some wider field, just as he was growing sure enough  of himself to dare to accept any greater work which might have been  offered to him, he must, by bringing himself into evil repute, lose  every chance of preferment.
 And for what? For attempting to obtain a  just judgment for the enemy of his faith; for holding out a brotherly  hand to a man who might very probably not care to take it; for  consorting with those who would at best regard him as an amiable  fanatic.
 Was this worth all it would cost? Could the exceedingly  problematical gain make up for the absolutely certain loss?    He took up the day's newspaper.
 His eye was at once attracted to a  paragraph headed: "Mr. Raeburn at Longstaff.
" The report, sent from  the same source as the report in the "Longstaff Mercury," which had so  greatly displeased Raeburn that morning, struck Charles Osmond in a most  unfavorable light.
 This bitter opponent of Christianity, this unsparing  denouncer of all that he held most sacred, THIS was the man for whom  he was sacrificing friendship, reputation, advancement.
 A feeling of  absolute disgust rose within him.
 For a moment the thought came: "I  can't have any more to do with the man.
"    But he was too honest not to detect almost at once his own Pharisaical,  un-Christlike spirit.
    "Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things  of others.
 Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.
"    He had been selfishly consulting his own happiness, his own ease.
 Worse  still, he, of all men in the world, had dared to set himself up as too  virtuous forsooth to have anything to do with an atheist.
 Was that  the mind which was in Christ? Was He a strait-laced, self-righteous  Pharisee, too good, too religious to have anything to say to those  who disagreed with Him? Did He not live and die for those who are yet  enemies to God? Was not the work of reconciliation the work he came for?  Did He calculate the loss to Himself, the risk of failure? Ah, no, those  who would imitate God must first give as a free gift, without thought  of self, perfect love to all, perfect justice through that love, or else  they are not like the Father who "maketh His sun to shine on the evil  and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
"    Charles Osmond paced to and fro, the look of trouble gradually passing  from his face.
 Presently he paused beside the open window; it looked  upon the little back garden, a tiny strip of ground, indeed, but just  now bright with sunshine and fresh with the beauty of early summer.
 The  sunshine seemed to steal into his heart as he prayed.
    "All-Father, drive out my selfish cowardice, my self-righteous conceit.
  Give me Thy spirit of perfect love to all, give me Thy pure hatred of  sin.
 Melt my coldness with Thy burning charity, and if it be possible  make me fit to be Luke Raeburn's friend.
"    While he still stood by the window a visitor was announced.
 He had been  too much absorbed to catch the name, but it seemed the most natural  thing that on turning round he should find himself face to face with the  prophet of atheism.
    There he stood, a splendid specimen of humanity; every line in his  rugged Scottish face bespoke a character of extraordinary force, but the  eyes which in public Charles Osmond had seen flashing with the fire  of the man's enthusiasm, or gleaming with a cold metallic light which  indicated exactly his steely endurance of ill treatment, were now  softened and deepened by sadness.
 His heart went out to him.
 Already  he loved the man, only hitherto the world's opinions had crept into his  heart between each meeting, and had paralyzed the free God-like love.
  But it was to do so no longer.
 That afternoon he had dealt it a final  blow, there was no more any room for it to rear its fair-speaking  form, no longer should its veiled selfishness, its so-called virtuous  indignation turn him into a Pharisaical judge.
    He received him with a hand shake which conveyed to Raeburn much of the  warmth, the reality, the friendliness of the man.
 He had always liked  Charles Osmond, but he had generally met him either in public, or when  he was harassed and preoccupied.
 Now, when he was at leisure, when, too,  he was in great trouble, he instinctively perceived that Osmond had in a  rare degree the broad-hearted sympathy which he was just now in need of.
  From that minute a life-long friendship sprung up between the two men.
    "I came really to see your son," said Raeburn, "but they tell me he is  out.
 I wish to know the whole truth about Erica.
" It was not his way to  speak very much where he felt deeply, and Charles Osmond could detect  all the deep anxiety, the half-indulged hope which lay hidden behind the  strong reserved exterior.
 He had heard enough of the case to be able to  satisfy him, to assure him that there was no danger, that all must  be left to time and patience and careful observance of the doctor's  regulations.
 Raeburn sighed with relief at the repeated assurance that  there was no danger, that recovery was only a question of time.
 Death  had so recently visited his home that a grisly fear had taken possession  of his heart.
 Once free of that, he could speak almost cheerfully of the  lesser evil.
    "It will be a great trial to her, such absolute imprisonment; she  is never happy unless she is hard at work.
 But she is brave and  strong-willed.
 Will you look in and see her when you can?"    "Certainly," said Charles Osmond.
 "We must do our best to keep up her  spirits.
"    "Yes, luckily she is a great reader, otherwise such a long rest would be  intolerable, I should fancy.
"    "You do not object to my coming to see her?" said Charles Osmond,  looking full into his companion's eyes.
 "You know that we discuss  religious questions pretty freely.
"    "Religious questions always are freely discussed in my house," said  Raeburn.
 "It will be the greatest advantage to her to have to turn  things well over in her mind.
 Besides, we always make a point of  studying our adversaries' case even more closely than our own, and, if  she has a chance of doing it personally as well as through books, all  the better.
"    "But supposing that such an unlikely thing were to happen as that she  should see reason to change her present views? Supposing, if you can  suppose anything so unlikely, she should ever in future years come to  believe in Christianity?"    Raeburn smiled, not quite pleasantly.
    "It is as you say such a very remote contingency!" He paused, grew  grave, then continued with all his native nobility: "Yet I like you the  better for having brought forward such an idea, improbable as I hope it  may be considered.
 I feel very sure of Erica.
 She has thought a great  deal, she has had every possible advantage.
 We never teach on authority;  she has been left perfectly free and has learned to weigh evidences and  probabilities, not to be led astray by any emotional fancies, but to be  guided by reason.
 She has always heard both sides of the case; she has  lived as it were in an atmosphere of debate, and has been, and of course  always will be, quite free to form her own opinion on every subject.
 It  is not for nothing that we call ourselves Freethinkers.
 Absolute freedom  of thought and speech is part of our creed.
 So far from objecting to  your holding free discussions with my daughter, I shall be positively  grateful to you, and particularly just now.
 I fancy Erica has inherited  enough of my nature to enjoy nothing better than a little opposition.
"    "I know you are a born fighter," said Charles Osmond.
 "We sympathize  with each other in that.
 And next to the bliss of a hard-won victory, I  place the satisfaction of being well conquered.
"    Raeburn laughed.
    "I am glad we think alike there.
 People are very fond of describing me  as a big bull dog, but if they would think a little, they would see that  the love of overcoming obstacles is deeply rooted in the heart of every  true man.
 What is the meaning of our English love of field sports? What  the explanation of the mania for Alpine climbing? It is no despicable  craving for distinction, it is the innate love of fighting, struggling,  and conquering.
"    "Well, there are many obstacles which we can struggle to remove, side by  side," said Charles Osmond.
 "We should be like one man, I fancy on the  question of the opium trade, for instance.
"    In a few vigorous words Raeburn denounced this monstrous national sin.
    "Are you going to the meeting tonight?" he added, after a pause.
    "Yes, I had thought of it.
 Let us go together.
 Shall you speak?"    "Not tonight," said Raeburn, a smile flickering about his usually stern  lips.
 "The Right Reverend Father, etc.
, etc.
, who is to occupy the  chair, might object to announcing that 'Mr. Raeburn would now address  the meeting.
' No, this is not the time or place for me.
 So prejudiced  are people that the mere connection of my name with the question would  probably do more harm than good.
 I should like, I confess, to get up  without introduction, to speak not from the platform but from among  the audience incognito.
 But that is impossible for a man who has the  misfortune to be five inches above the average height, and whose white  hair has become a proverb, since some one made the unfortunate remark,  repeated in a hundred newspapers, that the 'hoary head was only a crown  of glory when found in the way of righteousness.
'"    Charles Osmond could not help laughing.
    "The worst of these newspaper days is that one never can make an end of  anything.
 That remark has been made to me since at several meetings.
  At the last, I told the speaker that I was so tired of comments on my  personal appearance that I should soon have to resort either to the  dyer or the wigmaker.
 But here am I wasting your time and my own, and  forgetting the poor little maid at home.
 Goodbye.
 I'll call in passing,  then, at a quarter to eight.
 Tom Craigie will probably be with me, he is  very rabid on the subject.
"    "Craigie and I are quite old friends," said Charles Osmond.
    And then, as on the preceding night he had stood at the door while Erica  crossed the square, so now involuntarily his eyes followed Raeburn.
  In his very walk the character of the man was indicated firm, steady,  imperturbable, straightforward.
        .
 Charles Osmond Speaks His Mind         Fiat justitia ruat coelum.
  Proverb         Justice, the miracle worker among men.
  John Bright (July       14, 1868.
)    "I thought you were never coming to see me," said Erica, putting down a  newspaper and looking up with eager welcome at Charles Osmond, who had  just been announced.
    "It has not been for want of will," he replied, sitting down near her  couch, "but I have been overwhelmed with work the last few days.
 How are  you getting on? I'm glad you don't altogether refuse to see your prophet  of evil.
"    "It would have been worse if you hadn't spoken," she said, in the tone  of one trying hard to make the best of things.
 "I was rather rash though  to say that I should like my wheels to run down; I didn't know how  terrible it is to be still.
 One does so grudge all the lost time.
"    "But you will not let this be lost time you will read.
"    "Oh, yes, happily I can do that.
 And Mrs. McNaughton is going to give  me physiology lessons, and dear old Professor Gosse has promised to come  and teach me whenever he can.
 He is so devoted to father, you know, I  think he would do anything for me just because I am his child.
 It is  a comfort that father has so many real good friends.
 What I do so hate  though is the thought of having to be a passive verb for so long.
 You've  no idea how aggravating it is to lie here and listen to all that is  going on, to hear of great meetings and not to be able to go, to hear of  work to be done and not to be able to do it.
 And I suppose one notices  little things more when one is ill, for just to lie still and watch  our clumsy little servant lay the table for dinner, clattering down the  knives and forks and tossing down the plates, makes me actually cross.
  And then they let the room get so untidy; just look at that stack of  books for reviewing, and that chaos of papers in the corner.
 If I could  but get up for just five minutes I shouldn't mind.
"    "Poor child," said Charles Osmond, "this comes very hard on you.
"    "I know I'm grumbling dreadfully, but if you knew how horrid it is to  be cut off from everything! And, of course, it happens that another  controversy is beginning about that Longstaff report.
 I have been  reading half a dozen of today's newspapers, and each one is worse than  the last.
 Look here! Just read that, and try to imagine that it's your  father they are slandering! Oh, if I could but get up for one minute and  stamp!"    "And is this untrue?" asked Charles Osmond, when he had finished the  account in question.
    "There is just enough truth in it to make it worse than a direct lie,"  said Erica, hotly.
 "They have quoted his own words, but in a sense in  which he never meant them, or they have quite disregarded the context.
  If you will give me those books on the table, I'll just show you how  they have misrepresented him by hacking out single sentences, and  twisting and distorting all he says in public.
"    Charles Osmond looked at the passages referred to, and saw that Erica  had not complained without reason.
    "Yes, that is very unfair shamefully unfair," he said.
 Then, after a  pause, he added, abruptly: "Erica, are you good at languages?"    "I am very fond of them," she said, surprised at the sudden turn he had  given to the conversation.
    "Supposing that Mr. Raeburn's speeches and doings were a good deal  spoken of in Europe, as no doubt they are, and that a long time after  his death one of his successors made some converts to secularism in  Italy, and wrote in Italian all that he could remember of the life and  words of his late teacher.
 Then suppose that the Italian life of Raeburn  was translated into Chinese, and that hundreds of years after, a  heathen Chinee sat down to read it.
 His Oriental mind found it hard to  understand Mr. Raeburn's thoroughly Western mind; he didn't see anything  noble in Mr. Raeburn's character, couldn't understand his mode of  thought, read through the life, perhaps studied it after a fashion, or  believed he did; then shut it up, and said there might possibly have  been such a man, but the proofs were very weak, and, even if he had  lived, he didn't think he was any great shakes, though the people did  make such a fuss about him.
 Would you call that heathen Chinee fair?"    Erica could not help smiling, though she saw what he was driving at.
    But Charles Osmond felt much too keenly to continue in such a light  strain.
 He was no weak-minded, pleasant conversationalist, but a  prophet, who knew how to speak hard truths sometimes.
    "Erica," he said, almost sternly, "you talk much about those who quote  your father's words unfairly; but have you never misquoted the words of  Christ? You deny Him and disbelieve in Him, yet you have never really  studied His life.
 You have read the New Testament through a veil of  prejudice.
 Mind, I am not saying one word in defense of those so-called  Christians who treat you unfairly or uncharitably; but I do say that, as  far as I can see, you are quite as unfair to Christ as they are to your  father.
 Of course, you may reply that Jesus of Nazareth lived nearly  nineteen hundred years ago, and that your father is still living; that  you have many difficulties and doubts to combat, while our bigots can  verify every fact or quotation with regard to Mr. Raeburn with perfect  ease and certainty.
 That is true enough.
 But the difficulties, if  honestly faced, might be surmounted.
 You don't honestly face them; you  say to yourself, 'I have gone into all these matters carefully, and now  I have finally made up my mind; there is an end of the matter!' You  are naturally prejudiced against Christ; every day your prejudices will  deepen unless you strike out resolutely for yourself as a truth-seeker,  as one who insists on always considering all sides of the question.
  At present you are absolutely unfair, you will not take the trouble to  study the life of Christ.
"    Few people like to be told of their faults.
 Erica could just endure it  from her father, but from no one else.
 She was, besides, too young  yet to have learned even the meaning of the word humility.
 Had Charles  Osmond been a few years younger, she would not even have listened to  him.
 As it was, he was a gray-haired man, whom she loved and revered; he  was, moreover, a guest.
 She was very angry with him, but she restrained  her anger.
    He had watched her attentively while he spoke.
 She had at first only  been surprised; then her anger had been kindled, and she gave him one  swift flash from eyes which looked like live coals.
 Then she turned her  face away from him, so that he could only see one crimson cheek.
 There  was a pause after he had said his say.
 Presently, with a great effort,  Erica faced him once more, and in a manner which would have been  dignified had it not been a trifle too frigid, made some casual remark  upon a different subject.
 He saw that to stay longer was mere waste of  time.
    When the door had closed behind him, Erica's anger blazed up once more.
  That he should have dared to accuse her of unfairness! That he should  have dared actually to rebuke her! If he had given her a good shaking  she could not have felt more hurt and ruffled.
 And then to choose this  day of all others, just when life was so hard to her, just when she was  condemned to a long imprisonment.
 It was simply brutal of him! If  any one had told her that he would do such a thing she would not have  believed them.
 He had said nothing of the sort to her before, though  they had known each other so long; but, now that she was ill and  helpless and unable to get away from him, he had seen fit to come and  lecture her.
 Well, he was a parson! She might have known that sooner or  later the horrid, tyrannical, priestly side of him would show! And yet  she had liked him so much, trusted him so much! It was indescribably  bitter to think that he was no longer the hero she had thought him to  be.
 That, after all, he was not a grand, noble, self-denying man, but a  fault-finding priest!    She spent the rest of the afternoon in alternate wrath and grief.
 In the  evening Aunt Jean read her a somewhat dry book which required all her  attention, and, consequently, her anger cooled for want of thoughts to  stimulate it.
 Her father did not come in till late; but, as he carried  her upstairs to bed, she told him of Charles Osmond's interview.
    "I told him you like a little opposition," was his reply.
    "I don't know about opposition, but I didn't like him, he showed his  priestly side.
"    "I am sorry," replied Raeburn.
 "For my part I genuinely like the man;  he seems to me a grand fellow, and I should have said not in the  least spoiled by his Christianity, for he is neither exclusive, nor  narrow-minded, nor opposed to progress.
 Infatuated on one point, of  course, but a thorough man in spite of it.
"    Left once more alone in her little attic room, Erica began to think  over things more quietly.
 So her father had told him that she liked  opposition, and he had doled out to her a rebuke which was absolutely  unanswerable! But why unanswerable? She had been too angry to reply at  the time.
 It was one of the few maxims her father had given her, "When  you are angry be very slow to speak.
" But she might write an answer, a  nice, cold, cutting answer, respectful, of course, but very frigid.
 She  would clearly demonstrate to him that she was perfectly fair, and that  he, her accuser, was unfair.
    And then quite quietly, she began to turn over the accusations in  her mind.
 Quoting the words of Christ without regard to the context,  twisting their meaning.
 Neglecting real study of Christ's character and  life.
 Seeing all through a veil of prejudice.
    She would begin, like her father, with a definition of terms.
 What  did he mean by study? What did she mean by study? Well such searching  analysis, for instance, as she had applied to the character of  Hamlet, when she had had to get up one of Shakespeare's plays for her  examination.
 She had worked very hard at that, had really taken every  one of his speeches and soliloquies, and had tried to gather his true  character from them as well as from his actions.
    At this point she wandered away from the subject a little and began to  wonder when she should hear the result of the examination, and to hope  that she might get a first.
 By and by she came to herself with a sudden  and very uncomfortable shock.
 If the sort of work she had given to  Hamlet was study, HAD she ever studied the character of Christ?    She had all her life heard what her father had to say against Him, and  what a good many well-meaning, but not very convincing, people had to  say for Him.
 She had heard a few sermons and several lectures on various  subjects connected with Christ's religion.
 She had read many books both  for and against Him.
 She had read the New Testament.
 But could she quite  honestly say that she had STUDIED the character of Christ? Had she not  been predisposed to think her father in the right? He would not at all  approve of that.
 Had she been a true Freethinker? Had she not taken a  good deal to be truth because he said it? If so, she was not a bit more  fair than the majority of Christians who never took the trouble to go  into things for themselves, and study things from the point of view of  an outsider.
    In the silence and darkness of her little room, she began to suspect a  good many unpleasant and hitherto unknown facts about herself.
    "After all, I do believe that Mr. Osmond was right," she confessed at  length.
 "I am glad to get back my belief in him; but I've come to a  horrid bit of lath and plaster in myself where I thought it was all good  stone.
" She fell asleep and dreamed of the heathen Chinee, reading the  translation of the translation of her father's words, and disbelieving  altogether in "that invented demagogue, Luke Raeburn.
"    The next day Charles Osmond, sitting at work in his study, and feeling  more depressed and hopeless than he would have cared to own even to  himself, was roused by the arrival of a little three-cornered note.
 It  was as follow:    "Dear Mr. Osmond, You made me feel very angry yesterday, and sad, too,  for of course it was a case of 'Et tu, Brute.
' But last night I came  to the unpleasant conclusion that you were quite right, and that I was  quite wrong.
 To prove to you that I am no longer angry, I am going to  ask you a great favor.
 Will you teach me Greek? Your parable of the  heathen Chinee has set me thinking.
 Yours very sincerely, Erica Raeburn.
"    Charles Osmond felt the tears come to his eyes.
 The straightforward  simplicity of the letter, the candid avowal of having been "quite  wrong," an avowal not easy for one of Erica's character to make, touched  him inexpressibly.
 Taking a Greek grammar from his book shelves, he set  off at once for Guilford Terrace.
    He found Erica looking very white and fragile, and with lines of  suffering about her mouth; but, though physically weary, her mind seemed  as vigorous as ever.
 She received him with her usual frankness, and with  more animation in her look than he had seen for some weeks.
    "I did think you perfectly horrid yesterday!" she exclaimed.
 "And was  miserable, besides, at the prospect of losing one of my heroes.
 You can  be very severe.
"    "The infliction of pain is only justified when the inflictor is certain,  or as nearly certain as he can be, that the pain will be productive of  good," said Charles Osmond.
    "I suppose that is the way you account for the origin of evil," said  Erica, thoughtfully.
    "Yes," replied Charles Osmond, pleased that she should have thought of  the subject, "that to me seems the only possible explanation, otherwise  God would be either not perfectly good or not omnipotent.
 His all-wisdom  enables Him to overrule that pain which He has willed to be the  necessary outcome of infractions of His order.
 Pain, you see, is made  into a means of helping us to find out where that order has been broken,  and so teaching us to obey it in the long run.
"    "But if there is an all-powerful God, wouldn't it have been much better  if He had made it impossible for us to go wrong?"    "It would have saved much trouble, undoubtedly; but do you think that  which costs us least trouble is generally the most worth having? I  know a noble fellow who has fought his way upward through sins and  temptations you would like him, by the way, for he was once an atheist.
  He is, by virtue of all he has passed through, all he has overcome, one  of the fines men I have ever known.
"    "That is the friend, I suppose, whom your son mentioned to me.
 But I  don't see your argument, for if there was an all-powerful God, He could  have caused the man you speak of to be as noble and good without passing  through pain and temptation.
"    "But God does not work arbitrarily, but by laws of progression.
 Nor does  His omnipotence include the working of contradictions.
 He cannot both  cause a thing to be and not to be at the same time.
 If it is a law that  that which has grown by struggle and effort shall be most noble, God  will not arbitrarily reverse that law or truth because the creation of  sinless beings would involve less trouble.
"    "It all seems to me so unreal!" exclaimed Erica.
 "It seems like talking  of thin air!"    "I expect it does," said Charles Osmond, trying to realize to himself  her position.
    There was a silence.
    "How did this man of whom you speak come to desert our side?" asked  Erica.
 "I suppose, as you say he was one of the finest men you ever  knew, he must, at least, have had a great intellect.
 How did he begin to  think all these unlikely, unreal things true?"    "Donovan began by seeing the grandeur of the character of Christ.
 He  followed his example for many years, calling himself all the time an  atheist; at last he realized that in Christ we see the Father.
"    "I am sorry we lost him if he is such a nice man," was Erica's sole  comment.
 Then, turning her beautiful eyes on Charles Osmond, she said,  "I hope my note did not convey to you more than I intended.
 I asked you  if you would teach me Greek, and I mean to try to study the character of  Christ; but, quite to speak the truth, I don't really want to do it.
 I  only do it because I see I have not been fair.
"    "You do it for the sake of being a truth-seeker, the best possible  reason.
"    "I thought you would think I was going to do it because I hoped to get  something.
 I thought one of your strong points was that people must  come in a state of need and expecting to be satisfied.
 I don't expect  anything.
 I am only doing it for the sake of honesty and thoroughness.
 I  don't expect any good at all.
"    "Is it likely that you can expect when you know so little what is there?  What can you bring better than an hones mind to the search? Erica, if I  hadn't known that you were absolutely sincere, I should not have dared  to give you the pain I gave you yesterday.
 It was my trust in your  perfect sincerity which brought you that strong accusation.
 Even then it  was a sore piece of work.
"    "Did you mind it a little," exclaimed Erica.
 But directly she had  spoken, she felt that the question was absurd, for she saw a look in  Charles Osmond's eyes that made the word "little" a mockery.
    "What makes that man so loving?" she thought to herself.
 "He reminded me  almost of father, yet I am no child of his.
 I am opposed to all that he  teaches.
 I have spoken my mind out to him in a way which must sometimes  have pained him.
 Yet he cares for me so much that it pained him  exceedingly to give me pain yesterday.
"    His character puzzled her.
 The loving breath, the stern condemnation of  whatever was not absolutely true, the disregard of what the world  said, the hatred of shams, and most puzzling of all, the often apparent  struggle with himself, the unceasing effort to conquer his chief fault.
  Yet this noble, honest, intellectual man was laboring under a great  delusion, a delusion which somehow gave him an extraordinary power of  loving! Ah, no! It could not be his Christianity, though, which made him  loving, for were not most Christians hard and bitter and narrow-minded?    "I wish," she said, abruptly, "you would tell me what makes you willing  to be friends with us.
 I know well enough that the 'Church Chronicle'  has been punishing you for your defense of my father, and that there  must be a thousand disagreeables to encounter in your own set just  because you visit us.
 Why do you come?"    "Because I care for you very much.
"    "But you care, too, perhaps, for other people who will probably cut you  for flying in the face of society and visiting social outcasts.
"    "I don't think I can explain it to you yet," he replied.
 "You would only  tell me, as you told me once before, that I was talking riddles to you.
  When you have read your Greek Testament and really studied the life of  Christ, I think you will understand.
 In the meantime, St.
 Paul, I think,  answers your question better than I could, but you wouldn't understand  even his words, I fancy.
 There they are in the Greek," he opened a  Testament and showed her a passage.
 "I believe you would think the  English almost as great gibberish as this looks to you in its unknown  characters.
"    "Do you advise every one to learn Greek?"    "No, many have neither time nor ability, and those who are not apt at  languages would spend their time more usefully over good translations, I  think.
 But you have time and brains, so I am very glad to teach you.
"    "I am afraid I would much rather it were for any other purpose!" said  Erica.
 "I am somehow weary of the very name of Christianity.
 I have  heard wrangling over the Bible till I am tired to death of it,  and discussions about the Atonement and the Incarnation, and the  Resurrection, till the very words are hateful to me.
 I am afraid I shock  you, but just put yourself in my place and imagine how you would feel.
  It is not even as if I had to debate the various questions; I have  merely to sit and listen to a never-ending dispute.
"    "You sadden me; but it is quite natural that you should be weary of such  debates.
 I want you to realize, though, that in the stormy atmosphere of  your father's lecture hall, in the din and strife of controversy, it  is impossible that you should gain any true idea of Christ's real  character.
 Put aside all thought of the dogmas you have been wearied  with, and study the life of the Man.
"    Then the lesson began.
 It proved a treat to both teacher and pupil.
 When  Charles Osmond had left, Erica still worked on.
    "I should like, at any rate, to spell out his riddle," she thought to  herself, turning back to the passage he had shown her.
 And letter by  letter, and word by word, she made out "For the love of Christ--"    The verb baffled her, however, and she lay on the sofa, chafing at her  helplessness till, at length, Tom happened to come in, and brought her  the English Testament she needed.
 Ah! There it was! "For the love of  Christ constraineth us.
"    Was THAT what had made him come? Why, that was the alleged reason for  half the persecutions they met with! Did the love of Christ constrain  Charles Osmond to be their friend, and at the same time constrain the  clergy of X______ not many years before to incite the people to stone  her father, and offer him every sort of insult? Was it possible that the  love of Christ constrained Mr. Osmond to endure contempt and censure on  their behalf, and constrained Mr. Randolph to hire a band of roughs to  interrupt her father's speeches?    "He is a grand exception to the general rule," she said to herself.
 "If  there were many Christians like him, I should begin to think there must  be something more in Christianity than we thought.
 Well, if only to  please him I must try to study the New Testament over again, and as  thoroughly as I can.
 No, not to please him, though, but for the sake of  being quite honest.
 I would much rather be working at that new book of  Tyndall's.
"        .
 An Interval         How can man love but what he yearns to help?  R.
 Browning    During the year of Erica's illness, Brian began to realize his true  position toward her better than he had hitherto done.
    He saw quite well that any intrusion of his love, even any slight  manifestation of it, might do untold harm.
 She was not ready for it yet  why, he could not have told.
    The truth was, that his Undine, although in many respects a high-souled  woman, was still in some respects a child.
 She would have been merely  embarrassed by his love; she did not want it.
 She liked him very much as  an acquaintance; he was to her Tom's friend, or her doctor, or perhaps  Mr. Osmond's son.
 In this way she liked him, was even fond of him, but  as a lover he would have been a perplexing embarrassment.
    He knew well enough that her frank liking boded ill for his future  success; but in spite of that he could not help being glad to obtain any  footing with her.
 It was something even to be "Tom's friend Brian.
" He  delighted in hearing his name from her lips, although knowing that it  was no good augury.
 He lived on from day to day, thinking very little  of the doubtful future as long as he could serve her in the present.
  A reserved and silent man, devoted to his profession, and to practical  science of every kind, few people guessed that he could have any  particular story of his own.
 He was not at all the sort of man who would  be expected to fall hopelessly in love at first sight, nor would any one  have selected him as a good modern specimen of the chivalrous knight  of olden times; he was so completely a nineteenth-century man, so  progressive, so scientific.
 But, though his devotion was of the silent  order, it was, perhaps for that reason, all the truer.
 There was about  him a sort of divine patience.
 As long as he could serve Erica, he was  content to wait any number of years in the hope of winning her love.
 He  accepted his position readily.
 He knew that she had not the slightest  love for him.
 He was quite secondary to his father, even, who was one  of Erica's heroes.
 He liked to make her talk of him; her enthusiastic  liking was delightful perhaps all the more so because she was far from  agreeing with her prophet.
 Brian, with the wonderful self-forgetfulness  of true love, liked to hear the praises of all those whom she admired;  he liked to realize what were her ideals, even when conscious how far he  fell short of them.
    For it was unfortunately true that his was not the type of character she  was most likely to admire.
 As a friend she might like him much, but he  could hardly be her hero.
 His wonderful patience was quite lost upon  her; she hardly counted patience as a virtue at all.
 His grand humility  merely perplexed her; it was at present far beyond her comprehension.
  While his willingness to serve every one, even in the most trifling and  petty concerns of daily life, she often attributed to mere good nature.
  Grand acts of self-sacrifice she admired enthusiastically, but the more  really difficult round of small denials and trifling services she did  not in the least appreciate.
 Absorbed in the contemplation, as it were,  of the Hamlets in life, she had no leisure to spare for the Horatios.
    She proved a capital patient; her whole mind was set on getting well,  and her steady common sense and obedience to rules made her a great  favorite with her elder doctor.
 Really healthy, and only invalided by  the hard work and trouble she had undergone, seven or eight months' rest  did wonders for her.
 In the enforced quiet, too, she found plenty  of time for study.
 Charles Osmond had never had a better pupil.
 They  learned to know each other very well during those lessons, and many  were the perplexing questions which Erica started.
 But they were not as  before, a mere repetition of the difficulties she had been primed with  at her father's lecture hall, nor did she bring them forward with the  triumphant conviction that they were unanswerable.
 They were real,  honest questions, desiring and seeking everywhere for the true answer  which might be somewhere.
    The result of her study of the life of Christ was at first to make her a  much better secularist.
 She found to her surprise that there was much in  His teaching that entirely harmonized with secularism; that, in fact, He  spoke a great deal about the improvement of this world, and scarcely at  all about that place in the clouds of which Christians made so much.
  By the end of a year she had also reached the conviction that, whatever  interpolations there might be in the gospels, no untrue writer, no  admiring but dishonest narrator COULD have conceived such a character as  that of Christ.
 For she had dug down to the very root of the matter.
 She  had left for the present the, to her, perplexing and almost irritating  catalogue of miracles, and had begun to perceive the strength and  indomitable courage, the grand self-devotion, the all-embracing love of  the man.
 Very superficial had been her former view.
 He had been to her  a shadowy, unreal being, soft and gentle, even a little effeminate,  speaking sometimes what seemed to her narrow words about only saving the  lost sheep of the house of Israel.
 A character somehow wanting in that  Power and Intellect which she worshipped.
    But on a really deep study she saw how greatly she had been mistaken.
  Extraordinarily mistaken, both as to the character and the teaching.
  Christ was without doubt a grand ideal! To be as broad-hearted as he  was, as universally loving it would be no bad aim.
 And, as in daily life  Erica realized how hard was the practice of that love, she realized at  the same time the loftiness of the ideal, and the weakness of her own  powers.
    "But, though I do begin to see why you take this man as your ideal," she  said, one day, to Charles Osmond, "I can not, of course, accept a great  deal that He is said to have taught.
 When He speaks of love to men, that  is understandable, one can try to obey; but when he speaks about God,  then, of course, I can only think that He was deluded.
 You may admire  Joan of Arc, and see the great beauty of her character, yet at the same  time believe that she was acting under a delusion; you may admire the  character of Gotama without considering Buddhism the true religion;  and so with Christ, I may reverence and admire His character, while  believing Him to have been mistaken.
"    Charles Osmond smiled.
 He knew from many trifling signs, unnoticed by  others, that Erica would have given a great deal to see her way to an  honest acceptance of that teaching of Christ which spoke of an unseen  but everywhere present Father of all, of the everlastingness of love,  of a reunion with those who are dead.
 She hardly allowed to herself  that she longed to believe it, she dreaded the least concession to that  natural craving; she distrusted her own truthfulness, feared above all  things that she might be deluded, might imagine that to be true which  was in reality false.
    And happily, her prophet was too wise to attempt in any way to quicken  the work which was going on within her; he was one of those rare men  who can be, even in such a case, content to wait.
 He would as soon have  thought of digging up a seed to see whether he could not quicken its  slow development of root and stem as of interfering in any way with  Erica.
 He came and went, taught her Greek, and always, day after day,  week after week, month after month, however much pressed by his parish  work, however harassed by private troubles, he came to her with the  genial sympathy, the broad-hearted readiness to hear calmly all sides of  the question, which had struck her so much the very first time she had  met him.
    The other members of the family liked him almost as well, although they  did not know him so intimately as Erica.
 Aunt Jean, who had at first  been a little prejudiced against him, ended by singing his praises more  loudly than any one, perhaps conquered in spite of herself by the man's  extraordinary power of sympathy, his ready perception of good even in  those with whom he disagreed most.
    Mrs. Craigie was in many respects very like her brother, and was a very  useful worker, though much of her work was little seen.
 She did not  speak in public; all the oratorical powers of the family seemed to  have concentrated themselves in Luke Raeburn; but she wrote and worked  indefatigably, proving a very useful second to her brother.
 A hard,  wearing life, however, had told a good deal upon her, and trouble had  somewhat imbittered her nature.
 She had not the vein of humor which had  stood Raeburn in such good stead.
 Severely mater-of-fact, and almost  despising those who had any poetry in their nature, she did not always  agree very well with Erica.
 The two loved each other sincerely, and were  far too loyal both to clan and creed to allow their differences really  to separate them; but there was, undoubtedly, something in their  natures which jarred.
 Even Tom found it hard at times to bear the strong  infusion of bitter criticism which his mother introduced into the home  atmosphere.
 He was something of a philosopher, however, and knowing that  she had been through great trouble, and had had much to try her, he made  up his mind that it was natural therefore inevitable therefore to be  borne.
    The home life was not without its frets and petty trials, but on one  point there was perfect accord.
 All were devoted to the head of the  house would have sacrificed anything to bring him a few minutes' peace.
    As for Raeburn, when not occupied in actual conflict, he lived in a  sort of serene atmosphere of thought and study, far removed from all  the small differences and little cares of his household.
 They invariably  smoothed down all such roughnesses in his presence, and probably in  any case he would have been unable to see such microscopic grievances;  unless, indeed, they left any shade of annoyance on Erica's face, and  then his fatherhood detected at once what was wrong.
    It would be tedious, however, to follow the course of Erica's life for  the next three years, for, though the time was that of her chief mental  growth, her days were of the quietest.
 Not till she was two-and-twenty  did she fully recover from the effects of her sudden sorrow and the  subsequent overwork.
 In the meantime, her father's influence steadily  deepened and spread throughout the country, and troubles multiplied.

 Hyde Park         Who spouts his message to the wilderness,       Lightens his soul and feels one burden less;       But to the people preach, and you will find       They'll pay you back with thanks ill to your mind.
       Goethe.
 Translated by J.
S.
B.
    Hyde Park is a truly national property, and it is amusing and perhaps  edifying to note the various uses to which it is often put.
 In the  morning it is the rendezvous of nurses and children; in the afternoon  of a fashionable throng; on Sunday evenings it is the resort of  hard-working men and women, who have to content themselves with getting  a breath of fresh air once a week.
 But, above all, the park is the  meeting place of the people, the place for mass meetings and monster  demonstrations.
    On a bright day in June, when the trees were still in their freshest  green, the crowd of wealth and fashion had beaten an ignominious retreat  before a great political demonstration to be held that afternoon.
    Every one knew that the meeting would be a very stormy one, for it  related to the most burning question of the day, a question which was  hourly growing more and more momentous, and which for the time had  divided England into two bitterly opposed factions.
    These years which Erica had passed so quietly had been eventful years  for the country, years of strife and bloodshed, years of reckless  expenditure, years which deluded some and enraged others, provoking most  bitter animosity between the opposing parties.
 The question was not a  class question, and a certain number of the working classes and a large  number of the London roughs warmly espoused the cause of that party  which appealed to their love of power and to a selfish patriotism.
 The  Hyde Park meeting would inevitably be a turbulent one.
 Those who wished  to run no risk remained at home; Rotten Row was deserted; the carriage  road almost empty; while from the gateways there poured in a never  ending stream of people some serious-looking, some eager and excited,  some with a dangerously vindictive look, some merely curious.
 Every now  and then the more motley and disorderly crowd was reinforced by a club  with its brass band and banners, and gradually the mass of human beings  grew from hundreds to a thousand, from one thousand to many thousands,  until, indeed, it became almost impossible to form any idea of the  actual numbers, so enormous was the gathering.
    "We shall have a bad time of it today," remarked Raeburn to Brian, as  they forced their way on.
 "If I'm not very much mistaken, too, we are  vastly outnumbered.
"    He looked round the huge assembly from his vantage ground of six foot  four, his cool intrepidity not one whit shaken by the knowledge that,  by what he was about to say, he should draw down on his own head all the  wrath of the roughest portion of the crowd.
    "'Twill be against fearful odds!" said Tom, elbowing vigorously to keep  up with his companion.
    "We fear nae foe!" said Raeburn, quoting his favorite motto.
 "And,  after all, it were no bad end to die protesting against wicked rapacity,  needless bloodshed.
"    His eye kindled as he thought of the protest he hoped to make; his heart  beat high as he looked round upon the throng so largely composed of  those hostile to himself.
 Was there not a demand for his superabundant  energy? A demand for the tremendous powers of endurance, of influence,  of devotion which were stored up within him? As an athlete joys in  trying a difficult feat, as an artist joys in attempting a lofty  subject, so Raeburn in his consciousness of power, in his absolute  conviction of truth, joyed in the prospect of a most dangerous conflict.
    Brian, watching him presently from a little distance, could not wonder  at the immense influence he had gained in the country.
 The mere physique  of the man was wonderfully impressive the strong, rugged Scottish face,  the latent power conveyed in his whole bearing.
 He was no demagogue, he  never flattered the people; he preached indeed a somewhat severe creed,  but, even in his sternest mood, the hold he got over the people,  the power he had of raising the most degraded to a higher level was  marvelous.
 It was not likely, however, that his protest of today would  lead to anything but a free fight.
 If he could make himself effectually  heard, he cared very little for what followed.
 It was necessary that a  protest should be made, and he was the right man to make it; therefore  come ill or well, he would go through with it, and, if he escaped with  his life so much the better!    The meeting began.
 A moderate speaker was heard without interruption,  but the instant Raeburn stood up, a chorus of yells arose.
 For several  minutes he made no attempt to speak; but his dignity seemed to grow in  proportion with the indignities offered him.
 He stood there towering  above the crowd like a rock of strength, scanning the thousands of faces  with the steady gaze of one who, in thinking of the progress of the  race, had lost all consciousness of his own personality.
 He had come  there to protest against injustice, to use his vast strength for others,  to spend and be spent for millions, to die if need be! Raeburn was made  of the stuff of which martyrs are made; standing there face to face with  an angry crowd, which might at any moment break loose and trample him to  death or tear him to pieces, his heart was nevertheless all aglow with  the righteousness of his cause, with the burning desire to make an  availing protest against an evil which was desolating thousands of  homes.
    The majesty of his calmness began to influence the mob; the hisses and  groans died away into silence, such comparative silence, that is, as  was compatible with the greatness of the assembly.
 Then Raeburn braced  himself up; dignified before, he now seemed even more erect and stately.
  The knowledge that for the moment he had that huge crowd entirely  under control was stimulating in the highest degree.
 In a minute  his stentorian voice was ringing out fearlessly into the vast arena;  thousands of hearts were vibrating to his impassioned appeal.
 To each  one it seemed as if he individually were addressed.
    "You who call yourselves Englishmen, I come to appeal to you today! You,  who call yourselves freemen, I come to tell you that you are acting like  slaves.
"    Then with rare tact, he alluded to the strongest points of the British  character, touching with consummate skill the vulnerable parts of his  audience.
 He took for granted that their aims were pure, their standard  lofty, and by the very supposition raised for a time the most abject of  his hearers, inspired them with his own enthusiasm.
    Presently, when he felt secure enough to venture it, when the crowd was  hanging on his words with breathless attention, he appealed no longer  directly to the people, but drew, in graphic language, the picture  of the desolations brought by war.
 The simplicity of his phrases, his  entire absence of showiness or bombast, made his influence indescribably  deep and powerful.
 A mere ranter, a frothy mob orator, would have been  silenced long before.
    But this man had somehow got hold of the great assembly, had conquered  them by sheer force of will; in a battle of one will against thousands  the one had conquered, and would hold its own till it had administered  the hard home-thrust which would make the thousands wince and retaliate.
    Now, under the power of that "sledge-hammer Saxon," that marvelously  graphic picture of misery and bereavement, hard-headed, and hitherto  hard hearted men were crying like children.
 Then came the rugged  unvarnished statement shouted forth in the speaker's sternest voice.
    "All this is being done in your name, men of England! Not only in your  name, but at your cost! You are responsible for this bloodshed, this  misery! How long is it to go on? How long are you free men going to  allow yourselves to be bloody executioners? How long are you to be  slavish followers of that grasping ambition which veils its foulness  under the fair name of patriotism?"    Loud murmurs began to arise at this, and the orator knew that the ground  swell betokened the coming storm.
 He proceeded with tenfold energy, his  words came down like hailstones, with a fiery indignation he delivered  his mighty philippic, in a torrent of forceful words he launched out the  most tremendous denunciation he had ever uttered.
    The string had been gradually worked up to its highest possible  tension; at length when the strain was the greatest it suddenly snapped.
  Raeburn's will had held all those thousands in check; he had kept his  bitterest enemies hanging on his words; he had lashed them into fury,  and still kept his grip over them; he had worked them up, gaining more  and more power over them, till at length, as he shouted forth the last  words of a grand peroration, the bitterness and truth of his accusations  proved keener than his restraining influence.
    He had foreseen that the spell would break, and he knew the instant  it was broken.
 A moment before, and he had been able to sway that huge  crowd as he pleased; now he was at their mercy.
 No will power, no force  of language, no strength of earnestness or truth would avail him now.
  All that he had to trust to was his immense physical strength, and what  was that when measured against thousands?    He saw the dangerous surging movement in the sea of heads, and knew only  too well what it betokened.
 With a frightful yell of mingled hatred  and execration, the seething human mass bore down upon him! His own  followers and friends did what they could for him, but that was very  little.
 His case was desperate.
 Desperation, however, inspires some  people with an almost superhuman energy.
 Life was sweet, and that day he  fought for his life.
 The very shouting and hooting of the mob, the roar  of the angry multitude, which might well have filled even a brave man  with panic, stimulated him, strengthened him to resist to the uttermost.
    He fought like a lion, forcing his way through the furious crowd,  attacked in the most brutal way on every side, yet ever struggling on  if only by inches.
 Never once did his steadfastness waver, never for  a single instant did his spirit sink.
 His unfailing presence of mind  enabled him to get through what would have been impossible to most  men, his great height and strength stood him in good stead, while the  meanness and the injustice of the attack, the immense odds against which  he was fighting nerved him for the struggle.
    It was more like a hideous nightmare than a piece of actual life, those  fierce tiger faces swarming around, that roar of vindictive anger, that  frightful crushing, that hail storm of savage blows! But, whether life  or nightmare, it must be gone through with.
 In the thick of the fight a  line of Goethe came to his mind, one of his favorite mottoes; "Make good  thy standing place and move the world.
"    And even then he half smiled to himself at the forlornness of the hope  that he should ever need a standing place again.
    With renewed vigor he fought his way on, and with a sort of glow  of triumph and new-born hope had almost seen his way to a place of  comparative safety, when a fearful blow hopelessly maimed him.
 With a  vain struggle to save himself he fell to the earth a vision of fierce  faces, green leaves, and blue sky flashed before his eyes, an inward  vision of Erica, a moment's agony, and then the surging crowd closed  over him, and he knew no more.
        .
 At Death's Door         Sorrow and wrong are pangs of a new birth;       All we who suffer bleed for one another;       No life may live alone, but all in all;       We lie within the tomb of our dead selves,       Waiting till One command us to arise.

    Knowing that Erica would have a very anxious afternoon, Charles Osmond  gave up his brief midday rest, snatched a hasty lunch at a third-rate  restaurant, finished his parish visits sooner than usual, and reached  the little house in Guilford Terrace in time to share the worst part of  her waiting.
 He found her hard at work as usual, her table strewn with  papers and books of reference.
 Raeburn had purposely left her some work  to do for him which he knew would fully occupy her; but the mere fact  that she knew he had done it on purpose to engross her mind with other  matters entirely prevented her from giving it her full attention.
 She  had never felt more thankful to see Charles Osmond than at that moment.
    "When your whole heart and mind are in Hyde Park, how are you to drag  them back to what some vindictive old early Father said about the  eternity of punishment?" she exclaimed, with a smile, which very thinly  disguised her consuming anxiety.
    They sat down near the open window, Erica taking possession of that  side which commanded the view of the entrance of the cul-de-sac.
 Charles  Osmond did not speak for a minute or two, but sat watching her, trying  to realize to himself what such anxiety as hers must be.
 She was  evidently determined to keep outwardly calm, not to let her fears gain  undue power over her; but she could not conceal the nervous trembling  which beset her at every sound of wheels in the quiet square, nor  did she know that in her brave eyes there lurked the most visible  manifestation possible of haggard, anxious waiting.
 She sat with her  watch in her hand, the little watch that Eric Haeberlein had given  her when she was almost a child, and which, even in the days of their  greatest poverty, her father had never allowed her to part with.
 What  strange hours it had often measured for her.
 Age-long hours of grief,  weary days of illness and pain, times of eager expectation, times of  sickening anxiety, times of mental conflict, of baffling questions and  perplexities.
 How the hands seemed to creep on this afternoon, at times  almost to stand still.
    "Now, I suppose if you were in my case you would pray," said Erica,  raising her eyes to Charles Osmond.
 "It must be a relief, but yet, when  you come to analyze it, it is most illogical a fearful waste of time.
 If  there is a God who works by fixed laws, and who sees the whole maze of  every one's life before hand, then the particular time and manner of my  father's death must be already appointed, and no prayer of mine that  he may come safely through this afternoon's danger can be of the least  avail.
 Besides, if a God could be turned round from His original purpose  by human wills and much speaking, I hardly think He would be worth  believing in.
"    "You are taking the lowest view of prayer mere petition; but even  that, I think, is set on its right footing as soon as we grasp the true  conception of the ideal father.
 Do you mean to say that, because your  father's rules were unwavering and his day's work marked out beforehand,  he did not like you to come to him when you were a little child,  with all your wishes and longings and requests, even though they were  sometimes childish and often impossible to gratify? Would he have been  better pleased if you had shut up everything in your own heart, and  never of your own accord told him anything about your babyish plans and  wants?"    "Still, prayer seems to me a waste of time," said Erica.
    "What! If it brings you a talk with your Father? If it is a relief to  you and a pleasure because a sign of trust and love to Him? But in one  way I entirely agree with you, unless it is spontaneous it is not only  useless but harmful.
 Imagine a child forced to talk to its father.
 And  this seems to me the truest defense of prayer; to the 'natural man'  it always will seem foolishness, to the 'spiritual man' to one who has  recognized the All-Father it is the absolute necessity of life.
 And  I think by degrees one passes from eager petition for personal and  physical good things into the truer and more Christlike spirit of  prayer.
 'These are my fears, these are my wishes, but not my will but  Thine be done.
' Shakespeare had got hold of a grand truth, it seems to  me, when he said:    "'So find we profit by losing of our prayers.
'"    "And yet your ideal man distinctly said: 'Ask and ye shall receive'"  said Erica.
 "There are no limitations.
 For aught we know, some  pig-headed fanatic may be at this moment praying that God in His mercy  would rid the earth of that most dangerous man, Luke Raeburn; while  I might be of course I am not, but it is conceivable that I might be  praying for his safety.
 Both of us might claim the same promise, 'Ask  and ye shall receive.
'"    "You forget one thing," said Charles Osmond.
 "You would both pray to the  Father, and His answer which you, by the way, might consider no answer  would be the answer of a father.
 Do you not think the fanatic  would certainly find profit in having his most unbrotherly request  disregarded? And the true loss or gain of prayer would surely be in  this: The fanatic would, by his un-Christlike request, put himself  further from God; you, by your spontaneous and natural avowal of need  and recognition of a Supreme loving will, would draw nearer to God.
  Nor do we yet at all understand the extraordinary influence exerted on  others by any steady, earnest concentration of thought; science is but  just awakening to the fact that there is an unknown power which we have  hitherto never dreamed of.
 I have great hope that in this direction, as  in all others, science may show us the hidden workings of our Father.
"    Erica forgot her anxiety for a moment; she was watching Charles Osmond's  face with mingled curiosity and perplexity.
 To speak to one whose belief  in the Unseen seemed stronger and more influential than most people's  belief in the seen, was always very strange to her, and with her prophet  she was almost always conscious of this double life (SHE considered it  double a real outer and an imaginary inner.
) His strong conviction; the  every-day language which he used in speaking of those truths which  most people from a mistaken notion of reverence, wrap up in a sort of  ecclesiastical phraseology; above all, the carrying out in his life of  the idea of universal brotherhood, with so many a mere form of words all  served to impress Erica very deeply.
 She knew him too well and loved him  too truly to pause often, as it were, to analyze his character.
 Every  now and then, however, some new phase was borne in upon her, and some  chance word, emphasizing the difference between them, forced her from  sheer honesty to own how much that was noble seemed in him to be the  outcome of faith in Christ.
    They went a little more deeply into the prayer question.
 Then, with the  wonder growing on her more and more, Erica suddenly exclaimed: "It is  so wonderful to me that you can believe without logical proof believe a  thing which affects your whole life so immensely, and yet be unable to  demonstrate the very existence of a God.
"    "Do you believe your father loves you?" asked Charles Osmond.
    "My father! Why, of course.
"    "You can't logically prove that his love has any true existence.
"    "Why, yes!" exclaimed Erica.
 "Not a day passes without some word, look,  thought, which would prove it to any one.
 If there is one thing that I  am certain of in the whole world, it is that my father loves me.
 Why,  you who know him so well, you must know that! You must have seen that.
"    "All his care of you may be mere self-interest," said Charles Osmond.
  "Perhaps he puts on a sort of appearance of affection for you just  for the sake of what people would say not a very likely thing for Mr.  Raeburn to consider, I own.
 Still, you can't demonstrate to me that his  love is a reality.
"    "But I KNOW it is!" cried Erica, vehemently.
    "Of course you know, my child; you know in your heart, and our hearts  can teach us what no power of intellect, no skill in logic can every  teach us.
 You can't logically prove the existence of your father's love,  and I can't logically prove the existence of the all-Father; but in  our hearts we both of us know.
 The deepest, most sacred realities are  generally those of heart-knowledge, and quite out of the pale of logic.
"    Erica did not speak, but sat musing.
 After all, what COULD be proved  with absolute certainty? Why, nothing, except such bare facts as  that two and two make four.
 Was even mathematical proof so absolutely  certain? Were they not already beginning to talk of a possible fourth  dimension of space when even that might no longer be capable of  demonstration.
    "Well, setting aside actual proof," she resumed, after a silence, "how  do you bring it down even to a probability that God is?"    "We must all of us start with a supposition," said Charles Osmond.
  "There must on the one hand either be everlasting matter or everlasting  force, whether these be two real existences, or whether matter be only  force conditioned, or, on the other hand, you have the alternative  of the everlasting 'He.
' You at present base your belief on the first  alternative.
 I base mine on the last, which, I grant you, is at the  outset the most difficult of the two.
 I find, however, that nine  times out of ten the most difficult theory is the truest.
 Granting the  everlasting 'He,' you must allow self-consciousness, without which there  could be no all powerful, all knowledge-full, and all love-full.
 We will  not quarrel about names; call the Everlasting what you please.
 'Father'  seems to me at once the highest and simplest name.
"    "But evil!" broke in Erica, triumphantly.
 "If He originates all, he must  originate evil as well as good.
"    "Certainly," said Charles Osmond, "He has expressly told us so.
 'I form  the light and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I, the  Lord, do all these things.
'"    "I recollect now, we spoke of this two or three years ago," said  Erica.
 "You said that the highest good was attained by passing through  struggles and temptations.
"    "Think of it in this way," said Charles Osmond.
 "The Father is educating  His children; what education was ever brought about without pain? The  wise human father does not so much shield his child from small pains,  but encourages him to get wisdom from them for the future, tries to  teach him endurance and courage.
 Pain is necessary as an element in  education, possibly there is no evolution possible without it.
 The  father may regret it, but, if he is wise, knows that it must be.
 He  suffers twice as much as the child from the infliction of the pain.
 The  All-Father, being at once all-knowing and all-loving, can see the end  of the education while we only see it in process, and perhaps exclaim:  'What a frightful state of things,' or like your favorite 'Stephen  Blackpool,' 'It's all a muddle.
'"    "And the end you consider to be perfection, and eternal union with God.
  How can you think immortality probable?"    "It is the necessary outcome of belief in such a God, such a Father as  we have spoken of.
 What! Could God have willed that His children whom He  really loves should, after a time, fade utterly away? If so, He would be  less loving than an average earthly father.
 If He did indeed love them,  and would fain have had them ever with Him, but could not, then He would  not be all-powerful.
"    "I see you a universalist, a great contrast to my Early Father here,  who gloats over the delightful prospect of watching from his comfortable  heaven the tortures of all unbelievers.
 But, tell me, what do you  think would be our position in your unseen world? I suppose the mere  realization of having given one's life in a mistaken cause would be  about the most terrible pain conceivable?"    "I think," said Charles Osmond, with one of his grave, quiet smiles,  "that death will indeed be your 'gate of life,' that seeing the light  you will come to your true self, and exclaim, 'Who'd have thought it?'"    The every day language sounded quaint, it made Erica smile; but Charles  Osmond continued, with a brightness in his eyes which she was far from  understanding: "And you know there are to be those who shall say: 'Lord  when saw we Thee in distress and helped Thee?' They had not recognized  Him here, but He recognized them there? They shared in the 'Come ye  blessed of my Father.
'"    "Well," said Erica, thoughtfully, "if any Christianity be true, it must  be your loving belief, not the blood-thirsty scheme of the Calvinists.
  If THAT could by any possibility be true, I should greatly prefer, like  Kingsley's dear old 'Wulf,' to share hell with my own people.
"    The words had scarcely left her lips when, with a startled cry, she  sprung to her feet and hurried to the door.
 The next moment Charles  Osmond saw Tom pass the window; he was unmistakably the bearer of bad  news.
    His first panting words were reassuring "Brian says you are not to be  frightened;" but they were evidently the mere repetition of a message.
  Tom himself was almost hopeless; his wrath and grief become more  apparent every minute as he gave an incoherent account of the  afternoon's work.
    The brutes, the fiends, had half killed the chieftain, had set on him  like so many tigers.
 Brian and Hazeldine were bringing him home had sent  him on to prepare.
    Erica had listened so far with a colorless face, and hands tightly  clasped, but the word "prepare" seemed to bring new life to her.
 In an  instant she was her strongest self.
    "They will never try to take him up that steep narrow staircase.
 Quick,  Tom! Help me to move this couch into the study.
"    The little Irish servant was pressed into the service, too, and sent  upstairs to fetch and carry, and in a very few minutes the preparations  were complete, and Erica had at hand all the appliances most likely to  be needed.
 Just as all was done, and she was beginning to feel that a  minute's pause would be the "last straw," Tom heard the sound of wheels  in the square, and hurried out.
 Erica stood in the doorway watching, and  presently saw a small crowd of helpers bearing a deathly looking burden.
  Whiteness of death redness of blood.
 The ground seemed rocking beneath  her feet, when a strong hand took hers and drew her into the house.
    "Don't be afraid," said a voice, which she knew to be Brian's though a  black mist would not let her see him.
 "He was conscious a minute ago;  this is only from the pain of moving.
 Which room?"    "The study," she replied, recovering herself.
 "Give me something to do,  Brian, quickly.
"    He saw that in doing lay her safety, and kept her fully employed, so  much so, indeed, that from sheer lack of time she was able to stave off  the faintness which had threatened to overpower her.
 After a time her  father came to himself, and Erica's face, which had been the last in his  mind in full consciousness, was the first which now presented itself to  his awakening gaze.
 He smiled.
    "Well, Erica! So, after all, they haven't quite done for me.
 Nine lives  like a cat, as I always told you.
"    His voice was faint, but with all his wonted energy he raised himself  before they could remonstrate.
 He was far more injured, however, than he  knew; with a stifled groan he fell back once more in a swoon, and it was  many hours before they were able to restore him.
    After that, fever set in, and a shadow as of death fell on the house  in Guilford Terrace.
 Doctors came and went; Brian almost lived with  his patient; friends Raeburn had hosts of them came with help of every  description.
 The gloomy little alley admitted every day crowds of  inquirers, who came to the door, read the bulletin, glanced up at the  windows, and went away looking graver than when they came.
    Erica lost count of time altogether.
 The past seemed blotted out; the  weight of the present was so great that she would not admit any thought  of the future, though conscious always of a blank dread which she  dared not pause to analyze, sufficient indeed for her day was the evil  thereof.
 She struggled on somehow with a sort of despairing strength;  only once or twice did she even recollect the outside world.
    It happened that on the first Wednesday after the Hyde Park meeting  some one mentioned the day of the week in her hearing.
 She was in the  sick-room at the time, but at once remembered that her week's work was  untouched, that she had not written a line for the "Idol-Breaker.
" Every  idea seemed to have gone out of her head; for a minute she felt that to  save her life she could not write a line.
 But still she conscientiously  struggled to remember what subject had been allotted her, and in the  temporary stillness of the first night-watch drew writing materials  toward her, and leaned her head on her hands until, almost by an effort  of will, she at length recalled the theme for her article.
    Of course! It was to be that disgraceful disturbance in the church at  Z______.
 She remembered the whole affair now, it all rose up before her  graphically not a bad subject at all! Their party might make a good deal  by it.
 Her article must be bright, descriptive, sarcastic.
 Yet how  was she to write such an article when her heart felt like lead? An  involuntary "I can't" rose to her lips, and she glanced at her father's  motionless form, her eyes filling with tears.
 Then one of his sayings  came to her mind: "No such word as 'Can't' in the dictionary," and began  to write rapidly almost defiantly.
 No sooner had she begun than her very  exhaustion, the lateness of the hour, and the stress of circumstance  came to her aid she had never before written so brilliantly.
    The humor of the scene struck her; little flashes of mirth at the  expense of both priest and people, delicate sarcasms, the more searching  from their very refinement, awoke in her brain and were swiftly  transcribed.
 In the middle of one of the most daring sentences Raeburn  stirred.
 Erica's pen was thrown down at once; she was at his side  absorbed once more in attending to his wants, forgetful quite of  religious controversy, of the "Idol-Breaker," of anything in fact in the  whole world but her father.
 Not till an hour had passed was she free to  finish her writing, but by the time her aunt came to relieve guard at  two o'clock the article was finished and Erica stole noiselessly into  the next room to put it up.
    To her surprise she found that Tom had not gone to bed.
 He was still  toiling away at his desk with a towel round his head; she could almost  have smiled at the ludicrous mixture of grief and sleepiness on his  face, had not her own heart been so loaded with care and sadness.
 The  post brought in what Tom described as "bushels" of letters every day,  and he was working away at them now with sleepy heroism.
    "How tired you look," said Erica.
 "See! I have brought in this for the  'Idol.
'"    "You've been writing it now! That is good of you.
 I was afraid we should  have to make up with some wretched padding of Blank's.
"    He took the sheets from her and began to read.
 Laughter is often only  one remove from grief, and Tom, though he was sad-hearted enough, could  not keep his countenance through Erica's article.
 First his shoulders  began to shake, then he burst into such a paroxysm of noiseless laughter  that Erica, fearing that he could not restrain himself, and would be  heard in the sick-room, pulled the towel from his forehead over his  mouth; then, conquered herself by the absurdity of his appearance, she  was obliged to bury her own face in her hands, laughing more and more  whenever the incongruousness of the laughter occurred to her.
 When they  had exhausted themselves the profound depression which had been the real  cause of the violent reaction returned with double force.
 Tom sighed  heavily and finished reading the article with the gravest of faces.
 He  was astonished that Erica could have written at such a time an article  positively scintillating with mirth.
    "How did you manage anything so witty tonight of all nights?" he asked.
    "Don't you remember Hans Andersen's clown Punchinello," said Erica.
 "He  never laughed and joked so gayly as the night when his love died and his  own heart was broken.
"    There was a look in her eyes which made Tom reply, quickly: "Don't write  any more just now; the professor has promised us something for next  week.
 Don't write any more till till the chieftain is well.
"    After that she wished him good night rather hastily, crept upstairs to  her attic, and threw herself down on her bed.
 Why had he spoken of the  future? Why had his voice hesitated? No, she would not think, she would  not.
    So the article appeared in that week's "Idol-Breaker", and thousands and  thousands of people laughed over it.
 It even excited displeased comment  from "the other side," and in many ways did a great deal of what in  Guilford Terrace was considered "good work.
" For Erica herself, it was  long before she had time to give it another thought; it was to her only  a desperately hard duty which she had succeeded in doing.
 Nobody every  guessed how much it had cost her.
    The weary time dragged on, days and weeks passed by; Raeburn was growing  weaker, but clung to life with extraordinary tenacity.
 And now very  bitterly they felt the evils of this voluntarily embraced poverty, for  the summer heat was for a few days almost tropical, and the tiny little  rooms in the lodging-house were stifling.
 Brian was very anxious to  have the patient moved across to his father's house; but, though Charles  Osmond said all he could in favor of the scheme, the other doctors would  not consent, thinking the risk of removal too great.
 And, besides,  it would be useless, they maintained the atheist was evidently dying.
  Brian, who was the youngest, could not carry out his wishes in defiance  of the others, but he would not deny himself the hope of even yet saving  Erica's father.
 He devised punkahs, became almost nurse and doctor in  one, and utterly refused to lose heart.
 Erica herself was the only other  person who shared his hopefulness, or perhaps her feeling could  hardly be described by that word; she was not hopeful, but she had  so resolutely set herself to live in the present that she had managed  altogether to crowd out the future, and with it the worst fear.
    One day, however, it broke upon her suddenly.
 Some one had left a  newspaper in the sick-room; it was weeks since she had seen one, and in  a brief interval, while her father slept, or seemed to sleep, she took  it up half mechanically.
 How much it would have interested her a little  while ago, how meaningless it all seemed to her now.
 "Latest Telegrams,"  "News from the Seat of War," "Parliamentary Intelligence" a speech by  Sir Michael Cunningham, one of her heroes, on a question in which she  was interested.
 She could not read it, all the life seemed gone out of  it, today the paper was nothing to her but a broad sheet with so many  columns of printed matter.
 But as she was putting it down their own name  caught her eye.
 All at once her benumbed faculties regained their power,  her heart began to beat wildly, for there, in clearest print, in short,  choppy, unequivocal sentences, was the hideous fear which she had  contrived so long to banish.
    "Mr. Raeburn is dying.
 The bulletins have daily been growing less and  less hopeful.
 Yesterday doctor R______, who had been called in, could  only confirm the unfavorable opinion of the other doctors.
 In all  probability the days of the great apostle of atheism are numbered.
 It  rests with the Hyde Park rioters, and those who by word and example have  incited them, to bear the responsibility of making a martyr of such a  man as Mr. Luke Raeburn.
 Emphatically disclaiming the slightest sympathy  with Mr. Raeburn's religious views, we yet--"    But Erica could read no more.
 Whatever modicum of charity the writer  ventured to put forth was lost upon her.
 The opening sentence danced  before her eyes in letters of fire.
 That morning she met Brian in the  passage and drew him into the sitting room.
 He saw at once how it was  with her.
    "Look," she said, holding the newspaper toward him, "is that true? Or is  it only a sensation trap or written for party purposes?"    Her delicate lips were closed with their hardest expression, her eyes  only looked grave and questioning.
 She watched his face as he read, lost  her last hope, and with the look of such anguish as he had never before  seen, drew the paper from him, and caught his hand in hers in wild  entreaty.
    "Oh, Brian, Brian! Is there no hope? Surely you can do something for  him.
 There MUST be hope, he is so strong, so full of life.
"    He struggled hard for voice and words to answer her, but the imploring  pressure of her hands on his had nearly unnerved him.
 Already the grief  that kills lurked in her eyes he knew that if her father died she would  not long survive him.
    "Don't say what is untrue," she continued.
 "Don't let me drive you into  telling a lie but only tell me if there is indeed no hope no chance.
"    "It may be," said Brian.
 "You must not expect, for those far wiser than  I say it can not be.
 But I hope yes, I still hope.
"    On that crumb of comfort she lived, but it was a weary day, and for  the first time she noticed that her father, who was free from fever,  followed her everywhere with his eyes.
 She knew intuitively that he  thought himself dying.
    Toward evening she was sitting beside him, slowly drawing her fingers  through his thick masses of snow-white hair in the way he liked best,  when he looked suddenly right into her eyes with his own strangely  similar ones, deep, earnest eyes, full now of a sort of dumb yearning.
    "Little son Eric," he said, faintly, "you will go on with the work I am  leaving.
"    "Yes, father," she replied firmly, though her heart felt as if it would  break.
    "A harmful delusion," he murmured, half to himself, "taking up our best  men! Swallowing up the money of the people.
 What's that singing, Erica?"    "It is the children in the hospital," she replied.
 "I'll shut the window  if they disturb you, father.
"    "No," he said.
 "One can tolerate the delusion for them if it makes their  pain more bearable.
 Poor bairns! Poor bairns! Pain is an odd mystery.
"    He drew down her hand and held it in his, seeming to listen to the  singing, which floated in clearly through the open window at right  angles with the back windows of the hospital.
 Neither of them knew what  the hymn was, but the refrain which came after every verse as if even  the tinies were joining in it was quite audible to Luke Raeburn and his  daughter.
    "Through life's long day, and death's dark night, Oh, gentle Jesus, be  our light.
"    Erica's breath came in gasps.
 To be reminded then that life was long and  that death was dark!    She thought she had never prayed, she had never consciously prayed, but  her whole life for the past three years had been an unspoken prayer.
  Never was there a more true desire entirely unexpressed than the desire  which now seemed to possess her whole being.
 The darkness would soon  hide forever the being she most loved.
 Oh, if she could but honestly  think that He who called Himself the Light of the world was indeed still  living, still ready to help!    But to allow her distress to gain the mastery over her would certainly  disturb and grieve her father.
 With a great effort she stifled the sobs  which would rise in her throat, and waited in rigid stillness.
 When the  last notes of the hymn had died away into silence, she turned to look at  her father.
 He had fallen asleep.
        .
 Answered or Unanswered?         "Glory to God to God!" he saith,       "Knowledge by suffering entereth,       And life is perfected by death.
"  E.
 B.
 Browning    "Mr. Raeburn is curiously like the celebrated dog of nursery lore, who  appertained to the ancient and far-famed Mother Hubbard.
 All the  doctors gave him up, all the secularists prepared mourning garments,  the printers were meditating black borders for the 'Idol-Breaker,' the  relative merits of burial and cremation were already in discussion, when  the dog we beg pardon the leader of atheism, came to life again.
         "'She went to the joiners to buy him a coffin,       But when she came back the dog was laughing.
'    "History," as a great man was fond of remarking, "'repeats itself.
'"    Raeburn laughed heartily over the accounts of his recovery in the comic  papers.
 No one better appreciated the very clever representation of  himself as a huge bull-dog starting up into life while Britannia in  widow's weeds brought in a parish coffin.
 Erica would hardly look at the  thing; she had suffered too much to be able to endure any jokes on  the subject, and she felt hurt and angry that what had given her such  anguish should be turned into a foolish jest.
    At length, after many weeks of weary anxiety, she was able to breathe  freely once more, for her father steadily regained his strength.
 The  devotion of her whole time and strength and thought to another had done  wonders for her, her character had strangely deepened and mellowed.
 But  no sooner was she free to begin her ordinary life than new perplexities  beset her on every side.
    During her own long illness she had of course been debarred from  attending any lectures or meetings whatever.
 In the years following,  before she had quite regained her strength, she had generally gone to  hear her father, but had never become again a regular attendant at the  lecture hall.
 Now that she was quite well, however, there was nothing  to prevent her attending as many lectures as she pleased, and naturally,  her position as Luke Raeburn's daughter made her presence desirable.
  So it came to pass one Sunday evening in July that she happened to be  present at a lecture given by a Mr. Masterman.
    He was a man whom they knew intimately.
 Erica liked him sufficiently  well in private life, and he had been remarkably kind and helpful at the  time of her father's illness.
 It was some years, however, since she had  heard him lecture, and this evening, by the virulence of his attack  on the character of Christ, he revealed to her how much her ground had  shifted since she had last heard him.
 It was not that he was an opponent  of existing Christianity her father was that, she herself was that, and  felt bound to be as long as she considered it a lie but Mr. Masterman's  attack seemed to her grossly unfair, almost willfully inaccurate, and,  in addition, his sarcasm and pleasantries seemed to her odiously vulgar.
  He was answered by a most miserable representative of Christianity, who  made a foolish, weak, blustering speech, and tried to pay the atheist  back in his own coin.
 Erica felt wretched.
 She longed to get up and  speak herself, longing flatly to contradict the champion of her own  cause; then grew frightened at the strength of her feelings.
 Could this  be mere love of fair play and justice? Was her feeling merely that of a  barrister who would argue as well on one side as the other? And yet her  displeasure in itself proved little or nothing.
 Would not Charles Osmond  be displeased and indignant if he heard her father unjustly spoken of?  Yes, but then Luke Raeburn was a living man, and Christ was she even  sure that he had ever lived? Well, yes, sure of that, but of how much  more?    When the assembly broke up, her mind was in a miserable chaos of doubt.
    It was one of those delicious summer evenings when even in East London  the skies are mellow and the air sweet and cool.
    "Oh, Tom, let us walk home!" she exclaimed, longing for change of scene  and exercise.
    "All right," he replied, "I'll take you a short cut, if you don't mind a  few back slums to begin with.
"    Now Erica was familiar enough with the sight of poverty and squalor;  she had not lived at the West End, where you may entirely forget  the existence of the poor.
 The knowledge of evil had come to her of  necessity much earlier than to most girls, and tonight, as Tom took her  through a succession of narrow streets and dirty courts, misery, and  vice, and hopeless degradation met her on every side.
 Swarms of filthy  little children wrangled and fought in the gutters, drunken women  shouted foul language at one another everywhere was wickedness  everywhere want.
 Her heart felt as if it would break.
 What was to reach  these poor, miserable fellow creatures of hers? Who was to raise them  out of their horrible plight? The coarse distortion and the narrow  contraction of Christ's teaching which she had just heard, offered no  remedy for this evil.
 Nor could she think that secularism would reach  these.
 To understand secularism you meed a fair share of intellect what  intellect would these poor creatures have? Why, you might talk forever  of the "good of humanity," and "the duty of promoting the general good,"  and they would not so much as grasp the idea of what "good" was they  would sink back to their animal-like state.
 Instinctively her thoughts  turned to the Radical Reformer who, eighteen hundred years ago, had  lived among people just as wicked, just as wretched.
 How had He worked?  What had He done? All through His words and actions had sounded the one  key-note, "Your Father.
" Always He had led them to look up to a perfect  Being who loved them, who was present with them.
    Was it possible that if Christians had indeed followed their Leader and  not obscured His teaching with hideous secretions of doctrine which He  had assuredly never taught was it possible that the Christ-gospel in its  original simplicity would indeed be the remedy for all evil?    They were coming into broader thoroughfares now.
 A wailing child's voice  fell on her ear.
 A small crowd of disreputable idlers was hanging round  the closed doors of a public-house, waiting eagerly for the opening  which would take place at the close of service-time.
 The wailing child's  voice grew more and more piteous.
 Erica saw that it came from a poor  little half-clad creature of three years old who was clinging to the  skirts of a miserable-looking woman with a shawl thrown over her head.
  Just as she drew near, the woman, with a fearful oath, tried to shake  herself free of the child; then, with uplifted arms, was about to deal  it a heavy blow when Erica caught her hand as it descended, and held it  fast in both her hands.
    "Don't hurt him," she said, "please don't hurt him.
"    She looked into the prematurely wrinkled face, into the half-dim eyes,  she held the hand fast with a pressure not of force but of entreaty.
  Then they passed on, the by-standers shouting out the derisive chorus  of "Come to Jesus!" with which London roughs delight in mocking any  passenger whom they suspect of religious tendencies.
 In all her sadness,  Erica could not help smiling to herself.
 That she, an atheist, Luke  Raeburn's daughter, should be hooted at as a follower of Jesus!    In the meantime the woman she had spoken to stood still staring after  her.
 If an angel had suddenly appeared to her, she could not have been  more startled.
 A human hand had given her coarse, guilty, trembling hand  such a living pressure as it had never before received; a pure, loving  face had looked at her; a voice, which was trembling with earnestness  and full of the pathos of restrained tears, had pleaded with her for her  own child.
 The woman's dormant motherhood sprung into life.
 Yes, he was  her own child after all.
 She did not really want to hurt him, but a sort  of demon was inside her, the demon of drink and sometimes it made her  almost mad.
 She looked down now with love-cleared eyes at the little  crying child who still clung to her ragged skirt.
 She stooped and picked  him up, and wrapped a bit of her shawl round him.
 Presently after a  fearful struggle, she turned away from the public-house and carried the  child home to bed.
    The jeering chorus was soon checked, for the shutters were taken down,  and the doors thrown wide, and light, and cheerfulness, and shelter, and  the drink they were all craving for, were temptingly displayed to draw  in the waiting idlers.
    But the woman had gone home, and one rather surly looking man still  leaned against the wall looking up the street where Tom and Erica had  disappeared.
    "Blowed if that ain't a bit of pluck!" he said to himself, and therewith  fell into a reverie.
    Tom talked of temperance work, about which he was very eager, all the  way to Guilford Terrace.
 Erica, on reaching home, went at once to her  father's room.
 She found him propped up with pillows in his arm  chair; he was still only well enough to attempt the lightest of light  literature, and was looking at some old volumes of "Punch" which the  Osmonds had sent across.
    "You look tired, Eric!" he exclaimed.
 "Was there a good attendance?"    "Very," she replied, but so much less brightly than usual that Raeburn  at once divined that something had annoyed her.
    "Was Mr. Masterman dull?"    "Not dull," she replied, hesitatingly.
 Then, with more than her usual  vehemence, "Father, I can't endure him! I wish we didn't have such men  on our side! He is so flippant, so vulgar!"    "Of course he never was a model of refinement," said Raeburn, "but he  is effective very effective.
 It is impossible that you should like  his style; he is, compared with you, what a theatrical poster is to a  delicate tete-de-greuze.
 How did he specially offend you tonight?"    "It was all hateful from the very beginning," said Erica.
 "And sprinkled  all through with doubtful jests, which of course pleased the people.
 One  despicable one about the Entry into Jerusalem, which I believe he must  have got from Strauss.
 I'm sure Strauss quotes it.
"    "You see what displeases an educated mind, wins a rough, uncultured one.
  We may not altogether like it, but we must put up with it.
 We need our  Moodys and Sankeys as well as the Christians.
"    "But, father, he seems to me so unfair.
"    Raeburn looked grave.
    "My dear," he said, after a minute's thought, "you are not in the least  bound to go to hear Mr. Masterman again unless you like.
 But remember  this, Eric, we are only a struggling minority, and let me quote to you  one of our Scottish proverbs: 'Hawks shouldna pick out hawks' een.
' You  are still a hawk, are you not?"    "Of course," she said, earnestly.
    "Well, then be leal to your brother hawks.
"    A cloud of perplexed thought stole over Erica's face.
 Raeburn noted it  and did his best to divert her attention.
    "Come," he said, "let us have a chapter of Mark Twain to enliven us.
"    But even Mark Twain was inadequate to check the thought-struggle which  had begun in Erica's brain.
 Desperate earnestness would not be conquered  even by the most delightful of all humorous fiction.
    During the next few days this thought-struggle raged.
 So great was  Erica's fear of having biased either one way or the other that she  would not even hint at her perplexity either to her father or to Charles  Osmond.
 And now the actual thoroughness of her character seemed a  hindrance.
    She had imagination, quick perception of the true and beautiful, and an  immense amount of steady common sense.
 At the same time she was almost  as keen and quite as slow of conviction as her father.
 Honestly dreading  to allow her poetic faculty due play, she kept her imagination rigidly  within the narrowest bounds.
 She was thus honestly handicapped in the  race; the honesty was, however, a little mistaken and one-sided, for  not the most vivid imagination could be considered as a set-off to the  great, the incalculable counter-influence of her whole education and  surroundings.
 How she got through that black struggle was sometimes  a mystery to her.
 At last, one evening, when the load had grown  intolerable, she shut herself into her own room, and, forgetful of all  her logical arguments, spoke to the unknown God.
 Her hopelessness,  her desperation, drove her as a last resource to cry to the possibly  Existent.
    She stood by the open window of her little room, with her arms on the  window sill, looking out into the summer night, just as years before  she had stood when making up her mind to exile and sacrifice.
 Then the  wintery heavens had been blacker and the stars brighter, now both sky  and stars were dimmer because more light.
 Over the roofs of the Guilford  Square houses she could see Charles' Wain and the Pole-star, but only  faintly.
    "God!" she cried, "I have no reason to think that Thou art except that  there is such fearful need of Thee.
 I can see no single proof in the  world that Thou art here.
 But if what Christ said was true, then Thou  must care that I should know Thee, for I must be Thy child.
 Oh, God, if  Thou art oh, Father, if Thou art help us to know Thee! Show us what is  true!"    She waited and waited, hoping for some sort of answer, some thought,  some conviction.
 But she found, as many have found before her, that "the  heavens were as brass.
"    "Of course it was no use!" she exclaimed, impatiently, yet with a  blankness of disappointment which in itself proved the reality of her  expectations.
    Just then she heard Tom's voice at the foot of the stairs calling; it  seemed like the seal to her impatient "of course.
" There was no Unseen,  no Eternal of course not! But there was a busy every-day life to be  lived.
    "All right," she returned impatiently, to Tom's repeated calls; "don't  make such a noise or else you'll disturb father.
"    "He is wide awake," said Tom, "and talking to the professor.
 Just look  here, I couldn't help fetching you down did you ever see such a speech  in your life? A regular brick he must be!"    He held an evening paper in his hand.
 Erica remembered that the  debate was to be on a question affecting all free-thinkers.
 During the  discussion of this, some one had introduced a reference to the Hyde  Park meeting and to Mr. Raeburn, and had been careful not to lose the  opportunity of making a spiteful and misleading remark about the apostle  of atheism.
 Tom hurried her through this, however, to the speech that  followed it.
    "Wait a minute," she said.
 "Who is Mr. Farrant? I never heard of him  before.
"    "Member for Greyshot, elected last spring, don't you remember? One of  the by-elections.
 Licked the Tories all to fits.
 This is his maiden  speech, and that makes it all the more plucky of him to take up the  cudgels in our defense.
 Here! Let me read it to you.
"    With the force of one who is fired with a new and hearty admiration, he  read the report.
 The speech was undoubtedly a fine one; it was a grand  protest against intolerance, a plea for justice.
 The speaker had  not hesitated for an instant to raise his voice in behalf of a very  unpopular cause, and his generous words, even when read through the  medium of an indifferent newspaper report, awoke a strange thrill in  Erica's heart.
 The utter disregard of self, the nobility of the whole  speech struck her immensely.
 The man who had dared to stand up for the  first time in Parliament and speak thus, must be one in a thousand.
  Presently came the most daring and disinterested touch of all.
    "The honorable member for Rilchester made what I can not but regard as  a most misleading and unnecessary remark with reference to the recent  occurrence in Hyde Park, and to Mr. Raeburn.
 I listened to it with pain,  for, if there can be degrees in the absolute evil of injustice and lack  of charity, it seems to me that the highest degree is reached in that  uncharitableness which tries to blacken the character of an opponent.
  Since the subject has been introduced, the House will, I hope, bear  with me if for the sake of justice I for a moment allude to a personal  matter.
 Some years ago I myself was an atheist, and I can only say that,  speaking now from the directly opposite standpoint, I can still look  back and thank Mr. Raeburn most heartily for the good service he did me.
  He was the first man who ever showed me, by words and example combined,  that life is only noble when lived for the race.
 The statement made by  the honorable member for Rilchester seems to me as incorrect as it was  uncalled for.
 Surely this assembly will best prove its high character  not by loud religious protestations, not by supporting a narrow,  Pharisaical measure, but by impartiality, by perfect justice, by the  manifestation in deed and word of that broad-hearted charity, that  universal brotherliness, which alone deserves the name of Christianity.
"    The manifestation of the speaker's generosity and universal  brotherliness came like a light to Erica's darkness.
 It did not end her  struggle, but it did end her despair.
 A faint, indefinable hope rose in  her heart.
    Mr. Farrant's maiden speech made a considerable stir; it met with some  praise and much blame.
 Erica learned from one of the papers that he  was Mr. Donovan Farrant, and at once felt convinced that he was the  "Donovan" whom both Charles Osmond and Brian had mentioned to her.
 She  seemed to know a good deal about him.
 Probably they had never told  her his surname because they knew that some day he would be a public  character.
 With instinctive delicacy she refrained from making any  reference to his speech, or any inquiry as to his identity with the  "Donovan" of whose inner life she had heard.
 Very soon after that, too,  she went down to the sea side with her father, and when they came back  to town the Osmonds had gone abroad, so it was not until the autumn that  they again met.
    Her stay at Codrington wonderfully refreshed her; it was the first time  in her life that she had taken a thorough holiday, with change of scene  and restful idleness to complete it.
 The time was outwardly uneventful  enough, but her father grew strong in body and she grew strong in mind.
    One absurd little incident she often laughed over afterward.
 It happened  that in the "On-looker" there was a quotation from some unnamed medieval  writer; she and her father had a discussion as to whom it could be,  Raeburn maintaining that it was Thomas a Kempis.
 Wishing to verify it,  Erica went to a bookseller's and asked for the "Imitation of Christ.
" A  rather prim-looking dame presided behind the counter.
    "We haven't that book, miss," she said, "it's quite out of fashion now.
"    "I agree with you," said Erica, greatly amused.
 "It must be quite out  of fashion, for I scarcely know half a dozen people who practice it.
"  However, a second shop appeared to think differently, for it had Thomas  a Kempis in every conceivable size, shape, and binding.
 Erica bought  a little sixpenny copy and went back to the beach, where she made her  father laugh over her story.
    They verified the quotation, and by and by Erica began to read the  book.
 On the very first page she came to words which made her pause and  relapse into a deep reverie.
    "But he who would fully and feelingly understand the words of Christ,  must study to make his whole life conformable to that of Christ.
"    The thought linked itself in her mind with some words of John Stuart  Mill's which she had heard quoted till she was almost weary of them.
    "Nor even now would it be easy, even for an unbeliever, to find a better  translation for the rule of virtue from the abstract into the concrete,  than to endeavor so to live that Christ would approve our life.
"    While she was still musing, a sound of piteous crying attracted her  notice.
 Looking up she saw a tiny child wandering along the beach,  trailing a wooden spade after her, and sobbing as if her heart would  break.
 In a moment Erica was beside her coaxing and consoling, but at  last, finding it impossible to draw forth an intelligible word from the  sobs and tears, she took the little thing in her arms and carried her to  her father.
 Raeburn was a great child lover, and had a habit of carrying  goodies in his pocket, much to the satisfaction of all the children with  whom he was brought in contact.
 He produced a bit of butterscotch, which  restored the small maiden's serenity for a minute.
    "She must have lost her way," he said, glancing from the lovely little  tear-stained face to the thinly shod feet and ungloved hands of  the little one.
 The butterscotch had won her heart.
 Presently she  volunteered a remark.
    "Dolly putted on her own hat.
 Dolly wanted to dig all alone.
 Dolly ran  away.
"    "Where is your home?" asked Erica.
    "Me don't know! Me don't know!" cried Dolly, bursting into tears again,  and hiding her face on Raeburn's coat.
 "Father! Father, Dolly wants  father.
"    "We will come and look for him," said Erica, "but you must stop crying,  and you know your father will be sure to come and look for you.
"    At this the little one checked her tears, and looked up as if expecting  to see him close by.
    "He isn't there," she said, piteously.
    "Come and let us look for him," said Erica.
    Dolly jumped up, thrust her little hand into Erica's, and toiled up the  steep beach.
 They had reached the road, and Erica paused for a moment,  wondering which direction they had better take, when a voice behind her  made her start.
    "Why Dorothy little one we've been hunting for you everywhere!"    Dolly let go Erica's hand, and with a glad cry rushed into the arms of  a tall, dark, rather foreign-looking man, who caught her up and held her  closely.
    He turned to Erica and thanked her very warmly for her help.
 Erica  thought his face the noblest she had ever seen.
        .
 At The Museum         Methought I heard one calling: "Child,"       And I replied: 'My Lord!'"       George Herbert    A favorite pastime with country children is to watch the gradual growth  of the acorn into the oak tree.
 They will suspend the acorn in a glass  of water and watch the slow progress during long months.
 First one tiny  white thread is put forth, then another, until at length the glass is  almost filled with a tangle of white fibers, a sturdy little stem  raises itself up, and the baby tree, if it is to live, must be at once  transplanted into good soil.
 The process may be botanically interesting,  but there is something a little sickly about it, too there is a feeling  that, after all, the acorn would have done better in its natural ground  hidden away in darkness.
    And, if we have this feeling with regard to vegetable growth, how much  more with regard to spiritual growth! To attempt to set up the gradually  awakening spirit in an apparatus where it might be the observed of all  observers would be at once repulsive and presumptuous.
 Happily, it is  impossible.
 We may trace influences and suggestions, just as we may note  the rain or drought, the heat or cold that affect vegetable growth, but  the actual birth is ever hidden.
    To attempt even to shadow forth Erica's growth during the next year  would be worse than presumptuous.
 As to her outward life it was not  greatly changed, only intensified.
 October always began their busiest  six months.
 There was the night school at which she was able to work  again indefatigably.
 There were lectures to be attended.
 Above all there  was an ever-increasing amount of work to be done for her father.
 In all  the positive and constructive side of secularism, in all the efforts  made by it to better humanity, she took an enthusiastic share.
 Naturally  she did not see so much of Charles Osmond now that she was strong again.
  In the press of business, in the hard, every-day life there was little  time for discussion.
 They met frequently, but never for one of their  long tete-a-tetes.
 Perhaps Erica purposely avoided them.
 She was  strangely different now from the little impetuous girl who had come to  his study years ago, trembling with anger at the lady superintendent's  insult.
 Insults had since then, alas, become so familiar to her, that  she had acquired a sort of patient dignity of endurance, infinitely sad  to watch in such a young girl.
    One morning in early June, just a year after the memorable Hyde Park  meeting, Charles Osmond happened to be returning from the death bed of  one of his parishioners when, at the corner of Guilford Square, he met  Erica.
 It might have been in part the contrast with the sad and painful  scene he had just quitted, but he thought she had never before looked so  beautiful.
 Her face seemed to have taken to itself the freshness and the  glow of the summer morning.
    "You are early abroad," he said, feeling older and grayer and more tired  than ever as he paused to speak to her.
    "I am off to the museum to read," she said, "I like to get there by  nine, then you don't have to wait such an age for your books; I can't  bear waiting.
"    "What are you at work upon now?"    "Oh, today for the last time I am going to hunt up particulars about  Livingstone.
 Hazeldine was very anxious that a series of papers on his  life should be written for our people.
 What a grand fellow he was!"    "I heard a characteristic anecdote of him the other day," said Charles  Osmond.
 "He was walking beside one of the African lakes which he had  discovered, when suddenly there dawned on him a new meaning to long  familiar words: 'The blood of Christ,' he exclaimed.
 'That must be  Charity! The blood of Christ that must be Charity!' A beautiful thought,  too seldom practically taught.
"    Erica looked grave.
    "Characteristic, certainly, of his broad-heartedness, but I don't think  that anecdote will do for the readers of the 'Idol-Breaker.
'" Then,  looking up at Charles Osmond, she added in a rather lower tone: "Do  you know, I had no idea when I began what a difficult task I had got.
 I  thought in such an active life as that there would be little difficulty  in keeping the religious part away from the secular, but it is wonderful  how Livingstone contrives to mix them up.
"    "You see, if Christianity be true, it must, as you say, 'mix up' with  everything.
 There should be no rigid distinction between secular and  religious," said Charles Osmond.
    "If it is true," said Erica, suddenly, and with seeming irrelevance,  "then sooner or later we must learn it to be so.
 Truth MUST win in the  end.
 But it is worse to wait for perfect certainty than for books at  the museum," she added, laughing.
 "It is five minutes to nine I shall be  late.
"    Charles Osmond walked home thoughtfully; the meeting had somehow cheered  him.
    "Absolute conviction that truth must out that truth must make itself  perceptible.
 I've not often come across a more beautiful faith than  that.
 Yes, little Undine, right you are.
 'Ye shall know the truth, and  the truth shall make you free.
' Here or there, here or there         'All things come round to him who will but wait.
'    There's one for yourself, Charles Osmond.
 None of your hurrying and  meddling now, old man; you've just got to leave it to your betters.
"    Soliloquizing after this fashion he reached home, and was not sorry to  find his breakfast awaiting him, for he had been up the greater part of  the night.
    The great domed library of the British Museum had become very home-like  to Erica, it was her ideal of comfort; she went there whenever she  wanted quiet, for in the small and crowded lodgings she could never be  secure from interruptions, and interruptions resulted in bad work.
 There  was something, too, in the atmosphere of the museum which seemed to help  her.
 She liked the perfect stillness, she liked the presence of all the  books.
 Above all, too, she liked the consciousness of possession.
 There  was no narrow exclusiveness about this place, no one could look askance  at her here.
 The place belonged to the people, and therefore belonged  to her; she heretic and atheist as she was had as much share in the  ownership as the highest in the land.
 She had her own peculiar nook over  by the encyclopedias, and, being always an early comer, seldom failed to  secure her own particular chair and desk.
    On this morning she took her place, as she had done hundreds of times  before, and was soon hard at work.
 She was finishing her last paper on  Livingstone when a book she had ordered was deposited on her desk by one  of the noiseless attendants.
 She wanted it to verify one or two dates,  and she half thought she would try to hunt up Charles Osmond's anecdote.
  In order to write her series of papers, she had been obliged to study  the character of the great explorer pretty thoroughly.
 She had always  been able to see the nobility even of those differing most widely  from herself in point of creed, and the great beauty of Livingstone's  character had impressed her very much.
 Today she happened to open on  an entry in his journal which seemed particularly characteristic of the  man.
 He was in great danger from the hostile tribes at the union of  the Zambesi and Loangwa, and there was something about his spontaneous  utterance which appealed very strongly to Erica.
    "Felt much turmoil of spirit in view of having all my plans for the  welfare of this great region and teeming population knocked on the head  by savages tomorrow.
 But I read that Jesus came and said: 'All power  is given unto me in Heaven and in earth.
 Go ye therefore and teach all  nations, and lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.
'  It is the word of a gentleman of the most sacred and strictest honor,  and there's an end on't.
 I will not cross furtively by night as I  intended.
.
.
 Nay, verily, I shall take observations for latitude and  longitude tonight, though they may be the last.
"    The courage, the daring, the perseverance, the intense faith of the man  shone out in these sentences.
 Was it indeed a delusion, such practical  faith as that?    Blackness of darkness seemed to hem her in.
 She struggled through it  once more by the one gleam of certainty which had come to her in the  past year.
 Truth must be self-revealing.
 Sooner or later, if she were  honest, if she did not shut her mind deliberately up with the assurance  "You have thought out these matters fully and fairly; enough! Let us  now rest content" and if she were indeed a true "Freethinker," she MUST  know.
 And even as that conviction returned to her the words half quaint,  half pathetic, came to her mind: "It is the word of a gentleman of the  most sacred and strictest honor, and there's an end on't.
"    Yes, there would "be an end on't," if she could feel sure that he, too,  was not deluded.
    She turned over the pages of the book, and toward the end found a copy  of the inscription on Livingstone's tomb.
 Her eye fell on the words:  "And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must  bring, and they shall hear My voice.
"    Somehow the mention of the lost sheep brought to her mind the little  lost child on the beach at Codrington Dolly, who had "putted on" her own  hat, who had wanted to be independent and to dig by herself.
 She had run  away from home, and could not find the way back.
 What a steep climb they  had had up the beach how the little thing's tiny feet had slipped and  stumbled over the stones, and just when they were most perplexed, the  father had found them.
    Exactly how it all came to her Erica never knew, nor could she ever put  into words the story of the next few moments.
 When "God's great sunrise"  finds us out we have need of something higher than human speech there  ARE no words for it.
 At the utmost she could only say that it was like  coming out of the twilight, that it seemed as if she were immersed in a  great wave of all pervading light.
    All in a moment the Christ who had been to her merely a noble character  of ancient history seemed to become to her the most real and living of  all living realities.
 Even her own existence seemed to fade into a  vague and misty shadow in comparison with the intensity of this new  consciousness this conviction of His being which surrounded her which  she knew, indeed, to be "way, and truth, and life.
 They shall hear  My voice.
" In the silence of waiting, in the faithfulness of honest  searching, Erica for the first time in her life heard it.
 Yes, she had  been right truth was self-revealing.
 A few minutes ago those words had  been to her an unfulfilled, a vain promise the speaker, broad-hearted  and loving as he was, had doubtless been deluded.
 But now the voice  spoke to her, called her by name, told her what she wanted.
    "Dolly," became to her a parable of life.
 She had been like that little  child; for years and years she had been toiling up over rough stones  and slippery pebbles, but at last she had heard the voice.
 Was this the  coming to the Father?    That which often appears sudden and unaccountable is, if we did but  know it, a slow, beautiful evolution.
 It was now very nearly seven years  since the autumn afternoon when the man "too nice to be a clergyman,"  and "not a bit like a Christian," had come to Erica's home, had shown  her that at least one of them practiced the universal brotherliness  which almost all preached.
 It was nearly seven years since words of  absolute conviction, words of love and power, had first sounded forth  from Christian lips in her father's lecture hall, and had awakened in  her mind that miserably uncomfortable question "supposing Christianity  should be true?"    All the most beautiful influences are quiet; only the destructive  agencies, the stormy wind, the heavy rain and hail, are noisy.
 Love of  the deepest sort is wordless, the sunshine steals down silently, the dew  falls noiselessly, and the communion of spirit with spirit is calmer and  quieter than anything else in the world quiet as the spontaneous turning  of the sunflower to the sun when the heavy clouds have passed away, and  the light and warmth reveal themselves.
 The subdued rustle of leaves,  the hushed footsteps sounded as usual in the great library, but Erica  was beyond the perception of either place or time.
    Presently she was recalled by the arrival of another student, who took  the chair next to hers a little deformed man, with a face which looked  prematurely old, and sad, restless eyes.
 A few hours before she would  have regarded him with a sort of shuddering compassion; now with the  compassion there came to her the thought of compensation which even here  and now might make the poor fellow happy.
 Was he not immortal? Might he  not here and now learn what she had just learned, gain that unspeakable  joy? And might not the knowledge go on growing and increasing forever?  She took up her pen once more, verified the dates, rolled up her  manuscript, and with one look at Livingstones's journal, returned it to  the clerk and left the library.
    It was like coming into a new world; even dingy Bloomsbury seemed  beautiful.
 Her face was so bright, so like the face of a happy child,  that more than one passer-by was startled by it, lifted for a moment  from sordid cares into a purer atmosphere.
 She felt a longing to speak  to some one who would understand her new happiness.
 She had reached  Guilford Square, and looked doubtfully across to the Osmonds' house.
  They would understand.
 But no she must tell her father first.
 And then,  with a fearful pang, she realized what her new conviction meant.
 It  meant bringing the sword into her father's house; it meant grieving him  with a life-long grief; it meant leaving the persecuted minority and  going over to the triumphant majority; it meant unmitigated pain to all  those she loved best.
    Erica had had her full share of pain, but never had she known anything  so agonizing as that moment's sharp revulsion.
 Mechanically she walked  on until she reached home; nobody was in.
 She looked into the little  sitting room but, only Friskarina sat purring on the rug.
 The table  was strewn with the Saturday papers; the midday post had just come.
  She turned over the letters and found one for herself in her father's  handwriting.
 It was the one thing needed to complete the realization  of her pain.
 She snatched it up with a stifled sob, ran upstairs to her  room, and threw herself down on the bed in silent agony.
    A new joy had come to her which her father could not share; a joy which  he would call a delusion, which he spent a great part of his life  in combating.
 To tell him that she was convinced of the truth of  Christianity why, it would almost break his heart.
    And yet she must inflict this terrible pain.
 Her nature was far too  noble to have dreamed for a single instant of temporizing, of keeping  her thoughts to herself.
 A Raeburn was not likely to fail either in  courage or in honesty; but with her courage and honesty, Erica had the  violin-like sensitiveness of nature which Eric Haeberlein had noticed  even in her childhood.
 She saw in the future all the pain she must bring  to her father, intensified by her own sensitiveness.
 She knew so well  what her feelings would have been but a short time ago, if any one she  greatly loved had "fallen back" into Christianity.
 How could she tell  him? How COULD she!    Yet it was a thing which must be done.
 Should she write to him? No, the  letter might reach him when he was tired and worried yet, to speak would  be more painful.
    She got up and went to the window, and let the summer wind blow on her  heated forehead.
 The world had seemed to her just before one glorious  presence-chamber full of sunshine and rejoicing.
 But already the shadow  of a life-long pain had fallen on her heart.
 A revealed Christ meant  also a revealed cross, and a right heavy one.
    It was only by degrees that she grew strong again, and Livingstone's  text came back to her once more, "I am with you always.
"    By and by she opened her father's letter.
 It ran as follows:    "I have just remembered that Monday will be your birthday.
 Let us spend  it together, little son Erica.
 A few days at Codrington would do us  both good, and I have a tolerably leisure week.
 If you can come down on  Saturday afternoon, so much the better.
 I will meet you there, if you  will telegraph reply as soon as you get this.
 I have three lectures at  Helmstone on Sunday, but you will probably prefer a quiet day by the  sea.
 Bring me Westcott's new book, and you might put in the chisel and  hammer.
 We will do a little geologizing for the professor, if we have  time.
 Meeting here last night a great success.
 Your loving father, Luke  Raeburn.
"    "He is only thinking how he can give me pleasure," sighed Erica.
 "And I  have nothing to give him but pain.
"    She went at once, however, for the "Bradshaw," and looked out the  afternoon trains to Codrington.
        .
 Storm         And seems she mid deep silence to a strain       To listen, which the soul alone can know,       Saying: "Fear naught, for Jesus came on earth,       Jesus of endless joys the wide, deep sea,       To ease each heavy load of mortal birth.
       His waters ever clearest, sweetest be       To him who in a lonely bark drifts forth       On His great deeps of goodness trustfully.
"       From Vittoria Colonna    Codrington was one of the very few sea-side places within fairly easy  reach of London which had not been vulgarized into an ordinary watering  place.
 It was a primitive little place with one good, old-established  hotel, and a limited number of villas and lodging houses, which only  served as a sort of ornamental fringe to the picturesque little fishing  town.
    The fact was that it was just midway between two large and deservedly  popular resorts, and so it had been overlooked, and to the regret of the  thrifty inhabitants and the satisfaction of the visitors who came there  for quiet, its peaceful streets and its stony beach were never invaded  by excursionists.
 No cockneys came down for the Sunday to eat shrimps;  the shrimps were sent away by train to the more favored watering places,  and the Codrington shop keepers shook their heads and gave up expecting  to make a fortune in such a conservative little place.
 Erica said it  reminded her of the dormouse in "Alice In Wonderland," tyrannized  over by the hatter on one side and the March hare on the other, and  eventually put head foremost into the teapot.
 Certainly Helmstone on the  east and Westport on the west had managed to eclipse it altogether, and  its peaceful sleepiness made the dormouse comparison by no means inapt.
    It all looked wonderfully unchanged as she walked from the station that  summer afternoon with her father.
 The square, gray tower of St.
 Oswald's  Church, the little, winding, irregular streets, the very shop windows  seemed quite unaltered, while at every turn familiar faces came into  sight.
 The shrewd old sailor with the telescope, the prim old lady at  the bookseller's, who had pronounced the "Imitation of Christ" to be  quite out of fashion, the sturdy milkman, with white smock-frock, and  bright pails fastened to a wooden yoke, and the coast-guardsman, who was  always whistling "Tom Bowling.
"    The sea was as calm as a mill pond; Raeburn suggested an hour or two on  the water and Erica, who was fond of boating, gladly assented.
 She had  made up her ind not to speak to her father that evening; he had a very  hard day's work before him on the Sunday; they must have these few hours  in peace.
 She did not in the least dread any subject coming up which  might put her into difficulty, for, on the rare days when her father  allowed himself any recreation, he entirely banished all controversial  topics from his mind.
 He asked no single question relating to the work  or to business of any kind, but gave himself up to the enjoyment of a  much-needed rest and relaxation.
 He seemed in excellent spirits, and  Erica herself would have been rapturously happy if she had not been  haunted by the thought of the pain that awaited him.
 She knew that this  was the last evening she and her father should ever spend together in  the old perfect confidence; division the most painful of all divisions  lay before them.
    The next day she was left to herself.
 She would not go to the old  gray-towered church, though as an atheist she had gone to one or two  churches to look and listen, she felt that she could not honorably go as  a worshiper till she had spoken to her father.
 So she wandered about on  the shore, and in the restful quiet learned more and grew stronger, and  conquered the dread of the morrow.
 She did not see her father again that  day for he could not get back from Helmstone till a late train, and she  had promised not to sit up for him.
    The morning of her twenty-third birthday was bright and sunshiny; she  had slept well, but awoke with the oppressive consciousness that a  terrible hard duty lay before her.
 When she came down there was  a serious look in her eyes which did not escape Raeburn's keen  observation.
 He was down before her, and had been out already, for he  had managed somehow to procure a lovely handful of red and white roses  and mignonette.
    "All good wishes for your birthday, and 'sweets to the sweet' as some  one remarked on a more funereal occasion," he said, stooping to kiss  her.
 "Dear little son Eric, it is very jolly to have you to myself for  once.
 No disrespect to Aunt Jean and old Tom, but two is company.
" "What  lovely flowers!" exclaimed Erica.
 "How good of you! Where did they come  from?"    "I made love to old Nicolls, the florist, to let me gather these myself;  he was very anxious to make a gorgeous arrangement done up in white  paper with a lace edge, and thought me a fearful Goth for preferring  this disorderly bunch.
"    They sat down to breakfast; afterward the morning papers came in, and  Raeburn disappeared behind the "Daily Review," while the servant cleared  the table.
 Erica stood by the open French window; she knew that in a few  minutes she must speak, and how to get what she had to say into words  she did not know.
 Her heart beat so fast that she felt almost choked.
 In  a sort of dream of pain she watched the passers-by happy looking girls  going down to bathe, children with spades and pails.
 Everything seemed  so tranquil, so ordinary while before her lay a duty which must change  her whole world.
    "Not much news," said Raeburn, coming toward her as the servant left the  room.
 "For dullness commend me to a Monday paper! Well, Eric, how are  we to spend your twenty-third birthday? To think that I have actually  a child of twenty-three! Why, I ought to feel an old patriarch, and, in  spite of white hair and life-long badgering, I don't, you know.
 Come,  what shall we do.
 Where would you like to go?"    "Father," said Erica, "I want first to have a talk with you.
 I--I have  something to tell you.
"    There was no longer any mistaking that the seriousness meant some kind  of trouble.
 Raeburn put his arm round her.
    "Why, my little girl," he said, tenderly.
 "You are trembling all over.
  What is the matter?"    "The matter is that what I have to say will pain you, and it half kills  me to do that.
 But there is no choice tell you I must.
 You would not  wish me not to be true, not to be honest.
"    Utter perplexity filled Raeburn's mind.
 What phantom trouble was  threatening him? Had she been commissioned to tell him of some untoward  event? Some business calamity? Had she fallen in love with some one he  could not permit her to marry? He looked questioningly at her, but her  expression only perplexed him still more; she was trembling no longer,  and her eyes were clear and bright, there was a strong look about her  whole face.
    "Father," she said, quietly, "I have learned to believe in Jesus  Christ.
"    He wrenched away his arm; he started back from her as if she had stabbed  him.
 For a minute he looked perfectly dazed.
    At last, after a silence which seemed to each of them age-long, he spoke  in the agitated voice of one who has just received a great blow.
    "Do you know what you are saying, Erica? Do you know what such a  confession as you have made will involve? Do you mean that you accept  the whole of Christ's teaching?    "Yes," she replied, firmly, "I do.
"    "You intend to turn Christian?"    "Yes, to try to.
"    "How long have you and Mr. Osmond been concocting this?"    "I don't know what you mean," said Erica, terribly wounded by his tone.
    "Did he send you down here to tell me?"    "Mr. Osmond knows nothing about it," said Erica.
 "How could I tell any  one before you, father?"    Raeburn was touched by this.
 He took several turns up and down the room  before speaking again, but the more he grasped the idea the deeper grew  his grief and the hotter his anger.
 He was a man of iron will, however,  and he kept both under.
 When at length he did speak, his voice was quiet  and cold and repressed.
    "Sit down," he said, motioning her to a chair.
 "This is not a subject  that we can dismiss in five minutes' talk.
 I must hear your reasons.
 We  will put aside all personal considerations.
 I will consider you just as  an ordinary opponent.
"    His coldness chilled her to the heart.
 Was it always to be like this?  How could she possibly endure it? How was she to answer his questions  how was she to vindicate her faith when the mere tone of his voice  seemed to paralyze her heart? He was indeed treating her with the cold  formality of an opponent, but never for a single instant could she  forget that he was her father the being she loved best in the whole  world.
    But Erica was brave and true; she knew that this was a crisis in their  lives, and, thrusting down her own personal pain, she forced herself to  give her whole heart and mind to the searching and perplexing questions  with which her father intended to test the reality of her convictions.
  Had she been unaccustomed to his mode of attack he would have hopelessly  silenced her, as far as argument goes in half an hour; but not only was  Erica's faith perfectly real, but she had, as it were, herself traversed  the whole of his objections and difficulties.
 Though far from imagining  that she understood everything, she had yet so firmly grasped the  innermost truth that all details as yet outside her vision were to her  no longer hindrances and bugbears, but so many new possibilities other  hopes of fresh manifestations of God.
    She held her ground well, and every minute Raeburn realized more keenly  that whatever hopes he had entertained of reconvincing her were futile.
  What made it all the more painful to him was that the thoroughness  of the training he had given her now only told against him, and the  argument which he carried on in a cold, metallic voice was really  piercing his very heart, for it was like arguing against another self,  the dearest part of himself gone over to the enemy's side.
    At last he saw that argument was useless, and then, in his grief and  despair, he did for a time lose his self-control.
 Erica had often felt  sorry for the poor creatures who had to bear the brunt of her father's  scathing sarcasm.
 But platform irony was a trifle to the torrent which  bore down upon her today.
 When a strong man does lose his restraint upon  himself, the result is terrific.
 Raeburn had never sufficiently  cared for an adversary as to be moved beyond an anger which could be  restricted and held within due bounds; he of course cared more for the  success of his cause and his own dignity.
 But now his love drove him to  despair; his intolerable grief at the thought of having an opponent in  his own child burst all restraining bonds.
 Wounded to the quick, he who  had never in his life spoken a harsh word to his child now poured forth  such a storm of anger, and sarcasm, and bitter reproach, as might have  made even an uninterested by-stander tremble.
    Had Erica made any appeal, had she even begun to cry, his chivalry would  have been touched; he would have recognized her weakness, and regained  his self control.
 But she was not weak, she was strong she was his other  self gone over to the opposite side; that was what almost maddened him.
  The torrent bore down upon her, and she spoke not a word, but just  sat still and endured.
 Only, as the words grew more bitter and more  wounding, her lips grew white, her hands were locked more tightly  together.
 At last it ended.
    "You have cheated yourself into this belief," said Raeburn, "you have  given me the most bitter grief and disappointment of my whole life.
 Have  you anything else you wish to say to me?"    "Nothing," replied Erica, not daring to venture more; for, if she had  tried to speak, she knew she must have burst into tears.
    But there was as much pain expressed in her voice as she spoke that one  word as there had been in all her father's outburst.
 It appealed to  him at once.
 He said no more, but stepped out of the French window, and  began to pace to an fro under the veranda.
    Erica did not stir; she was like one crushed.
 Sad and harassed as  her life had been, it yet seemed to her that she had never known such  indescribably bitter pain.
 The outside world looked bright and sunshiny;  she could see the waves breaking on the shore, while beyond, sailing  out into the wide expanse was a brown-sailed fishing boat.
 Every now  and then her vision was interrupted by a tall, dark figure pacing to  and fro; every now and then the sunlight glinted on snow-white hair, and  then a fresh stab of pain awoke in her heart.
    The brown-sailed fishing boat dwindled into a tiny dark spot on the  horizon, the sea tossed and foamed and sparked in the sunshine.
 Erica  turned away; she could not bear to look at it, for just now it seemed to  her merely the type of the terrible separation which had arisen between  herself and her father.
 She felt as if she were being borne away in the  little fishing boat, while he was left on the land, and the distance  between them slowly widened and widened.
    All through that grievous conversation she had held in her hand a little  bit of mignonette.
 She had held it unconsciously; it was withered  and drooping, its sweetness seemed to her now sickly and hateful.
 She  identified it with her pain, and years after the smell of mignonette was  intolerable to her.
 She would have thrown it away, but remembered that  her father had given it her.
 And then, with the recollection of her  birthday gift, came the realization of all the long years of unbroken  and perfect love, so rudely interrupted today.
 Was it always to be like  this? Must they drift further and further apart?    Her heart was almost breaking; she had endured to the very uttermost,  when at length comfort came.
 The sword had only come to bring the higher  peace.
 No terrible sea of division could part those whom love could bind  together.
 The peace of God stole once more into her heart.
    "How loud soe'er the world may roar, We know love will be conqueror.
"    Meanwhile Raeburn paced to and fro in grievous pain The fact that his  pain could scarcely perhaps have been comprehended by the generality of  people did not make it less real or less hard to bear.
 A really honest  atheist, who is convinced that Christianity is false and misleading,  suffers as much at the sight of what he considers a mischievous belief  as a Christian would suffer while watching a service in some heathen  temple.
 Rather his pain would be greater, for his belief in the gradual  progress of his creed is shadowy and dim compared with the Christian's  conviction that the "Saviour of all men" exists.
    Once, some years before, a very able man, one of his most devoted  followers, had "fallen back" into Christianity.
 That had been a bitter  disappointment; but that his own child whom he loved more than anything  in the world, should have forsaken him and gone over to the enemy, was a  grief well-nigh intolerable.
 It was a grief he had never for one moment  contemplated.
    Could anything be more improbable than that Erica, carefully trained as  she had been, should relapse so strangely? Her whole life had been spent  among atheists; there was not a single objection to Christianity which  had not been placed before her.
 She had read much, thought much; she had  worked indefatigably to aid the cause.
 Again and again she had  braved personal insult and wounding injustice as an atheist.
 She had  voluntarily gone into exile to help her father in his difficulties.
  Through the shameful injustice of a Christian, she had missed the last  years of her mother's life, and had been absent from her death bed.
  She had borne on behalf of her father's cause a thousand irritating  privations, a thousand harassing cares; she had been hard-working, and  loyal, and devoted; and now all at once she had turned completely round  and placed herself in the opposing ranks!    Raeburn had all his life been fighting against desperate odds, and in  the conflict he had lost well-nigh everything.
 He had lost his home long  ago, he had lost his father's good will, he had lost the whole of his  inheritance; he had lost health, and strength, and reputation, and  money; he had lost all the lesser comforts of life; and now he said to  himself that he was to lose his dearest treasure of all, his child.
    Bitter, hopeless, life-long division had arisen between them.
 For  twenty-three years he had loved her as truly as ever father loved child,  and this was his reward! A miserable sense of isolation arose in his  heart.
 Erica had been so much to him how could he live without her? The  muscles of his face quivered with emotion; he clinched his hands almost  fiercely.
    Then he tortured himself by letting his thoughts wander back to the  past.
 That very day years ago, when he had first learned what fatherhood  meant; the pride of watching his little girl as the years rolled on;  the terrible anxiety of one long and dangerous illness she had passed  through how well he remembered the time! They were very poor, could  afford no expensive luxuries; he had shared the nursing with his wife.
  One night he remembered toiling away with his pen while the sick child  was actually on his knee; he always fancied that the pamphlet he had  then been at work on was more bitterly sarcastic than anything he had  ever written.
 Then on once more into years of desperately hard work and  disappointingly small results, imbittered by persecution, crippled by  penalties and never-ending litigation; but always there had been the  little child waiting for him at home, who by her baby-like freedom from  care could make him smile when he was overwhelmed with anxiety.
 How  could he ever have endured the bitter obloquy, the slanderous attacks,  the countless indignities which had met him on all sides, if there had  not been one little child who adored him, who followed him about like a  shadow, who loved him and trusted him utterly?    Busy as his life had been, burdened as he had been for years with twice  as much work as he could get through, the child had never been crowded  out of his life.
 Even as a little thing of four years old, Erica  had been quite content to sit on the floor in his study by the hour  together, quietly amusing herself by cutting old newspapers into  fantastic shapes, or by drawing impossible cats and dogs and horses on  the margins.
 She had never disturbed him; she used to talk to herself in  whispers.
    "Are you happy, little one?" he used to ask from time to time, with  a sort of passionate desire that he should enjoy her unconscious  childhood, foreseeing care and trouble for her in the future.
    "Yes, very happy," had been the invariable response; and generally Erica  would avail herself of the interruption to ask his opinion about some  square-headed cat, with eyes askew and an astonishing number of legs,  which she had just drawn.
 Then would come what she called a "bear's  hug," after which silence reigned again in the study, while Raeburn  would go on writing some argumentative pamphlet, hard and clear as  crystal, his heart warmed by the little child's love, the remains of a  smile lingering about his lips at the recollection of the square-headed  cat.
    And the years passed on, and every year deepened and strengthened their  love.
 And by slow degrees he had watched the development of her mind;  had gloried in her quick perception, had learned to come to her for a  second opinion every now and then; had felt proud of her common sense,  her thoughtful judgments; had delighted in her enthusiastic, loving  help.
 All this was ended now.
 Strange that, just as he hoped most from  her, she should fail him! It was a repetition of his own early history  exactly reversed.
 His thoughts went back to his father's study in  the old Scottish parsonage.
 He remembered a long, fierce argument; he  remembered a storm of abusive anger, and a furious dismissal from the  house.
 The old pain came back to him vividly.
    "And she loves me fifty thousand times more than I ever loved my  father," he reflected.
 "And, though I was not abusive, I was hard on  her.
 And, however mistaken, she was very brave, very honest.
 Oh, I was  cruel to her harsh, and hateful! My little child! My poor little child!  It shall not it cannot divide us.
 I am hers, and she is mine nothing can  ever alter that.
"    He turned and went back into the room.
 Never had he looked grander  than at that minute; this man who could hold thousands in breathless  attention this man who was more passionately loved by his friends, more  passionately hated by his enemies than almost any man in England! He was  just the ideal father.
    Erica had not stirred, she was leaning back in her chair, looking very  still and white.
 He came close to her.
    "Little son Eric!" he said, with a whole world of love in his tone.
    She sprang up and wreathed her arms round his neck.
    By and by, they began to talk in low tones, to map out and piece  together as well as they could the future life, which was inevitably  severed from the past by a deep gulf.
 They spoke of the work which they  could still share, of the interests they should still have in common.
 It  was very sad work for Erica infinitely sadder for Raeburn; but they were  both of them brave and noble souls, and they loved each other, and so  could get above the sadness.
 One thing they both agreed upon.
 They would  never argue about their opinions.
 They would, as far as possible, avoid  any allusion to the grave differences that lay between them.
    Late in the afternoon, a little group of fishermen and idlers stood  on the beach.
 They were looking out seaward with some "anxiety, for a  sudden wind had arisen, and there was what they called 'an ugly sea.
'"    "I tell you it was madness to let 'em go alone on such a day," said the  old sailor with the telescope.
    "And I tell you that the old gentleman pulls as good an oar as any of  us," retorted another man, in a blue jersey and a sou'wester.
    "Old gentleman, indeed!" broke in the coast guardsman.
 "Better say  devil at once! Why, man alive! Your old gentleman is Luke Raeburn, the  atheist.
"    "God forbid!" exclaimed the first speaker, lowering his telescope for a  moment.
 "Why, he be mighty friendly to us fishermen.
"    "Where be they now, gaffer? D'ye see them?" asked a keen-looking lad of  seventeen.
    "Ay, there they be! There they be! God have mercy on 'em! They'll be  swamped sure as fate!"    The coast guardsman, with provoked sang-froid and indifference, began to  sing:    "For though his body's under hatches, His soul is gone alo-o-ft.
"    And then breaking off into a sort of recitative.
    "Which is exactly the opposite quarter to what Luke Raeburn's soul will  go, I guess.
"    "Blowed if I wouldn't pull an oar to save a mate, if I were so mighty  sure he was going to the devil!" observed a weather-beaten seaman, with  gold earrings and a good deal of tattooing on his brawny arms.
    "Would you now!" said the coast guardsman, with a superior and sardonic  smile.
 "Well, in my 'umble opinion, drowning's too good for him.
"    With which humane utterance, the coast guardsman walked off, singing of  Tom who         "Never from his word departed,       Whose heart was kind and soft.
"    "Well, I, for one, will lend a hand to help them.
 Now then, mates! Which  of you is going to help to cheat the devil of his due?" said the man  with the earrings.
    Three men proffered their services, but the old seaman with the  telescope checked them.
    "Bide a bit, mates, bide a bit; I'm not sure you've a call to go.
" He  wiped the glasses of his telescope with a red handkerchief, and then  looked out seaward once more.
    In the meantime, while their fate was being discussed on the shore,  Raeburn and Erica were face to face with death.
 They were a long way  from land before the wind had sprung up so strongly.
 Raeburn, who in his  young days had been at once the pride and anxiety of the fishermen round  his Scottish home, and noted for his readiness and daring, had now lost  the freshness of his experience, and had grown forgetful of weather  tokens.
 The danger was upon them before he had even thought of it.
 The  strong wind blowing upon them, the delicious salt freshness, even  the brisk motion, had been such a relief to them after the pain and  excitement of the morning.
 But all at once they began to realize that  their peril was great.
 Their little boat tossed so fearfully that Erica  had to cling to the seat for safety; one moment they were down in the  hollow of a deep green wave, the next they would be tossed up upon its  crest as though their boat had been a mere cockle shell.
    "I'm afraid we've made a mistake, Eric," said Raeburn.
 "I ought to have  seen this storm coming up.
"    "What?" cried Erica, for the dashing of the waves made the end of the  sentence inaudible.
    He looked across the boat at her, and an almost paralyzing dread filled  his heart.
 For himself he could be brave, for himself death had no  terrors but for his child!    A horrible vision rose before him.
 He saw her lying stiff and cold,  with glazed eyes and drenched hair.
 Was there to be a yet more terrible  separation between them? Was death to snatch her from him? Ah, no that  should never be! They would at least go down together.
    The vision faded; he saw once more the fair, eager face, no longer  pallid, but flushed with excitement, the brave eyes clear and bright,  but somewhat anxious.
 The consciousness that everything depended on him  helped him to rise above that overmastering horror.
 He was once more his  strongest self.
    The rudder had been left on the beach, and it was only possible to steer  by the oars.
 He dismissed even the thought of Erica, and concentrated  his whole being on the difficult task before him.
 So grand did he look  in that tremendous endeavor that Erica almost forgot her anxiety; there  was something so forceful in his whole aspect that she could not be  afraid.
 Her heart beat quickly indeed, but the consciousness of danger  was stimulating.
    Yet the waves grew more and more furious, rolling, curling, dashing up  in angry, white foam "raging horribly.
" At length came one which broke  right over the little boat, blinding and drenching its occupants.
    "Another like that will do for us," Said Raeburn, in a quiet voice.
    The boat was half full of water.
 Erica began to bale out with her  father's hat, and each knew from the other's face that their plight was  hopeless.
    Raeburn had faced death many times.
 He had faced it more than once on a  sick bed, he had faced it surrounded by yelling and furious mobs, but he  had never faced it side by side with his child.
 Again he looked at the  angry gray-green waves, at the wreaths of curling white foam, again that  awful vision rose before him, and, brave man as he was, he shuddered.
    Life was sweet even though he was harassed, persecuted, libeled.
 Life  was sweet even though his child had deserted his cause, even though she  had "cheated herself into a belief.
" Life was infinitely worth  living, mere existence an exquisite joy, blank nothingness a hideous  alternative.
    "Bale out!" he cried, despair in his eyes, but a curve of resoluteness  about his lips.
    A few more strokes warily pulled, another huge wave sweeping along,  rearing itself up, dashing down upon them.
 The boat reeled and  staggered.
 To struggle longer was useless.
 Raeburn threw his oars  inboard, caught hold of Erica, and held her fast.
 When they could see  once more, they found the boat quite three parts full.
    "Child!" he said, "child!" But nothing more would come.
 For once in his  life words failed him; the orator was speechless.
 Was it a minute or an  eternity that he waited there through that awful pause waited with his  arm round Erica, feeling the beating of her heart, the heart which must  soon cease beating forever, feeling her warm breath on his cheek alas!  How few more breaths would she draw! How soon would the cold water grave  close over all that he--    His thoughts were abruptly checked.
 That eternal minute of waiting was  over.
 It was coming death was coming riding along with mocking scorn  on the crest of a giant wave.
 Higher and higher rose the towering,  sea-green wall, mockingly it rushed forward, remorselessly swooped down  upon them! This time the boat was completely swamped.
    "I will at least die fighting!" thought Raeburn, a despairing, defiant  courage inspiring him with almost superhuman strength.
    "Trust to me!" he cried.
 "Don't struggle!" And Erica who would naturally  have fallen into that frantic and vain convulsion which seizes most  people when they find themselves in peril of drowning, by a supreme  effort of will made no struggle at all, but only clung to her father.
    Raeburn was a very strong man, and an expert swimmer, but it was a  fearful sea.
 They were dashed hither and thither, they were buffeted,  and choked, and blinded, but never once did he lose his presence of  mind.
 Every now and then he even shouted out a few words to Erica.
 How  strange his voice sounded in that chaos, in that raging symphony of  winds and waves.
    "Tell me when you can't hold any longer," he cried.
    "I can't leave go," returned Erica.
    And even then, in that desperate minute, they both felt a momentary  thrill of amusement.
 The fact was, that her effort of will had been so  great when she had obeyed him, and clung with all her might to him, that  now the muscles of her hands absolutely would not relax their hold.
    It seemed endless! Over the cold green and white of the waves Raeburn  seemed to see his whole life stretched out before him, in a series  of vivid pictures.
 All the long struggles, all the desperate fights  wreathed themselves out in visions round this supreme death struggle.
  And always there was the consciousness that he was toiling for Erica's  life, struggling, agonizing, straining every fiber of his being to save  her.
    But what was this paralyzing cold creeping over his limbs? What this  pressure at his heart? This dimness of his eyes? Oh! Was his strength  failing him? Was the last hope, indeed, gone? Panting, he struggled on.
    "I will do thirty more strokes!" he said to himself.
 And he did them.
    "I will do ten more!"    And he forced himself to keep on.
    "Ten more!"    He was gasping now.
 Erica's weight seemed to be dragging him down, down,  into nothingness.
    Six strokes painfully made! Seven! After all nothingness would mean  rest.
 Eight! No pain to either, since they were together.
 Nine! He  should live on in the hearts of his people.
 Ten! Agony of failure! He  was beaten at last!    What followed they neither of them knew, only there was a shout, an  agony of sinking, a vision of a dark form and a something solid which  they grasped convulsively.
    When Erica came to herself they were by no means out of danger, but  there was something between them and the angry sea.
 She was lying down  at the bottom of a boat in close proximity to some silvery-skinned  fishes, and her father was holding her hand.
    Wildly they tossed for what seemed to her a very long time; but at  length fresh voices were heard, the keel grated on the shore, she felt  herself lifted up and carried on to the beach.
 Then, with an effort,  she stood up once more, trembling and exhausted, but conscious that mere  existence was rapture.
    Raeburn paused to reward and thank the men who had rescued them in his  most genial manner, and Erica's happiness would have been complete had  not the coast guardsman stepped up in an insolent and officious way, and  observed:    "It is a pity, Mr. Luke Raeburn, that you don't bring yourself to offer  thanks to God almighty!"    "Sir," replied Raeburn, "when I ask your opinion of my personal and  private matters, it will be fitting that you should speak not before!"    The man looked annihilated, and turned away.
    Raeburn grasped the rough hands of his helpers and well-wishers, gave  his arm to Erica, and led her up the steep beach.
    Later on in the evening they sat over the fire, and talked over their  adventure.
 June though it was, they had both been thoroughly chilled.
    "What did you think of when we were in the water?' asked Erica.
    "I made a deep calculation," said Raeburn, smiling, "and found that the  sale of the plant and of all my books would about clear off the last of  the debts, and that I should die free.
 After that I thought of Cicero's  case of the two wise men struggling in the sea with one plank to rescue  them sufficient only for one.
 They were to decide which of their lives  was most useful to the republic, and the least useful man was to drop  down quietly into the deep.
 It struck me that you and I should hardly  come to such a calculation.
 I think we would have gone down together,  little one! What did you think of?"    But Erica's thoughts could not so easily be put into words.
    "For one thing," she said, "I thought we should never be divided any  more.
"    She sighed a little; for, after all, the death they had so narrowly  escaped would have been so infinitely easier than the life which lay  before her.
    "Clearly we are inseparable!" said Raeburn.
 "In that sense, little son  Eric, we can still say, 'We fear nae foe!'"    Perhaps the gentle words, and the sadness which he could not entirely  banish from his tone, moved Erica almost more than his passionate  utterances in the morning.
    The day was no bad miniature of her whole life.
 Very sad, very happy,  full of danger, conflict and strife, warmed by outside sympathy, wounded  by outside insolence.
        .
 What it Involved         Stronger than steel       Is the sword of the spirit;       Swifter than arrows       The life of the truth is;       Greater than anger       Is love,  and subdueth.
  Longfellow    The two or three days at Codrington lengthened out into a week, for both  Raeburn and Erica felt a good deal exhausted after the eventful Monday.
  Raeburn, anxious to spare her as much as possible, himself wrote to Mrs.  Craigie, and told her of Erica's change of views.
    "It is a great grief," he wrote, "and she will be a serious loss to our  cause, but I am determined that we will not enact over again the course  of action which drove both you and me from home.
 Odd! That she should  just reverse our story! Anyhow, you and I, Jean, have been too much  persecuted to turn into persecutors.
 The child is as much in earnest for  her delusion as we for our truth.
 Argument and remonstrance will do no  good, and you must understand, and make Tom understand, that I'll not  have her bullied.
 Don't think that I am trying to make her mistaken way  all easy for her.
 She won't find it easy.
 She will have a miserable time  of it with our own set, and how many Christians, do you imagine, will  hold out a hand to Luke Raeburn's daughter, even though her views have  changed? Maybe half a dozen! Not more, I fancy, unless she renounced us  with atheism, and that she never will do! She will be between two fires,  and I believe between the two she will be worried to death in a year  unless we can keep the peace at home.
 I don't blame Osmond for this,  though at first I did suspect it was his doing; but this has been no  cram-work.
 Erica has honestly faced the questions herself, and has  honestly arrived at this mistaken conclusion.
 Osmond's kindness and  generosity of course influenced her, but for the rest they have only had  the free discussions of which from the first I approved.
 Years ago he  said to me plainly, 'What if she should see reasons to change her mind?'  I scouted the notion then, it seemed and still seems almost INCREDIBLE.
  He has, you see, acted quite honorably.
 It is Erica's own doing.
 I  remember telling him that our name of freethinkers was a reality, and  so it shall still be! She shall be free to think the untrue is true;  she shall be free to confess herself a Christian before the whole world,  though it deal me the hardest of blows.
"    This letter soon spread the news.
 Aunt Jean was too much vexed and not  deeply grieved enough to keep silence.
 Vexation finds some relief in  talking, deep grief as a rule prefers not to speak.
 Tom, in his odd way,  felt the defection of his favorite cousin as much as anybody, except  Raeburn himself.
 They had been play-fellows, they had always been like  brother and sister together, and he was astounded to think that Erica,  of all people in the world, should have deserted the cause.
 The letter  had come by one of the evening posts.
 He went out and paced up and down  the square in the soft midsummer twilight, trying to realize the facts  of the case.
 Presently he heard rapid steps behind him; no one walked  at that pace excepting Brian, and Tom was quite prepared to feel an arm  link itself within his.
    "Hallo, old fellow!" exclaimed Brian.
 "Moonlight meditations?"    "Where did you drop from?" said Tom, evasively.
    "Broken leg, round the corner a public-house row.
 What brutes men are!"  exclaimed the young doctor, hotly.
    "Disappointing world altogether," said Tom with a sigh.
 "What do you  think we have just heard about Erica?"    Brian's heart almost stopped beating; he hardly knew what he feared.
    "How can I tell?" he answered, hoarsely.
 "No bad news, I hope?"    "She's gone and turned Christian," said Tom, in a tone of deep disgust.
    Brian started.
    "Thank God!" he exclaimed, under his breath.
    "Confound it!" cried Tom.
 "I'd forgot you'd be triumphant.
 Good night,"  and he marched off in high dudgeon.
    Brian did not even miss him.
 How could he at such a time? The weight  of years had been lifted off his soul.
 A consuming happiness took  possession of him; his whole being was a thanksgiving.
 By and by he  went home, found his father in the study, and was about to speak, when  Charles Osmond put an open letter into his hand.
 While Raeburn had  written to his sister, Erica had written to her "prophet" a sad, happy,  quaint letter exactly like herself.
 Its straightforward simplicity  brought the tears to Brian's eyes.
    "It will be a fearful life for her now!" he exclaimed.
 "She will never  be able to endure it.
 Father, now at last I may surely speak to her.
"    He spoke very eagerly.
 Charles Osmond looked grave.
    "My dear old fellow, of course you must do as you think best," he  replied, after a minute's pause; "but I doubt if it is wise just now.
"    "Why, it is the very time of all others when she might be glad of me,"  said Brian.
    "But can't you see," returned his father, "that Erica is the last girl  in the world to marry a man because she was unhappy, or because she had  got a difficult bit of life in front of her? Of course, if you really  think she cares for you, it is different; but--"    "She does not care for me," said Brian quickly; "but in time I think she  would.
 I think I could make her happy.
"    "Yes, I think you could, but I fancy you will make shipwreck of your  hopes if you speak to her now.
 Have patience.
"    "I am sick of patience!" cried Brian desperately.
 "Have I not been  patient for nearly seven years? For what would you have me wait? Am I to  wait till, between our injustice to secularists and their injustice to  Christians, she is half badgered out of life? If she could but love me,  if she would marry me now, I could save her from what must be a life of  misery.
"    "If I could but get you to see it from what I am convinced is Erica's  point of view!" exclaimed Charles Osmond.
 "Forget for a minute that you  are her knight and champion, and try to see things as she sees them.
  Let us try to reverse things.
 Just imagine for a minute that you are the  child of some leading man, the head and chief of a party or association  we'll say that you are the child of an Archbishop of Canterbury.
 You are  carefully educated, you become a zealous worker, you enter into all your  father's interests, you are able to help him in a thousand ways.
 But,  by slow degrees, we will say that you perceive a want in the system in  which you have been educated, and, after many years of careful study  and thought, you are obliged to reject your former beliefs and to accept  that other system which shall most recommend itself to you.
 We will  suppose for the sake of analogy that you become a secularist.
 Knowing  that your change of views will be a terrible grief to your father the  archbishop, it takes your whole strength to make your confession, and  you not only feel your father's personal pain, but you feel that his  pain will be increased by his public position.
 To make it worse, too, we  must suppose that a number of people calling themselves atheists, and  in the name of atheism, have at intervals for the last thirty years been  annoying and insulting your father, that in withstanding their attacks  he has often received bodily injury, and that the atheists have so often  driven him into the law courts that he has been pretty nearly beggared.
  All his privations you have shared for instance, you went with him and  lived for years in a poky little lodging, and denied yourself every  single luxury.
 But now you have, in spite of all these persecutions  carried on in the name of secularism, learned to see that the highest  form of secularism is true.
 The archbishop feels this terribly.
 However,  being a very loving father, he wisely refuses to indulge in perpetual  controversy with his child.
 You agree still to live together, and each  try with all your might to find all the possible points of union still  left you.
 Probably, if you are such a child as I imagine, you love your  father ten times more than you did before.
 Then just as you have made up  your mind to try to be more to him, when all you care about in life is  to comfort and help him, and when your heart is much occupied with your  new opinions, a friend of yours a secularist comes to you, and says: 'A  miserable life lies before you.
 The atheists will never thoroughly  take up with you while you live with your father the archbishop, and  of course it is wretched for you to be surrounded by those of another  creed.
 Come with me.
 I love you I will make you happy, and save you from  persecution.
"    In spite of himself Brian had smiled many times at this putting of an  Archbishop of Canterbury into the position of Luke Raeburn.
 But the  conclusion arrived at seemed to him to admit of only one answer, and  left him very grave.
    "You may be right," he said, very sadly.
 "But to stand still and watch  her suffer--"    He broke off, unable to finish his sentence.
    Charles Osmond took it up.
    "To stand still and watch her suffer will be the terribly hard work of  a brave man who takes a true, deep view.
 To rush in with offers of help  would be the work of an impetuous man who took a very superficial view.
  If Erica were selfish, I would say go and appeal to her selfishness, and  marry her at once; for selfishness will never do any good in Guilford  Terrace.
 But she is one of the most devoted women I know.
 Your appeal  would be rejected.
 I believe she will feel herself in the right place  there, and, as long as that is the case, nothing will move her.
"    "Father," said Brian, rather desperately, "I would take your opinion  before any other opinion in the world.
 You know her well far better than  I do.
 Tell me honestly do you think she could ever love me?"    "You have given me a hard task," said Charles Osmond.
 "But you have  asked for my honest opinion, and you must have it.
 As long as her father  lives I don't believe Erica will ever love a man well enough to marry  him.
 I remember, in my young days, a beautiful girl in our neighborhood,  the belle of the whole county; and years went by, and she had countless  offers, but she rejected them all.
 People used to remonstrate with her,  and ask her how it was.
 'Oh,' she used to reply, 'that is very easily  explained.
.
 I never see a man I think equal to my own brothers!' Now,  whatever faults Raeburn has, we may be sure Erica sees far less plainly  than we see, and nobody can deny that he is a grand fellow.
 When one  bears in mind all that he has had against him, his nobility of character  seems to me marvelous.
 He puts us to shame.
 And that is why he seems to  me the wholesome though powerful medicine for this nineteenth century of  ours, with its great professions and its un-Christlike lives.
"    "What is the use of patience what is the use of love," exclaimed Brian,  "if I am never to serve her?"    "Never! Who said so?" said his father smiling.
 "Why, you have been  serving her every blessed day since you first loved her.
 Is unspoken  love worth nothing? Are prayers useless? Is it of no service to let your  light shine? But I see how it is.
 As a doctor, you look upon pain as the  one great enemy to be fought with, to be bound down, to be conquered.
  You want to shield Erica from pain, which she can't be shielded from, if  she is to go on growing.
         "'Knowledge by suffering entereth!'    No one would so willingly indorse the truth of that as she herself.
  And it will be so to the end of the chapter.
 You can't shut her up in a  beautiful casket, and keep her from all pain.
 If you could she would no  longer be the Erica you love.
 As for the rest, I may be wrong.
 She may  have room for wifely love even now.
 I have only told you what I think.
  And whether she ever be your wife or not and from my heart I hope she  may be your love will in no case be wasted.
 Pure love can't be wasted;  it's an impossibility.
"    Brian sighed heavily, but made no answer.
 Presently he took up his hat  and went out.
 He walked on and on without the faintest idea of time or  place, occupied only with the terrible struggle which was going on  in his heart, which seemed only endurable with the help of rapid and  mechanical exercise.
 When at length he came to himself, he was miles  away from home, right down at Shepherd's Bush, and he heard the church  clocks striking twelve.
 Then he turned back, and walked home more  quietly, his resolution made.
    If he told Erica of his love, and she refused him now, he should not  only add to her troubles, but he should inevitably put an end to the  comfort of the close friendship which now existed between the two  families.
 He would keep silence.
    Erica and her father returned on the Saturday, and then began a most  trying time.
 Tom seemed to shrink from her just as he had done at the  time of her mother's death.
 He was shy and vexed, too, and kept as much  out of her way as possible.
 Mrs. Craigie, on the contrary, could not  leave her alone.
 In spite of her brother's words, she tried every  possible argument and remonstrance in the hope of reconvincing her  niece.
 With the best intentions, she was often grossly unfair, and  Erica, with a naturally quick temper, and her Raeburn inheritance  of fluency and satire, found her patience sorely tried.
 Raeburn was  excessively busy, and they saw very little of him; perhaps he thought it  expedient that Erica should fight her own battles, and fully realize the  seriousness of the steps she had taken.
    "Have you thought," urged Mrs. Craigie, as a last argument "have you  thought what offense you will give to our whole party? What do you think  they will slay when they learn that you of all people have deserted the  cause?"    The tears started to Erica's eyes, for naturally she did feel this a  great deal.
 But she answered bravely, and with a sort of ring in her  voice, which made Tom look up from his newspaper.
    "They will know that Luke Raeburn's daughter must be true to her  convictions at whatever cost.
"    "Will you go on writing in the 'Idol'?" asked Tom, for the first time  making an observation to her which was not altogether necessary.
    "No," said Erica "how can I?"    Tom shrugged his shoulders, and made no further remark.
    "Then how do you mean to live? How else can you support yourself?" asked  Aunt Jean.
    "I don't know," said Erica.
 "I must get some other work somewhere.
"    But her heart failed her, though she spoke firmly.
 She knew that to find  work in London was no easy matter.
    "Offer yourself to the 'Church Chronicle,'" said Mrs. Craigie  sarcastically, "or, better still, to the 'Watch Dog.
' They always make a  good deal of capital out of a convert.
"    Erica colored and had to bite her lip hard to keep back the quick retort  which occurred to her all too naturally.
    By and by Mr. Masterman and another well-known secularist walked in.
  They both knew of Erica's defection.
 Mr. Masterman attacked her at once  in a sort of bantering way.
    "So Miss Raeburn, now I understand why some time ago you walked out in  the middle of my lecture one evening.
"    And then followed a most irritating semi-serious remonstrance, in  questionable taste.
 Erica writhed under it.
 A flippant canvassing of  her most private and sacred thoughts was hard to bear, but she held  her ground, and, being not without a touch of her father's dignity, Mr.  Masterman presently beat a retreat, not feeling quite so well satisfied  with himself as usual.
 His companion did not allude directly to her  change of views, but treated her with a sort of pitying condescension,  as if she had been a mild lunatic.
    There was some sort of committee being held in the study that evening.
  The next person to arrive was Professor Gosse and almost immediately  after came Mr. Harmston, a charming old man, whom Erica had known from  her childhood.
 They came in and had some coffee before going into the  study.
 Mrs. Craigie talked to Mr. Harmston.
 Erica, looking her loveliest  waited on them.
 Tom watched them all philosophically from the hearth  rug.
    "I am sorry to hear you have deserted your colors," said the professor,  looking more grave than she had ever seen him look before.
 Then, his  voice softening a little as he looked at her, "I expect it all comes of  that illness of yours.
 I believe religion is just an outgrowth of bad  health mens sana in corpore sano, you know.
 Never mind, you must still  come to my workshop, and I shall see if science won't reconvert you.
"    He moved away with his good-humored, shaggy-looking face, leaving Erica  to old Mr. Harmston.
    "I am much grieved to hear this of you, Erica," he said, lowering his  voice, and bringing his gray head near to hers "as grieved as if you  were my own child.
 You will be a sore loss to us all.
"    Erica felt this keenly, for she was very fond of the old man.
    "Do you think it does not hurt me to grieve you all?" she said,  piteously.
 "But one must be honest.
"    "Quite right, my dear," said the old man, "but that does not make our  loss the less heavy.
 We had hoped great things of you, Erica.
 It  is grievous to me that you should have fallen back to the miserable  superstitions against which your father has fought so bravely.
"    "Come, Mr. Harmston," said the professor; "we are late, I fancy.
"    And before Erica could make any reply Mrs. Craigie and the two visitors  had adjourned to the committee room, leaving her alone with Tom.
    Now, for two or three days Erica had been enduring Tom's coldness and  Mrs. Craigie's unceasing remonstrances; all the afternoon she had been  having a long and painful discussion with her friend, Mrs. MacNaughton;  this evening she had seen plainly enough what her position would be  for the future among all her old acquaintances, and an aching sense of  isolation filled her heart.
 She was just going to run upstairs and yield  to her longing for darkness and quiet, when Tom called her back.
 She  could not refuse to hear, for the coldness of her old playmate had made  her very sad, but she turned back rather reluctantly, for her eyes were  brimming with tears.
    "Don't go," said Tom, quite in his natural voice.
 "Have you any coffee  for me, or did the old fogies finish it?"    Erica went back to the table and poured him out a cup of coffee, but her  hand trembled, and, before she could prevent it, down splashed a great  tear into the saucer.
    "Come!" said Tom, cheerfully.
 "Don't go and spoil my coffee with salt  water! All very well for David, in a penitential psalm, to drink tears,  but in the nineteenth century, you know--"    Erica began to laugh at this, a fatal proceeding, for afterward came a  great sob, and the tears came down in good earnest.
 Philosophical Tom  always professed great contempt for tears, and he knew that Erica must  be very much moved indeed to cry in his presence, or, indeed, to cry  at all; for, as he expressed it: "It was not in her line.
" But somehow,  when for the first time he saw her cry, he did not feel contemptuous;  instead, he began to call himself a "hard-hearted brute," and a  narrow-minded fool, and to feel miserable and out of conceit with  himself.
    "I say, Erica, don't cry," he pleaded.
 "Don't, I say, I can't bear to  see you.
 I've been a cold-blooded wretch I'm awfully sorry!"    "It's very cowardly of me," sobbed Erica.
 "But--but--" with a rush of  tears, "you don't know how I love you all it's like being killed by  inches.
"    "You're not cowardly," said Tom, warmly.
 "You've been brave and plucky;  I only wish it were in a better cause.
 Look here, Erica, only stop  crying, and promise me that you'll not take this so dreadfully to heart.
  I'll stand by you I will, indeed, even though I hate your cause.
 But  it sha'n't come between us any longer, the hateful delusion has spoiled  enough lives already.
 It sha'n't spoil ours.
"    "Oh, don't!" cried Erica, wounded anew by this.
    "Well," said Tom, gulping down his longing to inveigh against  Christianity, "it goes hard with me not to say a word against the  religion that has brought us all our misery, but for your sake I'll try  not when talking with you.
 Now let us begin again on the old footing.
"    "Not quite on the old footing either," said Erica, who had conquered her  tears.
 "I love you a thousand times more, you dear old Tom.
"    And Tom, who was made of sterling stuff, did from that day forward stand  by her through everything, and checked himself when harsh words about  religious matters rose to his lips, and tried his best to smooth what  could not fail to be a rough bit of walking.
    The first meeting between Charles Osmond and Erica, after her return  from Codrington, did not come about till the morning after her  conversation with Tom.
 They had each called on the other, but had  somehow managed to miss.
 When at length Erica was shown into the study,  connected in her mind with so many warm discussions, she found it empty.
  She sat down in the great arm chair by the window, wondering if she were  indeed the same Erica who had sat there years before, on the day when  her "prophet" had foretold her illness.
 What changes had come about  since then!    But her "Prophet" was unchanged, his brisk, "Well Erica!" was exactly  what it had been when she had come to him in the days of her atheism.
  It had always been full of welcome and sympathy, and now the only  difference was that a great happiness shone in his eyes as he came  forward with his soft, steady tread and took her hand in both his.
    They sat silent for awhile, then talked a little but reservedly, for  both felt that the subject which filled their thoughts was at once too  sacred and too personal to be altogether put into words.
 Then by and  by they began to discuss the practical consequences of the change,  and especially the great difficulty as to Erica's means of supporting  herself.
    "Could you not try teaching?" said Charles Osmond.
    "The market is already overstocked.
"    "True, but I should think that your brains and certificates ought to  secure you work in spite of that.
"    "I should like it in many ways," said Erica, "but, you see, except at  the night school it is out of the question, and I could not live upon  my grant even if every one of my class passed the examination.
 For any  other sort of teaching who do you imagine would have the courage to  employ any one bearing the name of Raeburn? Why, I can't give an order  in a shop without being looked all over by the person who takes the  address.
 No, governessing would be all very well if one might assume a  nom de guerre, but that would not do, you see.
"    "You couldn't find work of that sort among your own set, I suppose?"    "Not now," said Erica.
 "You see, naturally enough, I am very much out of  favor with them all.
"    "Falling between two stools," said Charles Osmond, half to himself.
 "But  don't lose heart, Erica: 'A stone that is fit for the wall will not be  left in the way;' there is work for you somewhere.
 By the way, I might  see old Crutchley he knows all the literary folk, and might get you an  introduction to some one, at any rate.
"    Just as Erica was leaving Brian came in from his rounds, and they met at  the door.
 Had he known her trouble and perplexity as to work, no power  on earth could have induced him to keep silence any longer; but he knew  nothing.
 She looked a little pale, but that was natural enough, and in  her eyes he could see a peace which he had never seen there before.
 Then  deep unselfish happiness filled his heart again, and Erica recognized  in his greeting a great deal more than an ordinary by-stander would have  seen.
 She went away feeling bettered by that handclasp.
    "That is a downright good man!" she thought to herself.
 "Perhaps by the  time he's fifty-five, he'll be almost equal to his father.
"        .
 An Editor         Socrates   How singular is the thing called pleasure, and       how curiously related to pain, which might be thought to be       the opposite; for they never come to a man together, and yet       he who pursues either of them is generally compelled to take       the other.
 They are two, and yet they grow together out of       one head or stem; and I can not help thinking that, if Aesop       had noticed them, he would have made a fable about God       trying to reconcile their strife, and when he could not, he       fastened their heads together; and this is the reason why       when one comes the other follows.
  Plato    That Erica should live any longer upon the money which her father  chiefly made by the dissemination of views with which she disagreed  was clearly impossible, at least impossible to one of her sincere and  thorough nature.
 But to find work was very difficult, indeed.
 After an  anxious waiting and searching, she was one day surprised by receiving  through Charles Osmond's friend, Mr. Crutchley, an introduction to the  editor of a well-known and widely read paper.
 Every one congratulated  her, but she could not feel very hopeful, it seemed too good to prove  true it was, in fact, so exactly the position which she would herself  have chosen that it seemed unlikely it should ever really be hers.
 Still  of course she hoped, and arrangements were made for an interview with  Mr. Bircham, editor and part proprietor of the "Daily Review.
"    Accordingly, one hot summer morning Erica dressed herself carefully,  tried to look old and serious, and set off with Tom to the city.
    "I'll see you safe to the door of the lion's den," said Tom as they made  their way along the crowded streets.
 "I only wish I could be under the  table during the interview; I should like to see you doing the dignified  journalist.
"    "I wouldn't have you for the world!" said Erica, laughing.
 Then, growing  grave again, "Oh, Tom! How I wish it were over! It's worse than three  hundred visits to a dentist rolled into one.
"    "Appalling prospect!" said Tom.
 "I can exactly picture what it will  be.
 BIRCHAM! Such a forbidding name for an editor.
 He'll be a sort of  editorial Mr. Squeers; he'll talk in a loud, blustering way, and you'll  feel exactly like a journalistic Smike.
"    "No," said Erica, laughing.
 "He'll be a neat little dapper man, very  smooth and bland, and he'll talk patronizingly and raise my hopes, and  then, in a few days' time will send me a polite refusal.
"    "Tell him at once that you hero-worship Sir Michael Cunningham, the  statesman of the age, the most renowned 'Sly Bacon!'"    "Tom, do be quiet!" said Erica.
 "I wish you had never thought of that  horrid name.
"    "Horrid! I mean to make my fortune out of it.
 If you like, you can offer  the pun on reasonable terms to Mr. Bircham.
"    "Why, this is Fleet Street! Doesn't it lead out of this?" said Erica,  with an indescribable feeling in the back of her neck.
 "We must be quite  near.
"    "Nearer than near," said Tom.
 "Now then, left wheel! Here we are, you  see.
 It's a mercy that you turn pink with fright, not green like the  sea-green Robespierre.
 Go in looking as pretty as that, and Mr. Squeers  will graciously accept your services, unless he's sand-blind.
"    "What a tease you are.
 Do be quiet!" implored Erica.
 And then, in what  seemed to her an alarmingly short time she was actually left by herself  to beard the lion, and a clerk was assuring her that Mr. Bircham was in,  and would she walk upstairs.
    For reasons best known to himself, the editor of the "Daily Review" had  his private room at the very top of the house.
 A sedate clerk led the  way up a dingy staircase, and Erica toiled after him, wondering how much  breath she should have left by the time she reached the end.
 On one of  the landings she caught sight of a sandy cat and felt a little reassured  at meeting such an every-day creature in this grim abode; she gave it a  furtive stroke as she passed, and would have felt it a protection if  she could have picked it up and taken it with her.
 That would have been  undignified, however, and by the time she reached the editor's room  only a very observant person could have discovered in her frank,  self-possessed manner any trace of nervousness.
    So different was Mr Bircham from their preconceived notions that she  could almost have laughed at the contrast.
 He was very tall and pompous,  he wore a lank brown wig which looked as if it might come off at any  moment, he had little keen gray eyes which twinkled, and a broad mouth  which shut very closely; whether it was grim or humorous she could not  quite decide.
 He was sitting in a swivel chair, and the table strewn  with letters, and the desk with its pigeon holes crammed with papers,  looked so natural and so like her father's that she began to feel a  reassuring sense of fellowship with this entire stranger.
 The inevitable  paste-pot and scissors, the piles of newspapers, the books of reference,  all looked homelike to her.
    Mr. Bircham rose and bowed rather formally, motioned her to a seat, and  swung round his own seat so that they faced one another.
 Then he scanned  her from head to foot with the sort of appraising glance to which she  was only too well accustomed a glance which said as plainly as words:  "Oh! So you are that atheist's daughter are you?"    But whatever impression Erica made upon Mr. Bircham, not a muscle of  his face altered, and he began to discuss business in a most formal and  business-like way.
 Things did not seem very hopeful, and Erica began to  doubt more and ore whether she had the smallest chance of acceptance.
  Something in the dry formal manner of the editor struck a chill to her  heart.
 So much, so very much depended on this interview, and already the  prospect seemed far from hopeful.
    "I should like to see some of your work," observed Mr. Bircham.
 "How  long have you been in the habit of writing in Mr. Raeburn's organ?"    "For the last five years," said Erica.
    Mr. Bircham lifted his shaggy eyebrows at this, for Erica looked even  younger than she really was.
 However, he made no comment, but took up  the end of a speaking tube.
    "Send up Jones with the file of 'Idol-Breakers' I ordered.
"    Erica's color rose.
 Presently the answer from the lower regions appeared  in the shape of the sedate clerk carrying a great bundle of last year's  'Idol-Breakers.
'    "Perhaps you will show me one or two of your average articles," said Mr.  Bircham, and, while Erica searched through the bundle of papers, he took  up one of the copies which she had put aside, and studied the outside  page critically.
 "'The Idol-Breaker:' Advocate of Freethought and  Secularism.
 Edited by Luke Raeburn.
"    "They are slaves who dare not be In the right with two or three.
"    Mr. Bircham put it down and began to watch her attentively.
 She was  absorbed in her search, and was quite unconscious of his scrutiny.
 Even  had she noticed him, she would not have understood what was passing in  his mind.
 His little gray eyes grew bright; then he pushed back his wig  impatiently; then he cleared his throat; finally he took snuff, sneezed  violently, and walked to the window.
 When he returned he was even more  dry and formal than before.
    "These, I think, are fairly representative," said Erica.
 "I have marked  them on the margin.
"    He took the three or four copies she handed to him, and began to look  through one of the articles, muttering a sentence half aloud every now  and then, and making little ejaculations which might have been either  approval or disapproval.
    Finally the interview ended.
 Mr. Bircham put down the papers with a sigh  of utter weariness, Erica thought.
    "Well, Miss Raeburn," he remarked, "I will look at one or two of your  other articles, and will communicate with you in a few days' time.
"    Then he shook hands with her with frigid politeness, and in another  minute she was slowly making her way down the dingy staircase.
 Partly  from the reaction after her excitement, partly from mental worry and  physical weariness, she felt by the time she was fairly out of the  office as if she could hardly drag herself along.
 Her heart was like  lead, blank loss of hope and weary anxiety as to the next effort to be  made were weighing her down.
 She was naturally high-spirited, but when  high-spirited people do get depressed, they go down to the very deepest  depths; and her interview with Mr. Bircham, by its dry cheerlessness, by  its lack of human interest, had chilled her all through.
 If he had  even made a remark on the weather, she thought she could have liked him  better; if he had expressed an opinion on any subject, even if she had  disagreed with him, it would have been a relief; as it was, he seemed to  her more like a hard steel pen dressed in broadcloth than a man.
    As to his last remark, that could only mean one thing.
 He did not like  to tell her to her face that she would not suit him, but, he would  communicate with her in a few days, and say it comfortably on paper.
    She had never felt quite so desolate and forlorn and helpless as she  felt that day when she left the "Daily Review" office, and found herself  in the noise and bustle of Fleet Street.
 The midday sun blazed down upon  her in all its strength; the pavements seemed to scorch her feet; the  weary succession of hurrying, pushing, jostling passengers seemed to add  to her sense of isolation.
 Presently a girl stopped her, and asked the  way to Basinghall Street.
 She knew it well enough, but felt too utterly  stupid to direct her.
    "You had better ask a policeman," she replied, wearily.
    Then, recollecting that she had several commissions to do for her  father, besides a great deal to do at the stores, she braced herself  up, and tried to forget Mr. Bircham, and to devote her whole mind to the  petty details of shopping.
    The next evening she was in the study with her father when Tom  brought in a bundle of letters.
 One of them was for Erica.
 She at once  recognized Mr. Bircham's writing, and a new pang of disappointment shot  through her, though she had really lost all hope on the previous day.
  This very speedy communication could only mean that his mind had been  practically made up before.
 She began to think of her next chance, of  the next quarter she must try, and slowly opened the unwelcome letter.
  But in a moment she had sprung to her feet in an ecstasy of happiness.
    "Oh, father! Oh, Tom! He will have me!"    Raeburn looked up from his correspondence, and together they read Mr.  Bircham's letter.
 It was quite as business-like as he himself had been  at the interview.
    "Dear Madame, Having fully considered the matter, we are prepared to  offer you a place on our staff.
 The work required was explained to you  yesterday.
 For this we offer a salary of 200 pounds per annum.
 Should  you signify your acceptance of these terms, we will send you our usual  form of agreement.
 I am yours faithfully, Jacob Bircham.
    "To Miss Raeburn.
"    "Commend me to people who don't raise one's expectations!" said Erica,  rapturously.
 "Three cheers for my dear, stiff old editor!"    So that anxiety was over, and Erica was most thankful to have such a  load taken off her mind.
 The comfort of it helped her through a very  trying summer.
        .
 Erica to the Rescue         Isabel: I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul       in the truth of my spirit.
         Duke: Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful.
       Measure for Measure    It was the first of September.
 Watering places were crowded with  visitors, destruction had begun among the partridges, and a certain  portion of the hard-working community were taking their annual holiday.
    Raeburn, whose holidays were few and far between, had been toiling away  all through the summer months in town.
 This evening, as he sat in his  stifling little study, he had fallen into a blank fit of depression.
 He  could neither work nor read.
 Strong as his nature was, it was not  always proof against this grim demon, which avenged itself on him for  overtasking his brain, shortening his hours of sleep, and in other ways  sacrificing himself to his work.
 Tonight, however, there was reason for  his depression; for while he sat fighting his demon at home, Erica had  gone to Charles Osmond's church it was the evening of her baptism.
    Of course it was the necessary sequence of the confession she had made  a few months before, and Raeburn had long known that it was inevitable;  but none the less did he this evening suffer more acutely than he had  yet suffered, realizing more fully his child's defection The private  confession had startled, shocked, grieved him inexpressibly; but the  public profession, with its sense of irrevocableness, filled his heart  with a grief for which he could find no single ray of comfort.
    Erica's brave endurance of all the trials and discomforts involved in  her change of faith had impressed him not a little, and even when most  hurt and annoyed by her new views, he had always tried to shield her;  but it had been a hard summer, and the loss of the home unity had tried  him sorely.
    Moreover, the comparative quiet of the last year was now ended.
 A new  foe had arisen in the person of a certain retired cheesemonger, who had  sworn war to the knife against the apostle of atheism.
 Unfortunately,  Mr. Pogson's war was not undertaken in a Christ-like spirit; his zeal  was fast changing into personal animosity, and he had avowed the he  would crush Raeburn, though it should cost him the whole of his fortune.
  This very day he had brought into action the mischievous and unfair  blasphemy laws, and to everybody's amazement, had commenced a  prosecution against Raeburn for a so-called "blasphemous libel" in one  of his recent pamphlets.
 An attack on the liberty of the press was to  Raeburn what the sound of the trumpet is to the war horse.
 Yet, now that  the first excitement was over, he had somehow sunk into a fit of black  depression.
 How was it? Was his strength failing? Was he growing old  unfit for his work?    He was roused at length by a knock at his door.
 The servant entered  with a number of letters.
 He turned them over mechanically until some  handwriting which reminded him of his mother's made him pause.
 The  letter bore the Greyshot postmark; it must be from his sister Isabel.
 He  opened it with some eagerness; there had been no communication between  them since the time of his wife's death, and though he had hoped that  the correspondence once begun might have been continued, nothing more  had come of it.
 The letter proved short, and not altogether palatable.
  It began with rejoicings over Erica's change of views, the report of  which had reached Mrs. Fane-Smith.
 It went on to regret that he did  not share in the change.
 Raeburn's lip curled as he read.
 Then came  a request that Erica might be allowed to visit her relations, and the  letter ended with a kindly-meant but mistaken offer.
    "My husband and I both feel that there are many objections to Erica's  remaining in her present home.
 We should be much pleased if she would  live with us at any rate, until she has met with some situation which  would provide her with a suitable and permanent residence.
"    The offer was not intended to be insulting, but undoubtedly, to such  a father as Raeburn, it was a gross insult.
 His eyes flashed fire, and  involuntarily he crushed the letter in his hand; then, a little ashamed  of the passionate act, he forced himself deliberately to smooth it out  again, and, folding it accurately, put it in his pocket.
 A note for  Erica remained in the envelope; he placed it on the mantel piece, then  fell back in his chair again and thought.
    After all, might not the visit to Greyshot be a very good thing for her?  Of course she would never dream of living with her aunt, would indeed be  as angry at the proposal as he had been.
 But might not a visit of two  or three weeks open her eyes to her new position, and prove to her that  among Christians such people as the Osmonds were only in the minority!  He knew enough of society to be able to estimate the position it would  accord to Erica.
 He knew that her sensitiveness would be wounded again  and again, that, that her honesty would be shocked, her belief in the  so-called Christian world shaken.
 Might not all this be salutary? And  yet he did not like the thought; he could not bear sending her out alone  to fight her own battles, could not endure the consciousness that she  was bearing his reproach.
 Oh, why had this miserable, desolating change  ever occurred? At this very moment she was making public profession of  a faith which could only place her in the most trying of positions;  at this very moment she was pledging herself to a life of bondage  and trouble; while he, standing aside, could see all the dangers and  difficulties of her future, and could do absolutely nothing!    It reminded him of one of the most horrible moments of his life.
 Walking  up Regent Street one afternoon, years ago, Erica, walking with Mrs.  Craigie on the opposite side, had caught sight of him, and regardless  of the fourfold chain of carriages, had rushed across to him with the  fearless daring of a six-year-old child, to whom the danger of horses'  hoofs was a mere nothing when compared with the desire to get a walk  with her father.
 His heart beat quicker even now as he thought of the  paralyzing dread of long ago, nor had Miss Erica ever been scolded for  her loving rashness; in his relief he had been unable to do anything  but clasp the little hand in his as though nothing should ever part them  again.
    But her loving disregard of all danger and difficulty was no longer  inspired by love of him, but by love of what Raeburn considered a myth  and a delusion.
    In that lay the real sting.
 He courage, her suffering, all seemed to him  wasted, altogether on the wrong side.
 Once more black gloom fell upon  him.
 The room grew dusk then dark, but still he remained motionless.
    Again he was interrupted by a knock at his door.
    "Signor Civita wished to speak to him.
"    He braced himself up for an interview with some stranger, and in walked  a foreigner wrapped in a long cloak, and looking exceedingly like a  stage brigand.
    He bowed, the brigand bowed too, and said something rapid and  unintelligible in Italian.
 Then glanced at the door to see that it  was safely closed, he made a bound to the open window and shut it  noiselessly.
 Raeburn quietly reached down a loaded revolver which hung  about the mantel piece, and cocked it, whereupon the brigand fell into a  paroxysm of laughter, and exclaimed in German:    "Why, my good friend! Do you not know me?"    "Haeberlein!" exclaimed Raeburn, in utter amazement, submitting to a  German embrace.
    "Eric himself and no other!" returned the brigand.
 "Draw your curtains  and lock your door and you shall see me in the flesh.
 I am half stifled  in this lordly wig.
"    "Wait," said Raeburn.
 "Be cautious.
"    He left him for a minute, and Haeberlein heard him giving orders that  no one else was to be admitted that evening.
 Then he came back, quietly  bolted the door, closed the shutters, and lighted the gas.
 In the  meantime his friend threw off his cloak, removed the wig of long, dark  hair, and the drooping mustache and shaggy eyebrows, revealing his  natural face and form.
 Raeburn grasped his hand once more.
    "Now I feel that I've got you, Eric!" he exclaimed.
 "What lucky chance  has brought you so unexpectedly?"    "No lucky one!" said Haeberlein, with an expressive motion of the  shoulders.
 "But of that anon; let me look at you, old fellow why you're  as white as a miller! Call yourself six-and-forty! You might pass for my  grandfather!"    Raeburn, who had a large reserve fund of humor, caught up his friend's  black wig from the table and put it on above his own thick, white hair,  showing plainly enough that in face and spirits he was as young as  ever.
 It was seven years since they had met, and they fell to talk of  reminiscences, and in the happiness of their meeting put off the more  serious matters which must be discussed before long.
 It was a good half  hour before Haeberlein alluded to the occasion of his present visit.
    "Bring actually in London, I couldn't resist looking in upon you," he  said, a cloud of care coming over his face.
 "I only hope it won't get  you into a scrape.
 I came over to try to avert this deplorable business  about poor Kellner too late, I fear.
 And the worst of it is, I must have  blundered somehow for my coming leaked out, and they are on the watch  for me.
 If I get safe across to France tonight, I shall be lucky.
"    "Incautious as ever," sighed Raeburn.
 "And that Kellner richly deserves  his fate.
 Why should you meddle?"    "I was bound to," said Haeberlein.
 "He did me many a good turn during my  exile, and though he has made a grave mistake, yet--"    "Yet you must run your chivalrous head into a halter for his sake!"  exclaimed Raeburn.
 "You were ever Quixote.
 I shall live to see you  hanged yet.
"    Haeberlein laughed.
    "No, I don't think you will," he said, cheerfully.
 "I've had some bad  falls, but I've always fallen on my feet.
 With a good cause, a man has  little to fear.
"    "If this WERE a good cause," said Raeburn, with significant emphasis.
    "It was the least I could do," said Haeberlein, with the chivalrous  disregard of self which was his chief characteristic.
 "I only fear that  my coming here may involve you in it which Heaven forfend! I should  never forgive myself if I injured your reputation.
"    Raeburn smiled rather bitterly.
    "You need not fear that.
 My reputation has long been at the mercy of  all the lying braggarts in the country.
 Men label me socialist one  day, individualist the next.
 I become communist or egotist, as is most  convenient to the speaker and most damaging to myself.
 But there," he  exclaimed, regaining the tranquil serenity which characterized him, "why  should I rail at the world when I might be talking to you? How is my old  friend Hans?"    The sound of a key in the latch startled them.
    "It is only Erica," said Raeburn.
 "I had forgotten she was out.
"    "My pretty little namesake! I should like to see her.
 Is she still a  zealous little atheist?"    "No, she has become a Christian," said Raeburn, speaking with some  effort.
    "So!" exclaimed Haeberlein, without further comment.
 He himself was of  no particular creed; he was just indifferent, and the zeal of his friend  often surprised him.
    Raeburn went out into the passage, drew Erica into the front sitting  room, and closed the door.
    "There is an old friend of yours in my study," he said.
 "He wishes to  see you, but you must promise secrecy, for he is in danger.
"    "Is it Herr Haeberlein?" asked Erica.
    "Yes, on one of his rash, kindly errands, but one of which I don't  approve.
 However, his work is over, and we must try to get him safely  off to France.
 Come in with me if you will, but I wanted to tell you  about it first, so that you should not be mixed up with this against  your will, which would be unfair!"    "Would it?" said Erica, smiling, as she slipped her hand into his.
    Haeberlein had taken a newspaper out of his pocket, and was searching  for something.
 The gas light fell on his clean-shaven face, revealing  a sweet-tempered mouth, keen blue eyes, a broad German forehead, and  closely cropped iron-gray hair.
 Erica thought him scarcely altered since  their last meeting.
 He threw down his newspaper as she approached.
    "Well, my Herzblattchen!" he exclaimed, saluting her with a double kiss,  "so you are not ashamed of your old friend? So," holding her at arms'  length and regarding her critically, "Potztausend! The English girls do  beat ours all to nothing.
 Well, my Liebchen, dost thou remember the day  when thou carried the Casati dispatches in thy geography book under the  very nose of a spy? It was a brave deed that, and it saved a brave man's  life.
"    Erica smiled and colored.
 "I was not so brave as I seemed," she said.
  "My heart was beating so loud, I thought people must hear it.
"    "Has thou never heard the saying of the first Napoleon, 'The bravest man  is he who can conceal his fear?' I do not come under that category, for  I never had fear never felt it.
 Thou wouldst not dream, Herzblattchen,  that spies are at this moment dogging my steps while I jest here with  thee?"    "Is that indeed true?" exclaimed Erica.
    They explained to her a little more of Haeberlein's errand and the risk  he ran; he alluded to his hopes that Raeburn might not be involved in  any unpleasant consequences.
 Erica grew pale at the bare suggestion.
    "See," exclaimed Haeberlein, "the little one cares more for your  reputation than you do yourself, my friend.
 See what it is to have a  daughter who can be afraid for you, though she can not be afraid for  herself! But, Liebchen, Thou must not blame me for coming to see him.
  Think! My best friend, and unseen for seven years!"    "It is worth a good deal of risk," said Erica, brightly.
 But as the  terror or having her father's name mentioned in connection with Herr  Kellner's once more returned to her, she added, pleadingly, "And you  WILL be careful when you leave the house?"    "Yes, indeed," said Haeberlein.
 "See what a disguise I have.
"    He hastily donned the black wig, mustache and eyebrows, and the long  Italian cloak.
    Erica looked at him critically.
    "Art thou not satisfied?" he asked.
    "Not a bit," she said, promptly.
 "In London every one would turn to look  twice at such a dress as that, which is what you want to avoid.
 Besides,  those eyebrows are so outrageous, so evidently false.
"    She thought for a minute.
    "My brown Inverness," suggested Raeburn.
    "Too thick for a summer night," said Erica, "and" glancing from her  father to Haeberlein "too long to look natural.
 I think Tom's ulster and  traveling hat would be better.
"    "Commend me to a woman when you want sound advice!" cried Haeberlein.
    Erica went to search Tom's room for the ulster, and in the meantime  Haeberlein showed his friend a paragraph in one of the evening papers  which proved to Raeburn that the risk was indeed very great.
 They were  discussing things much more gravely when Erica returned.
    "The stations will be watched," Haeberlein was saying.
    "What station do you go to?" asked Erica.
    "I thought of trying Cannon Street," replied the German.
    "Because," continued Erica, "I think you had better let me see you off.
  You will look like a young Englishman, and I shall do all the talking,  so that you need not betray your accent.
 They would never dream of Herr  Haeberlein laughing and talking with a young girl.
"    "They would never dream that a young girl would be brave enough to run  such a risk!" said Haeberlein.
 "No, my sweet Herzblattchen, I could not  bring thee into danger.
"    "There will be none for me," said Erica, "and it may save you from evil  and my father from suspicion.
 Father, if you will let me, it would be  more of a disguise than anything.
"    "You might meet some one you know," said Raeburn.
    "Very unlikely," she replied.
 "And even if I did, what would it matter?  I need not tell them anything, and Herr Haeberlein would get off all the  same.
"    He saw that she was too pure and too unconventional to understand his  objection, but his whole heart rebelled against the idea of letting her  undertake the task, and it was only after much persuasion that she drew  from him a reluctant consent.
 After all, it would be a great safeguard  to Haeberlein, and Haeberlein was his dearest friend.
 For no one else  could he have risked what was so precious to him.
 There was very little  time for discussion.
 The instant his permission was given, Erica ran  upstairs to Tom's private den, lighted his gas stove, and made a cup of  chocolate, at the same time blackening a cork very carefully.
 In a few  minutes she returned to the study, carrying the chocolate and a plate  of rusks, which she remembered were a particular weakness of Herr  Haeberlein's.
 She found that in her absence the two had been discussing  matters again, for Haeberlein met her with another remonstrance.
    "Liebe Erica," he began, "I yielded just now to thy generous proposal;  but I think it will not do.
 For myself I can be rash, but not for thee.
  Thou art too frail and lovely, my little one, to get mixed up with the  grim realities of such a life as mine.
"    She only laughed.
 "Why, I have been mixed up with them ever since I was  a baby!"    "True; but now it is different.
 The world might judge thee harshly,  people might say things which would wound thee.
"    "They say! 'LET them say!'" quoted Erica, smiling, "mens conscia recti  will carry one through worse things than a little slander.
 No, no, you  must really let me have my own way.
 It is right, and there's an end of  it!"    Raeburn let things run their course; he agreed with Erica all the  time, though his heart impelled him to keep her at home.
 And as to Eric  Haeberlein, it would have needed a far stronger mind than that of the  sweet-tempered, quixotic German to resist the generous help offered by  such a lovely girl.
    There was no time to lose; the latest train for the Continent left at  9:25, and before Haeberlein had adjusted his new disguise the clock  struck nine.
 Erica very carefully blackened his eyebrows and ruthlessly  sheared the long black wig to an ordinary and unnoticeable length, and,  when Tom's ulster and hat were added, the disguise was so perfect, and  made Haeberlein look so absurdly young, that Raeburn himself could not  possibly have recognized him.
    In past years Raeburn had often risked a great deal for his friend.
 At  one time his house had been watched day and night in consequence of his  well-known friendship with the Republican Don Quixote.
 Unfortunately,  therefore, it was only too probable that Haeberlein in risking his visit  this evening might have run into a trap.
 If he were being searched for,  his friend's house would almost inevitably be watched.
    They exchanged farewells, not without some show of emotion on each  side, and just at the last Raeburn hastily bent down and kissed Erica's  forehead, at his heart a sickening sense of anxiety.
 She too was  anxious, but she was very happy to have found on the evening of her  baptism so unusual a service to render to her father, and, besides, the  consciousness of danger always raised her spirits.
    When, as they had half expected, they found the would-be natural-looking  detective prowling up and down the cul-de-sac, it was no effort to  her to begin at once a laughing account of a school examination which  Charles Osmond had told her about, and so naturally and brightly did she  talk that, though actually brushing past the spy under the full light of  the street lamp.
, she entirely disarmed suspicion.
    It was a horrible moment, however.
 Her heart beat wildly as they passed  on, and every moment she thought she should hear quick steps behind  them.
 But nothing came of it, and in a few minutes they were walking  down Southampton Row.
 When this was safely passed, she began to feel  comparatively at ease.
 Haeberlein thought they might take a cab.
    "Not a hansom," she said, quickly, as he was on the point of hailing  one.
 "You would be so much more exposed, you know!"    Haeberlein extolled her common sense, and they secured a four-wheeler  and drove to Cannon Street.
    Talking now became more possible.
 Haeberlein leaned far back in the  corner, and spoke in low tones.
    "Thou has been my salvation, Erica," he said, pressing her hand.
 "That  fellow would never have let me pass in the Italian costume.
 Thou wert  right as usual, it was theatrical how do you call stagey, is it not?    "I am a little troubled about your mouth," said Erica, smiling, "the  mustache doesn't disguise it, and it looks so good-tempered and like  itself.
 Can't you feel severe just for half an hour?"    Haeberlein smiled his irresistibly sweet smile, and tried to comply with  her wishes, but not very successfully.
    "I think," said Erica, presently, "it will be the best way, if you don't  mind, for you just to stroll through the booking office while I take  your ticket.
 I can meet you by the book stall and I will still talk for  us both in case you betray your accent.
"    "HERZBLATTCHEN!" exclaimed Haeberlein, "how shall I ever repay thee!  Thou art a real canny little Scot! I only wish I had half thy caution  and forethought!"    "Don't look like that!" said Erica, laughing, as the benignant  expression once more came over his lips.
 "You really must try to turn  down the corners! Your character is a silent, morose misanthrope.
 I am  the chatter box, pure and simple.
"    They were both laughing when they drew near to the station, but a sense  of the risk sobered Haeberlein, and Erica carried out her programme to  perfection.
 It was rather a shock to her, indeed, to find a detective  keenly inspecting all who went to the ticket office.
 He stood so  close to the pigeon hole that Erica doubted whether Herr Haeberlein's  eyebrows, improved though they were, could possibly have escaped  detection.
 It required all her self command to prevent her color from  rising and her fingers from trembling as she received the ticket  and change under that steady scrutiny.
 Then she passed out on to the  platform and found that Herr Haeberlein had been wise enough to buy the  paper which least sympathized with his views, and in a few minutes he  was safely disposed in the middle of a well-filled carriage.
    Erica took out her watch.
 There were still three minutes before the  train started, three long, interminable minutes! She looked down the  platform, and her heart died within her; for, steadily advancing toward  them, she saw two men making careful search in every carriage.
    Herr Haeberlein was sitting with his back to the engine.
 Between him  and the door sat a lady with a copy of the "Graphic" on her knee.
 If  she could only have been persuaded to read it, it might have made an  effectual screen.
 She tried to will her to take it up, but without  success.
 And still the detectives moved steadily forward with their keen  scrutiny.
    Erica was in despair.
 Herr Haeberlein imagined himself safe now, and  she could not warn him without attracting the notice and rousing the  suspicion of the passengers.
 To complete her misery, she saw that he  had pushed his wig a little on one side, and through the black hair she  caught a glimpse of silver gray.
    Her heart beat so fast that it almost choked her, but still she forced  herself to talk and laugh, though every moment the danger drew nearer.
  At the very last moment an inspiration came to her.
 The detectives were  examining the next carriage.
    "They are taking things in the most leisurely way tonight!" she  exclaimed.
 "I'm tired of waiting.
 I shall say goodbye to you, and go  home, I think.
"    As she spoke, she opened the carriage door stepped in, and  demonstratively kissed her silent companion, much to the amusement  of the passengers, who had been a good deal diverted by her racy  conversation and the grumpy replies of the traveler.
 There was a smile  on every face when one of the detectives looked in.
 He glanced to the  other side of the carriage and saw a dark-haired young man in an ulster,  and a pretty girl taking leave of her lover.
 Erica's face entirely hid  Herr Haeberlien's from view and the man passed on with a shrug and a  smile.
 She had contrived to readjust his wig, and with many last words,  managed to spin out the remaining time, till at last the welcome signal  of departure was given.
    Haeberlein's mouth relaxed into a benignant smile, as he nodded a  farewell; then he discreetly composed himself into a sleeping posture,  while Erica stood on the platform and waved her handkerchief.
    As she moved away the two detectives passed by her.
    "Not there! At any rate," she heard one of them say.
 "Maybe they got him  by the nine o'clock at Waterloo.
"    "More likely trapped him in Guilford Terrace," replied the other.
    Erica, shaking with suppressed laughter, saw the men leave the station;  and then, springing into a cab, drove to a street in the neighborhood of  Guildford Square.
    Now that her work was over, she began to feel what a terrible strain it  had been.
 At first she lay back in the corner of the cab in a state of  dreamy peace, watching the gas-lighted streets, the hurrying passengers,  with a comfortable sense of security and rest.
 But when she was set down  near Guilford Square, her courage, which in real danger had never failed  her, suddenly ebbed away, and left her merely a young girl, with aching  back and weary limbs, with a shrinking dislike of walking alone so late  in the evening.
 Worse of all, her old childish panic had taken hold of  her once more; her knees trembled beneath her, as she remembered that  she must pass the spy, who would assuredly still be keeping watch in  Guilford Terrace.
 The dread of being secretly watched had always been a  torment to her.
 Spies, sometimes real, sometimes imaginary, had been the  terror of her childhood had taken the place of the ghost and bogy panics  which assail children brought up in other creeds.
    The fact was, she had been living at very high pressure, and she was too  much exhausted to conquer her unreasonable fright, which increased every  moment, until she was on the point of going to the Osmonds, willing to  frame any excuse for so late a visit if only she could get one of them  to walk home with her.
 Honesty and shame hindered her, however, With a  great effort of will she forced herself to pass the door, horrified to  find how nearly selfish cowardice had induced her to draw her friends  into suspicion.
 Echoes of the hymns sung at her baptism, and at the  subsequent confirmation rang in her ears.
 She walked on more bravely.
    By the time she reached Guilford Terrace, she had herself quite in hand.
  And it was well; for, as she walked down the dreary little alley, a dark  form emerged from the shadow, and suddenly confronted her.
    Any one might reasonably be a little startled by having a sudden pause  made before them by an unknown person on a dark night.
 Erica thought  she could exactly sympathize with a shying horse; she felt very much  inclined to swerve aside.
 Fortunately she betrayed no fear, only a  little surprise, as she lifted her head and looked the man full in the  face, then moved on with quiet dignity.
 She felt him follow her to  the very door, and purposely she took out her latch key with great  deliberation, and allowed him, if he pleased, to take a quiet survey  of the passage while she rubbed her boots on the mat; then, with a  delicious sense of safety, she closed the door on the unfriendly gaze.
.
    In the meantime, Raeburn had spent a miserably anxious evening,  regretting his rash permission for Erica to go, regretting his own  enforced inaction, regretting his well-known and undisguisable face and  form, almost regretting that his friend had visited him.
 Like Erica,  he was only personally brave; he could not be brave for other people.
  Actual risk he would have enjoyed, but this anxious waiting was to him  the keenest torture.
    When at length the age-long hour had passed, and he heard the front door  close, he started up with an exclamation of relief, and hurried out into  the passage.
 Erica greeted him with her brightest smile.
    "All safe," she said, following him into the study.
 "He is well on his  way to Folkestone, and we have eluded three spies.
"    Then, with a good deal of humor, she related the whole of the adventure,  at the same time taking off her hat and gloves.
    "And you met no one you knew?" asked Raeburn.
    "Only the bishop who baptized and confirmed me this evening, and he of  course did not recognize me.
"    As she spoke, she unbuttoned her ulster, disclosing beneath it her white  serge dress.
    Raeburn sighed.
 Words and sight both reawakened a grief which he would  fain have put from him.
    But Erica came and sat down on the hearth rug, and nestled up to him  just as usual.
 "I am so tired, padre mio!" she exclaimed.
 "But it has  been well worth it.
"    Raeburn did not answer.
 She looked up in his face.
    "What are you thinking?"    "I was thinking that few people had such an ending to their confirmation  day," said Raeburn.
    "I thank God for it," said Erica.
 "Oh, father! There is so much, so very  much we still have in common! And I am so glad this happened tonight of  all nights!"    He stroked her hair caressingly, but did not speak.
        .
 The New Relations         For all men live and judge amiss       Whose talents jump not just with his.

       (And for such doing they require not eyes).
  Matthew Arnold    One bright afternoon about a week after this, Erica found herself  actually in the train, and on her way to Greyshot.
 At first she had  disliked the idea, but her father had evidently wished her to accept  the invitation, and a hope of uniting again the two families would have  stimulated her to a much more formidable undertaking than a visit of a  few weeks to perfect strangers.
 She knew nothing of the proposal made to  her father; her own letter had been most kind, and after all, though she  did not like the actual leaving home, she could not but look forward to  a rest and change after the long summer months in town.
 Moreover, Aunt  Jean had just returned, after a brief holiday, and the home atmosphere  for the last two or three days had been very trying; she felt as if  a change would make her better able to bear the small daily frets and  annoyances, and not unnaturally looked forward to the delicious rest of  unity.
 A Christian home ought to be delightful; she had never stayed in  one, and had a high ideal.
    It was about six o'clock by the time she reached her journey's end, and,  waiting for her on the platform, she had no difficulty in recognizing  her aunt, a taller and fairer edition of Mrs. Craigie, who received her  with a kind, nervous diffident greeting, and seemed very anxious indeed  about her luggage, which was speedily brought to light by the  footman, and safely conveyed to the carriage.
 Erica, used to complete  independence, felt as if she were being transformed into a sort of  grown-up baby, as she was relieved of her bag and umbrella and guided  down the steps, and assisted into the open landau, and carefully tucked  in with a carriage rug.
    "I hope you are not overtired with the journey?" inquired her aunt with  an air of the kindest and most anxious solicitude.
    Accustomed to a really hard life in London, Erica almost laughed at the  idea of being overtired by such a short journey.
    "Oh, I have enjoyed it, thank you," she replied.
 "What a lovely line it  is!"    "Is it?" said her aunt, a little surprised.
 "I didn't know it was  considered specially pretty, and I myself am never able to look much at  the scenery in traveling; it always gives me a headache.
"    "What a pity!" said Erica.
 "It is such a treat, I think.
 In fact, it  is the only way in which I have seen what people call scenery.
 I never  stayed in the country in my life.
"    "My dear, is it possible," exclaimed Mrs. Fane-Smith, in a horrified  voice.
 "Yet you do not look pale.
 Do you mean that you have spent your  whole life in town?"    "I was at Paris for two years," said Erica; "and twice I have spent a  little time at the sea-side; and, years and years ago, father was once  taken ill at Southampton, and we went to him there that was almost like  the country I mean, one could get country walks.
 It was delightful;  there was a splendid avenue, you know, and oh, such a common! It was  in the spring time.
 I shall never forget the yellow gorse and the  hawthorns, and such beautiful velvety grass.
"    Her enthusiasm pleased her aunt; moreover, it was a great relief to find  the unknown niece well-bred and companionable, and not overburdened  with shyness.
 Already Mrs. Fane-Smith loved her, and felt that the  invitation, which she had given really from a strong sense of duty, was  likely to give her pleasure instead of discomfort.
 All the way home,  while Erica admired the Greyshot streets, and asked questions about the  various buildings, Mrs. Fane-Smith was rejoicing that so fair a "brand,"  as she mentally expressed it, had been "plucked from the burning,"  and resolving that she would adopt her as a second daughter, and,  if possible, induce her to take their name and drop the notorious  "Raeburn.
" The relief was great, for on the way to the station, Mrs.  Fane-Smith had been revolving the unpleasant thought in her mind that  "really there was no knowing, Erica might be 'anything' since her mother  was a 'nobody.
'"    At last they drew up before a large house in the most fashionable of  the Greyshot squares, the windows and balconies of which were gay with  flowers.
    "We shall find Rose at home, I expect," said Mrs. Fane-Smith, leading  Erica across a marble-paved hall, and even as she spoke a merry voice  came from the staircase, and down ran a fair-haired girl, with a  charmingly eager and naive manner.
    Erica had guessed what she must be from the quaint and kindly meant  letter which she had sent her years before, and though five years in  society had somewhat artificialized Rose, she still retained much of  her childishness and impetuous honesty.
 She slipped her arm into her  cousin's, and took her off to her room at once.
    "I am so glad you have come!" she exclaimed.
 "I have been longing to  see you for years and years.
 Mamma has been talking so much about your  cleverness and my stupidity that just at the last I felt quite in a  fright lest you should be too dreadfully 'blue.
' I looked out of the  drawing room window for you, and if you had been very forbidding I  should have received you in state in the drawing room, but you were so  charmingly pretty that I was obliged to rush down headlong to meet you.
"    Erica laughed and blushed, not being used to such broad compliments.
 In  the meantime, they had traversed several flights of stairs, and Rose,  opening a door, showed her into a spacious bedroom, most luxuriously  fitted up.
    "This great big room for me!" exclaimed Erica.
    "It isn't at all ghostly," said Rose, reassuringly.
 "Will you be afraid  if you have a night light?"    Erica laughed at the idea of being afraid; she was merely amused to  think of herself established in such a palatial bedroom, such a contrast  to the little book-lined room at home.
 There was a dainty little book  case here, however, with some beautifully bound books, and in another  minute she was delightedly scanning their titles, and, with a joyous  exclamation, had caught up Browning's "Christmas-eve and Easter-day,"  when a sound of dismay from her cousin made her laughingly put it down  again.
    "Oh, dear me!" said Rose, in a despairing voice, "I am afraid, after  all, you are dreadfully blue.
 Fancy snatching up a Browning like that!"    Erica began to unlock her trunk.
    "Do you want your things out?" said Rose.
 "I'll ring for Gemma; she'll  unpack for you.
"    "Oh, thank you," said Erica, "I would much rather do it myself.
"    "But it is nearly dinner time, we are dining early this evening, and you  will want Gemma to help you to dress.
"    "Oh, no," said Erica, laughing, "I never had a maid in my life.
"    "How funny," said Rose, "I shouldn't know what to do without one.
 Gemma  does everything for me, at least everything that Elspeth will let her.
"    "Is she Italian?" asked Erica.
    "Oh, no, her name is really Jemima; but that was quite too dreadfully  ugly, you know, and she is such a pretty girl.
"    She chattered on while Erica unpacked and put on her white serge, then  they went down to the drawing room where Erica was introduced to her  host, a small elderly man, who looked as if the Indian sun had partially  frizzled him.
 He received her kindly, but with a sort of ceremonious  stiffness which made her feel less perfectly at her east than before,  and after the usual remarks about the length of the journey, and the  beauty of the weather, he relapsed into silence, surveying every one  from his arm chair as though he were passing mental judgments on every  foolish or trifling remark uttered.
 In reality, he was taking in every  particular about Erica.
 He looked at her broad forehead, overshadowed by  the thick smooth waves of short auburn hair, observed her golden-brown  eyes which were just now as clear as amber; noted the creamy whiteness  and delicate coloring of her complexion, which indeed defied criticism  even the criticism of such a critical man as Mr. Fane-Smith.
 The nose  was perhaps a trifle too long, the chin too prominent, for ideal beauty,  but greater regularity of feature could but have rendered less quaint,  less powerful, and less attractive the strangely winsome face.
 It was  only the mouth which he did not feel satisfied with it added character  to the face, but he somehow felt that it betokened a nature not easily  led, not so gentle and pliable as he could have wished.
 It shut so very  firmly and the under lip was a little thinner and straighter than the  other and receded a little from it, giving the impression that Erica had  borne much suffering, and had exercised great self-restraint.
    Mrs. Fane-Smith saw in her a sort of miniature and feminine edition of  the Luke Raeburn whom she remembered eight-and-twenty years before in  their Scottish home.
 When Rose had gone into the back drawing room to  fetch her crewels, she drew Erica toward her, and kissing her again,  said in a low, almost frightened voice:    "You are very like what your father was.
"    But just at that moment Mr. Fane-Smith asked some sudden question, and  his wife, starting and coloring, as though she had been detected in  wrong-doing, hurriedly and nervously devoted herself to what seemed  to Erica a distractingly round-about answer.
 By the time it was fairly  ended, dinner was announced, and the strangeness of the atmosphere of  this new home struck more and more upon Erica and chilled her a little.
  The massive grandeur of the old oak furniture, the huge oil paintings,  which she wanted really to study, the great silver candelabra, even the  two footmen and the solemn old butler seemed to oppress her.
 The luxury  was almost burdensome.
 It was a treat indeed to see and use beautiful  glass and china, and pleasant to have beautiful fruit and flowers to  look at, but Erica was a bohemian and hated stiff ceremony Her heart  failed her when she thought of sitting down night after night to such an  interminable meal.
 Worse still, she had taken a dislike to her host.
 Her  likes and dislikes were always characterized by Highland intensity, and  something in her aunt's husband seemed to rub her the wrong way.
 Mr.  Fane-Smith was a retired Indian judge, a man much respected in the  religious world, and in his way a really good man; but undoubtedly his  sympathies were narrow and his creed hard.
 Closely intwined with much  true and active Christianity, he had allowed to spring up a choking  overgrowth of hard criticism, of intolerance, of domineering dogmatism.
  He was one of those men who go about the world, trying, not to find  points of union with all men, but ferreting out the most trifling points  of divergence.
 He did this with the best intentions, no doubt, but as  Erica's whole view of life, and of Christian life in particular, was the  direct opposite of his, their natures inevitably jarred.
    She knew that it was foolish to expect every Christian household to be  equal to the Osmonds', but nevertheless a bitter sense of disappointment  stole over her that evening.
 Where was the sense of restful unity which  she had looked forward to? The new atmosphere felt strange, the new  order of life this luxurious easy life was hard to comprehend.
    To add to her dislike Mr. Fane-Smith was something of an epicure and had  a most fastidious palate.
 Now, Erica's father thought scarcely anything  about what he ate it was indeed upon record that he had once in a fit  of absence dined upon a plate of scraps intended for Friskarina,  while engaged in some scientific discussion with the professor.
 Mr.  Fane-Smith, on the other hand, though convinced that the motto of all  atheists was "Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die," criticized his  food almost as severely as he criticized human beings.
 The mulligatawny  was not to his taste.
 The curry was too not.
 He was sure the jelly  was made with that detestable stuff gelatine; he wished his wife would  forbid the cook to use it if she had seen old horses being led into a  gelatine manufactory as he had seen, she would be more particular.
    Interspersed between these compliments was conversation which irritated  Erica even more.
 It was chiefly about the sayings and doings of people  whom she did not know, and the doings of some clergyman in a neighboring  town seemed to receive severe censure, for Mr. Fane-Smith stigmatized  him as "A most dangerous man, a Pelagian in disguise.
" However, he  seemed to be fond of labeling people with the names of old heresies,  for, presently, when Rose said something about Mr. Farrant, her father  replied contemptuously:    Every one knows, my dear, that Mr. Farrant holds unorthodox views.
 Why,  a few years ago he was an atheist, and now he's a mere Photinian.
    As no one but Mr. Fane-Smith had the faintest idea what a "Photinian"  meant, the accusation could neither be understood nor refuted.
 Mrs.  Fane-Smith looked very uncomfortable, fearing that her niece might feel  hurt at the tone in which "He was an atheist," had been spoken; and  indeed Erica's color did rise.
    "Is that Mr. Farrant the member?" she asked.
    "Yes," replied her aunt, apprehensively.
 "Do you know him?"    "Not personally, but I shall always honor him for the splendid speech he  made last year on religious toleration," said Erica.
    Mr. Fane-Smith raised his eyebrows for the same speech had made him most  indignant.
 However, he began to realize that, before Erica could become  a patient recipient of his opinions, like his wife and daughter, he must  root out the false ideas which evidently still clung to her.
    "Mr. Farrant is no doubt a reformed character now," he admitted.
 "But he  is far from orthodox; far from orthodox! At one time I am told that  he was one of the wildest young fellows in the neighborhood, no decent  person would speak to him, and though no doubt he means well, yet I  could never have confidence in such a man.
"    "I have heard a good deal about him from my friends the Osmonds," said  Erica, stimulated as usual to side with the abused.
 "Mr. Osmond thinks  him the finest character he ever knew.
"    "Is that the clergyman you told me of?" interposed Mrs. Fane-Smith,  anxious to turn the conversation.
    But her husband threw in a question, too.
    "What, Charles Osmond, do you mean the author of 'Essays on Modern  Christianity?"    "Yes," replied Erica.
    "I don't know that he is much more orthodox than Mr. Farrant," said Mr.  Fane-Smith; "I consider that he has Noetian tendencies.
"    Erica's color rose and her eyes flashed.
    "I do not know whether he is what is called orthodox or not," she said;  "but I do know that he is the most Christ-like man I ever met.
"    Mr. Fane-Smith looked uncomfortable.
 He would name any number of  heresies and heretics, but, except at grace, it was against his sense  of etiquette to speak the name of Christ at table.
.
 Even Rose looked  surprised, and Mrs. Fane-Smith colored, and at once made the move to go.
    On the plea of fetching some work, Erica escaped to her own room, and  there tried to cool her cheeks and her temper; but the idea of such a  man as Mr. Fane-Smith sitting in judgment on such men as Mr. Farrant and  Charles Osmond had thoroughly roused her, and she went down still in a  dangerous state a touch would make her anger blaze up.
    "Are you fond of knitting?" asked her aunt, making room for her on the  sofa, and much relieved to find that her niece was not of the unfeminine  "blue" order.
    "I don't really like any work," said Erica, "but, of course, a certain  amount must be done, and I like to knit my father's socks.
"    Mr. Fane-Smith, who had just joined them, took note of this answer, and  it seemed to surprise and displease him, though he made no remark.
    "Did he think that atheists didn't wear socks? Or that their daughters  couldn't knit?" thought Erica to herself, with a little resentful inward  laugh.
    The fact was that Mr. Fane-Smith saw more and more plainly that the  niece whom his wife was so anxious to adopt was by no means his ideal  of a convert.
 Of course he was really and honestly thankful that she had  adopted Christianity, but it chafed him sorely that she had not exactly  adopted his own views.
 He was a man absolutely convinced that there is  but one form of truth, and an exceedingly narrow form he made it, for  all mankind.
 He Mr. Fane-Smith had exactly grasped the whole truth,  and whoever swerved to the right or to the left, if only by a hair's  breadth, was, he considered, in a dangerous and lamentable condition.
  Ah! He thought to himself, if only he had had from the beginning the  opportunity of influencing Erica, instead of that dangerously broad  Charles Osmond.
 It did not strike him that he HAD had the opportunity  ever since his return to England, but had entirely declined to admit an  atheist to his house.
 Other men had labored, and he had entered into the  fruit of their labors, and not finding it quite to his taste, fancied  that he could have managed much better.
    There are few sadder things in the world than to see really good and  well-intentioned men fighting for what they consider the religious cause  with the devil's weapons.
 Mr. Fane-Smith would have been dismayed if  any one could have shown him that all his life he had been struggling  to suppress unbelief by what was infinitely worse than sincere unbelief  denunciation often untrue, always unjust, invariably uncharitable.
 He  would have been almost broken-hearted could he ever have known that  his hard intolerance, his narrowness, his domineering injustice had not  deterred one soul from adopting the views he abhorred, but had, on  the contrary, done a great deal to drive into atheism those who were  wavering.
 And this evening, even while lamenting that he had not been  able to train up his niece exactly in the opinions he himself held, he  was all the time trying her faith more severely than a whole regiment of  atheists could have tried it.
    The time passed heavily enough.
 When two people in the room are unhappy  and uncomfortable, a sense of unrest generally falls upon the other  occupants.
 Rose yawned, talked fitfully about the gayeties of the coming  week, worked half a leaf on an antimacassar, and sang three or four  silly little coquettish songs which somehow jarred on every one.
    Mrs. Fane-Smith, feeling anxious and harassed, afraid alike of vexing  her husband and offending her niece, talked kindly and laboriously.
  Erica turned the heel of her sock and responded as well as she could,  her sensitiveness recoiling almost as much from the labored and  therefore oppressive kindness, as from the irritating and narrow censure  which Mr. Fane-Smith dealt out to the world.
    Family prayers followed.
 It was the first time she had ever been  present at such a household gathering, and the idea seemed to her a very  beautiful one.
 But the function proved so formal and lifeless that it  chilled her more than anything.
 Yet her relations were so very kind to  her personally that she blamed herself for feeling disappointed, and  struggled hard to pierce through the outer shell, which she knew only  concealed their real goodness.
 She knew, too, that she had herself to  blame in part; her oversensitiveness, her quick temper, her want of  deep insight had all had their share in making that evening such a blank  failure.
    Mrs. Fane-Smith went with her into her bedroom to see that she had all  she wanted.
 Though the September evening was mild, a fire blazed in the  grate, much to Erica's astonishment.
 Not on the most freezing of winter  nights had she ever enjoyed such a luxury.
 Her aunt explained that the  room looked north, and, besides, she thought a fire was cheerful and  home-like.
    "You are very kind," said Erica, warmly; "but you know I mustn't let you  spoil me, or I shall not be fit to go back to the home life, and I want  to go home much more fit for it.
"    Something in the spontaneous warmth and confidence of this speech  cheered Mrs. Fane-Smith.
 She wished above all things to win her niece's  love and confidence, and she wisely reserved her proposal as to the  matter of a home for another time.
 It was necessary, however, that  she should give Erica a hint as to the topics likely to irritate Mr.  Fane-Smith.
    "I think, dear," she began, "it would be as well if, when my husband and  Rose are present, you are careful not to speak of your father.
 You won't  mind my saying this; but I know it displeases my husband, and I think  you will understand that there are objections, society, you know, and  public opinion; we must consult it a little.
"    Mrs. Fane-Smith grew nervous and incoherent, threw her arms round her  niece's neck, kissed her most affectionately, and wished her good night.
    When she left the room, Erica's repressed indignation blazed up.
 We fear  it must be recorded that she fairly stamped with anger.
    Wounded in her tenderest part, indignant at the insult to her father,  ashamed of her own want of control, miserably perplexed by her new  surroundings, it was long before she could compose herself.
 She paced  up and down the richly furnished room, struggling hard to conquer her  anger.
 At length, by a happy impulse, she caught up her prayer book,  checked her longing to walk rapidly to and fro, sat down on the Indian  rug before the fire, and read the evening psalm.
 It happened to be the  thirty-seventh.
 Nothing could have calmed her so effectually as its  tender exhortation, its wonderful sympathy with human nature.
 "Fret not  thyself, else shalt thou be moved to do evil.
 Put thou thy trust in the  Lord, and be doing good.
 Put thy trust in Him, and He will bring it to  pass.
"    She closed the book, and sat musing, her anger quite passed away.
    All at once she recollected old Elspeth, the nurse.
 Her father had  charged her with many messages to the faithful old servant, and so had  her aunt.
 She felt ashamed to think that she had been several hours in  the house without delivering them.
 Rose's room was close to hers.
 She  went out, and knocked softly at the door.
    "I just came to see whether Elspeth was here," she said, rather dismayed  to find the candles out, and the room only lighted up by the red glow  from the fire.
    Rose who had had no temper to conquer, was already in bed.
 "Still in your  dress!" she exclaimed.
 "I believe you've been at that Browning again.
  But did no one come to help you? I sent Gemma.
"    "I didn't want help, thank you," said Erica.
 "I only wanted to see  Elspeth because I have a message for her.
"    "How conscientious you are!" said Rose, laughing.
 "I always make a point  of forgetting messages when I go from home.
 Well, you will find Elspeth  in the little room on the next half landing, the work room.
 She was here  not two minutes ago.
 Good night! Breakfast is at nine, you know; and  they'll bring you a cup of tea when they call you.
"    A little shyly, Erica made her way to the work room where Elspeth was  tacking frilling into one of Rose's dresses.
 The old woman started up  with a quick exclamation when she appeared in the doorway.
    "May I come in?" said Erica, with all the charm of manner which she had  inherited from her father.
 "'Tis very late, but I didn't like to go to  bed without seeing you.
"    "I hope missie has everything she wants?" asked Elspeth, anxiously.
    "Yes, indeed!" said Erica.
 "All I want is to see you, and to give you my  father's love, to ask how you are.
 He and Aunt Jean have often told me  about you.
 You have not forgotten them?"    "Forgotten! No, indeed!" cried old Elspeth.
 "When I saw you at 'Takin'  the book,' and saw you so like your poor father, I could have cried.
 You  are Mr. Luke's bairn, and no mistake, my bonny lassie! Ah, I mind the  day well when he came to my room the auld nursery in the parsonage,  where I had reared him and told me that master had ordered him out of  the house.
 I pray God I may never again see a face look as his looked  then!"    Tears started to her eyes at the recollection.
 Erica threw her arms  round her neck, and kissed her.
    "You love him still.
 I see you love him!" she exclaimed, all her feeling  of isolation melting in the assurance of the old servant's sympathy.
    So, after all, Erica had a maid in attendance, for Elspeth insisted on  seeing her to bed, and, since they talked all the time about the old  Scotch days, she was well content to renounce her independence for a  little while.
    But, whether because of the flickering fire light, or because of the  strangeness of the great brass bedstead, with its silken hangings and  many-colored Indian rezai, Erica slept very little that night.
 Perhaps  the long talk about her father's early days had taken too great a hold  of her.
 At any rate, she tossed about very restlessly in her luxurious  quarters, and when, for brief intervals, she slept, it was only to dream  of her father taking leave of his Scottish home, and always he bore that  flint-like face, that look of strong endurance and repressed passion  which Elspeth had described, and which, in times of trouble and  injustice, Erica had learned to know so well.

  Leigh Hunt.
    The irritation, or, at any rate, the novelty of the luxury in the  Fane-Smith's household wore off after Erica had spent a few days at  Greyshot.
 She became accustomed to the great rooms, and being artistic  by nature and the reverse by education, she began very much to enjoy the  pictures, the charming variety of foreign treasures, and particularly  all the lovely things of Indian workmanship with which the drawing room  was crowded.
 The long, formal meals she learned to endure.
 The absurdly  large retinue of servants ceased to oppress her; she used to amuse  herself by speculating as to the political views of the men-servants!  while the luxury of a daily drive with her aunt she very much  appreciated.
    But, though the mere externals were soon familiar enough, she found that  every day increased the difficulty she felt in becoming accustomed to  the atmosphere of this family.
 She had lived all her life with people  who were overwhelmed with work, and in a home where recreation was only  the rare concession to actual health.
 Here recreation seemed to be the  business of life, while work for the public was merely tacked on as a  sort of ornamental fringe.
    Mr. Fane-Smith had, indeed, a few committee meetings to attend; Mrs.  Fane-Smith visited her district once a fortnight, and distributed  tracts, and kind words, and soup tickets, and blanket tickets, besides  the most lavish gifts from her own purse.
 Rose, to please her mother,  taught a class of little girls on Sunday afternoon that is to say, she  did NOT teach them, but she sat in a chair and heard them say collects,  and enforced orderly behavior upon them, and read them a good little  story book.
 But these were merely rather tiresome duties which came in  very often as provoking interruptions to the great business of life,  namely eating, drinking, dining out, giving dinners, or attending  the endless succession of at-homes, dances, musical evenings, amateur  theatricals, by which Greyshot people tried to kill time.
    As to taking any intelligent interest in the political world, no one  seemed to dream of such a thing, except Mr. Fane-Smith, who read the  paper at breakfast, and hurled anathemas at all the statesmen whom Erica  had learned to love and revere.
 It taxed her patience to the utmost to  sit through the daily diatribe against Sir Michael Cunningham, her hero  of heroes.
 But even the violent opposition seemed preferable to the want  of interest shown by the others.
 Mrs. Fane-Smith had time to fritter  away at least half an hour after breakfast in the most desultory  conversation, the most fruitless discussions with Rose as to some detail  of dress; but she always made the excuse that she "had no time" to  read the papers, and amused Erica not a little by asking her husband  if "anything particular had been happening lately," when they were just  starting for a dinner party.
 Out of his little rechauffe of the week's  news she probably extracted enough information to enable her to display  that well-bred interest, that vague and superficial acquaintance with  the subject which will pass muster in society, and which probably  explains alike the very vapid talk and the wildly false accusations  which form the staple of ordinary conversation.
    Rose was even more perplexing.
 She was not only ignorant, but she  boasted of her ignorance.
 Again and again Erica heard her deprecate the  introduction of any public question.
    "Oh, don't begin to talk of that!" she would exclaim.
 "I know nothing  about it, and never mean to know anything.
"    Or there would be an imploring appeal.
    "Why do you waste your time in talking politics when you have never told  me a word about so-and-so's wedding?"    She occasionally read the "Court Circular," and was rather fond of  one or two of the "society" papers from which she used to glean choice  little paragraphs of personal gossip.
    Once one of these papers gave Erica an uncomfortable experience.
 The  elders of the party being out for the evening, Rose and Erica had the  drawing room to themselves, and Erica was really enjoying the rare  novelty of talking with a girl of her own age.
 Rose, although the most  arrant little flirt, was fond, too, of her girl friends, and she  really liked Erica, and enjoyed the fun of initiating her into all the  mysteries and delights of society.
    "How did you get your name?" she asked, suddenly.
 "It is so pretty and  so uncommon.
"    "Oh," said Erica, without thinking, "I was called after my father's  friend, Eric Haeberlein.
"    "Eric Haeberlein?" exclaimed Rose.
 "Why, I was reading something about  him this afternoon.
 Here it is look!" And after searching the columns of  her favorite "society" paper, she pointed to the following paragraph:    "It is now known as a positive fact that the notorious Eric Haeberlein  was actually in London last week in connection with the disgraceful  Kellner business.
 ON DIT that he escaped detection through the  instrumentality of one of the fair sex, whose audacity outweighed her  modesty.
"    Erica could hardly have restrained her indignation had not two real  dangers drawn off her attention from her own wounded feelings.
 Her  father was there any hateful hint that he was mixed up with Herr  Kellner? She glanced anxiously down the page.
 No, at least that  falsehood had not been promulgated.
 She breathed more freely, but there  was danger still, for Rose was watching her, and feminine curiosity is  hard to baffle.
    "Did you know about it?" she asked.
    Erica did not reply for a moment, but read on, to gain time; then she  threw down the paper with an exclamation of disgust.
    "How can you read such stuff?"    "Yes, but is that the Eric Haeberlein you were named after? Did he  really come to London and escape?"    "There is only one Eric Haeberlein in the world that I know of," said  Erica.
 "But I think, Rose, I was wrong and foolish to mention him.
 I  can't tell you anything about him, and, even if I could, there is my  promise to Aunt Isabel.
 If I am not to talk to you about my father, I  certainly ought not to talk about his friends.
"    Rose acquiesced, and never suspected any mystery.
 She chatted on happily  for the rest of the evening, brought down a great collection of old  ball-cards, and with a sort of loving recollection described each very  minutely, just as some old nurses have a way of doing with the funeral  cards of their deceased friends.
 This paved the way for a spontaneous  confession that she really preferred Mr. Torn, the curate of St.
  Matthew's, to Captain Golightly, though people were so stupid, and  would say she was in love with him just because they flirted a little  sometimes.
 Rose had already imagined herself in love with at least  a dozen people, and was quite ready to discuss every one of her  flirtations, but she was disappointed to find that her cousin was either  very reserved on the subject, or else had nothing to say.
    Erica sat listening with a sort of wonder, not unmixed with disgust.
  Perhaps she might have shown her disapprobation had she not been  thankful to have the conversation diverted from the dangerous topic;  besides, the cruel words were still rankling in her heart, and woven in  with Rose's chatter she heard continually, "whose audacity outweighed  her modesty.
" For the first time she fully understood why her father  had so reluctantly consented to her scheme; she began to feel the sting  which lay beneath the words, the veiled "hints," the implied evil, more  wounding, more damaging than an outspoke lie.
 Now that she understood  the ways of society better, she saw, too, that what had seemed to her  an unquestionable duty would be regarded as a grave breach of custom  and etiquette.
 She began to question herself.
 Had she been right? It  mattered very little what the writer of a "society" paper said of her,  if she had done the really right thing.
 What had she done? To save  her father's friend from danger, to save her father from unmerited  suspicion, she had gone out late in the evening with a man considerably  over fifty, whom she had known from her babyhood.
 He had, it is true,  been in the disguise of a young man.
 She had talked to him on the  platform much as she would have talked to Tom, and to save his almost  certain detection, had sprung into the carriage, thrown her arms round  his neck, and kissed him.
 HAD audacity outweighed her modesty? Why, all  the time she had been thanking God for having allowed her to undertake  the difficult task for her father on that particular evening.
 She had  done it in the sight of God, and should she now make herself miserable  because the world was wanting in that charity which "thinketh no evil?"  No, she had been right of that she was certain.
 Nevertheless, she  understood well enough that society would condemn her action, and would  with a smile condone Rose's most outrageous flirtation.
    The first week in a new place always seems long, and Erica felt as if  she had been away from home for months by the time it was over.
 Every  one had been very kind to her so far, but except when she was playing  lawn-tennis she was somehow far from happy.
, Her happiest moments were  really those which she spent in her own room before breakfast, writing;  and the "Daily Review" owed some very lively articles to the Greyshot  visit.
 Beyond a sort of clan feeling for her aunt, and a real liking for  Rose who, in spite of her follies, was good-humored and very lovable  she had not yet found one point of union with her new relations.
 Even  possible topics of conversation were hard to find.
 They cared nothing  for politics, they cared nothing for science, they were none of them  book lovers, and it was against their sense of etiquette to speak of  anything but the externals of religion.
 Worst of all, any allusion to  home matters, any mention of her father had to be avoided.
 Little was  left but the mere gossip of the neighborhood, which, except as a social  study, could not interest Erica.
    Greyshot was an idle place; the church seemed asleep, a drowsy  indifference hung about the richer inhabitants, while the honest  workers not unnaturally banded themself together against the sleepily  respectable church-goers, and secularism and one or two other "isms"  made rapid advances.
 Then sleepy orthodoxy lifted its drowsy head for a  minute, noted the evil, and abused Mr. Raeburn and his fellow workers,  lamenting in many-syllable words the depravity of the working classes  and the rapid spread of infidelity.
 But nothing came of the lament; it  never seemed to strike them that they must act as well as talk, that  they must renounce their useless, wasteful, un-Christian lives before  they had even a right to lift up their voices against secularism, which  certainly did in some measure meet the needs of the people.
 It never  seemed to strike them that THEY were the real promoters of infidelity  that they not only dishonored the name of Christ, but by their  inconsistent lives disgusted people with Christianity, and then refused  to have anything more to do with them.
 Luke Raeburn, if he pulled down  with the one hand, at any rate, tried hard to build up with the other;  but the people of Greyshot caused in a great degree the ruin and down  fall, and then exclaimed, "How shocking!" and turned their backs,  thinking to shift their blame on to the secularist leaders.
    As far as society goes, they succeeded in thus shifting the blame; the  world laid it all on Luke Raeburn, he was a most convenient scapegoat,  and so widely does conventional Christianity differ from the religion  founded by Christ it soon became among a certain set almost equivalent  to a religious act to promulgate bits of personal scandal about  him, flavored, of course, with wordy lamentations as to the views he  entertained.
 Thus, under the name of defenders of religion, conventional  Christians managed to appear very proper and orthodox, and at the same  time to dispose comfortably of all their sense of responsibility.
 There  was a meanness about their way of doing it which might have made the  very angels weep! Happily the judgments of society are not the judgments  of God.
    One of the leaders of society was a certain Lady Caroline Kiteley; she  was a good-natured, hospitable creature, very anxious that every one  should enjoy life, and a great favorite with all the young people,  because she made much of them and gave delightful dances.
 The elders,  too, liked her, and were not oblivious to the fact that she was the  daughter of an earl, and the widow of a distinguished general.
 Erica had  seen her more than once during her visit, and had been introduced to her  by Mrs. Fane-Smith, as "my niece.
"    Now it happened that Mr. And Mrs. Fane-Smith and Rose were to dine with  Lady Caroline the week after Erica's arrival.
 On the very day of the  dinner party, however, Rose was laid up with a bad cold, and her mother  was obliged to write and make her excuses.
 Late in the afternoon there  came in reply one of Lady Caroline's impulsive notes.
    "Dear Mrs. Fane-Smith, Scold that silly daughter of yours for catching  cold; give her my love, and tell her that I was counting on her very  much.
 Please bring your pretty niece instead.
 Yours sincerely, Caroline  Kiteley.
"    Mrs. Fane-Smith was glad and sorry at the same time, and very much  perplexed.
 Such a peremptory but open-hearted invitation could not be  declined, yet there were dangers in the acceptance.
 If Erica's name  should transpire, it might be very awkward, but she had not broached  the suggested change of name to her, and every day her courage dwindled  every day that resolute mouth frightened her more.
 She was quite aware  that Erica's steady, courageous honesty would unsparingly condemn all  her small weaknesses and little expedients.
    Erica, when told of the invitation, was not particularly anxious to go,  for she and Rose had been planning a cozy evening at home over a new  novel upon which their tastes really agreed.
 However, Rose assured her  that Lady Caroline's parties were always delightful, and hunted her off  to dress at least an hour before there was any necessity.
 Rose was a  great authority on dress and, when her cousin returned, began to study  her attire critically.
    She wore a very simply made dress of moss-green velveteen, high to the  throat, and relieved by a deep falling collar of old point.
 Elspeth had  brought her a spray of white banksia roses, but otherwise she wore no  ornament.
 Her style was very different from her cousin's; but Rose could  not help approving of it, its severity suited Erica.
    "You look lovely!" she exclaimed.
 "Lady Caroline will quite lose her  heart to you! I think you should have that dress cut low in front,  though.
 It is a shame not to show such a pretty neck as you must have.
"    "Oh, no!" said Erica, quickly; "father can't endure low dresses.
"    "One can't always dress to please one's father," said Rose.
 "For the  matter of that, I believe papa doesn't like them; but I always  wear them.
 You see it is more economical, one must dress much more  expensively if one goes in for high dresses.
 A little display of neck  and arms, and any old rag will look dressy and fashionable, and though I  don't care about economy, mamma does.
"    "You don't have an allowance, then?"    "No; papa declared I ought to dress on eighty pounds a year, but I never  could make both ends meet, and I got a tiresome long bill at Langdon's,  and that vexed him, so now I get what I like and mamma pays.
"    Erica made no comment, but was not a little amazed.
 Presently Mrs.  Fane-Smith came in, and seemed well pleased with her niece's appearance.
    "You have the old point!" she exclaimed.
    "Aunt Jean gave it to me," said Erica.
 "She never would part with it  because it was grandmamma's at least, she did sell it once, when father  was ill years ago, and we were at our wit's end for money, but she got  it back again before the end of the year.
"    Mrs. Fane-Smith colored deeply, partly at the idea of her mother's  lace being taken to a pawnbroker's, partly to hear that her brother and  sister had ever been reduced to such straits.
 She made an excuse to take  Erica away to her room, and there questioned her more than she had yet  done about her home.
    "I thought your father was so strong," she said.
 "Yet you speak as if he  had had several illnesses.
"    "He has," replied Erica.
 "Twice I can remember the time when they  thought him dying, besides after the riot last year.
 Yes, he is strong,  but, you see, he has such a hard life.
 It is bad enough now, and I doubt  if any one knows how fearfully he overworked himself during the year in  America.
 The other day I had to look something up in his diary for him,  and not till then did I find out how terribly he must have taxed his  strength.
 On an average he got one night's rest in the week, on  the others he slept as well as he could in the long cars, which are  wretchedly uncomfortable; the sleeping cars being expensive, he wouldn't  go in them.
"    Mrs. Fane-Smith sighed.
 Her brother was becoming more of a living  reality to her; she thought of him less as a type of wickedness.
 The  recollection, too, that she had been all her life enjoying the money  which he and her sister Jean had forfeited by their opinions, made her  grieve the more over the little details of poverty and privation.
 Old  Mr. Raeburn had left all his money to her, bequeathing to his other  daughter and his reprobate son the sum of one shilling, with the hope  that Heaven would bring them to a better mind.
 It was some comfort to  learn from Erica that at last the terrible load of debt had been cleared  off, and that they were comparatively free from trouble just at present.
    With these thoughts in her mind, Mrs. Fane-Smith found herself on her  way to Lady Caroline's; but her developing breadth of view was destined  to receive a severe shock.
 They were the last guests to arrive, and at  the very moment of their entrance Lady Caroline was talking in her most  vivacious way to Mr. Cuthbert, a young clergyman, the vicar of one of  the Greyshot churches.
    "I am going to give you a treat, Mr. Cuthbert," she said laughingly.
 "I  know you are artistic, and so I intend you to take down that charming  niece of Mrs. Fane-Smith's.
 I assure you she is like a Burne-Jones  angel!"    Mr. Cuthbert smiled a quietly superior smile, and coolly surveyed Erica  as she came in.
 Dinner was announced almost immediately, and it was not  until Mrs. Fane-Smith had been taken down that Lady Caroline brought Mr.  Cuthbert to Erica's side to introduce him.
 "Why, your aunt has never told  me your name," she said, smiling.
    "My name is Erica Raeburn," said Erica, quite unconscious that this was  a revelation to every one, and that her aunt had purposely spoken of her  everywhere as "my niece.
"    Lady Caroline gave a scarcely perceptible start of surprise, and  there was a curious touch of doubt and constraint in her voice as  she pronounced the "Mr. Cuthbert, Miss Raeburn.
" Undoubtedly that name  sounded rather strangely in her drawing room, and awoke uncomfortable  suggestions.
    "Raeburn! Erica Raeburn!" thought Mr. Cuthbert to himself.
 "Uncommon  name in England.
 Connection, I wonder! Aunt hadn't given her name! That  looks odd.
 I'll see if she has a Scotch accent.
"    "Are you staying in Greyshot?" he asked as they went down the broad  staircase, with its double border of flowering plants.
    "Yes," said Erica; "I came last week.
 What lovely country it is about  here!"    "Country," with its thrilled "r," betrayed her nationality, though her  accent was of the slightest.
 Mr. Cuthbert chuckled to himself, for he  thought he had caught Mrs. Fane-Smith tripping, and he was a man  who derived an immense amount of pleasure from making other people  uncomfortable.
 As a child, he had been a tease; as a big boy, he had  been a bully; as a man, he had become a malicious gossip monger.
 Tonight  he thought he saw a chance of good sport, and directly he had said  grace, in the momentary pause which usually follows, he turned to Erica  with an abrupt, though outwardly courteous question, carried off with a  little laugh.
    "I hope you are no relation to that despicable infidel who bears your  name, Miss Raeburn?"    Erica's color deepened; she almost annihilated him with a flash from her  bright indignant eyes.
    "I am Luke Raeburn's daughter," she said, in her clearest voice, and  with a dignity which, for the time, spoiled Mr. Cuthbert's enjoyment.
    Many people had heard the vicar's question during the pause, and not  a few listened curiously for the answer which, though quietly spoken,  reached many ears, for nothing gives so much penetrating power to words  as concentrated will and keen indignation.
 Before long every one in the  room knew that Mrs. Fane-Smith's pretty niece was actually the daughter  of "that evil and notorious Raeburn.
"    Mr. Cuthbert had certainly got his malicious wish; he had succeeded  in making Mrs. Fane-Smith miserable, in making his hostess furious, in  putting his little neighbor into the most uncomfortable of positions.
 Of  course he was not going to demean himself by talking to "that atheist's  daughter.
" He enjoyed the general discomfiture to his heart's content,  and then devoted himself to the lady on his other side.
    As for Erica her blood was up.
 Forced to sit still, forced even to eat  at a table where she was an unwelcome guest, her anger got the mastery  of her for the time.
 She was indignant at the insult to her father,  indignant, too, that her aunt had ever allowed her to get into such a  false position.
 The very constraint she was forced to put upon herself  made her wrath all the deeper.
 She was no angel yet, though Mr.  Burne-Jones might have taken her for a model.
 She was a quick-tempered  little piece of humanity; her passions burned with Highland intensity,  her sense of indignation was strong and keen, and the atmosphere of  her home, the hard struggle against intolerable bigotry and malicious  persecution had from her very babyhood tended to increase this.
 She had  inherited all her father's passion for justice and much of his excessive  pride, while her delicate physical frame made her far more sensitive.
  Moreover, though since that June morning in the museum she had gained a  peace and happiness of which in the old days she had never dreamed, yet  the entire change had in many ways increased the difficulties of her  life.
 Such a wrench, such an upheaval as it had involved, could not but  tell upon her immensely.
 And, besides, she had in every way for the last  three months been living at high pressure.
    The grief, the disapproval, the contemptuous pity of her secularist  friends had taxed her strength to the utmost, but she had stood firm,  and had indeed been living on the heights.
    Now the months of Charles Osmond's careful preparation were over, her  baptism was over, and a little weary and overdone with all that she had  lived through that summer, she had come down to Greyshot expecting rest,  and behold, fresh vexations had awaited her!    A nice Christian world! A nice type of a clergyman! she thought to  herself, as bitterly as in the old days, and with a touch of sorrow  added.
 The old lines from "Hiawatha," which had been so often on her  lips, now rang in her head:    "For his heart was hot within him, Like a living coal his heart was.
"    She longed to get up and go, but that would have put her aunt in a yet  more painful position, and might have annoyed Lady Caroline even more  than her presence.
 She would have given anything to have fainted after  the convenient fashion of the heroines of romance, but never had she  felt so completely strung up, so conscious of intense vitality.
 There  was nothing for it but endurance.
 And for two mortal hours she had to  sit and endure! Mr. Cuthbert never spoke to her; her neighbor on the  other side glanced at her furtively from time to time, but preserved a  stony silence; there was an uncomfortable cloud on her hostess's brow;  while her aunt, whom she could see at some distance on the other side of  the table, looked very white and wretched.
    It is wonderful how rude people can be, even in good society, and the  looks of "blank amaze," "cold surprise," and "cool curiosity" which  Erica received would hardly be credited.
 A greater purgatory to a  sensitive girl, whose pride was by no means conquered, can hardly be  conceived.
    She choked down a little food, unable to reject everything, but her  throat almost refused to swallow it.
 The glare of the lights, the  oppressive atmosphere, the babel of tongues seemed to beat upon her  brain, and a sick longing for home almost overmastered her.
 Oh, to get  away from these so-called Christians, with their cruel judgments, their  luxuries, their gayeties these hard, rich bigots, who yet belonged to  the body she had just joined, with who, in the eyes of her old friends,  she should be identified! Oh, for the dear old book-lined study at home!  For one moment with her father! One word from a being who loved and  trusted her! Tears started to her eyes, but the recollection that even  home was no longer a place of refuge checked them.
 There would be Aunt  Jean's wearing remonstrances and sarcastic remarks; there would be Mr.  Masterman's patronizing contempt, and Tom's studious avoidance of  the matters she had most at heart.
 Was it worse to be treated as a  well-meaning idiot, or as an outcast and semi-heretic? Never till now  had she so thoroughly realized her isolation, and she felt so bruised  and buffeted and weary that the realization at that particular time was  doubly trying.
    Isolation is perhaps the greatest of all trials to a sensitive and  warm-hearted nature, and nothing but the truest and deepest love for  the whole race can possibly keep an isolated person from growing bitter.
  Erica knew this, had known it ever since Brian had brought her  the message from her mother; "It is only love that can keep from  bitterness.
" All through these years she had been struggling hard, and  though there had been constant temptations, though the harshness of the  bigoted, the insults offered to her father in the name of religion,  the countless slights and slanders had tried her to the utmost, she had  still struggled upward, and in spite of all had grown in love.
 But  now, for the first time, she found herself completely isolated.
 The  injustice, the hardness of it proved too much for her.
 She forgot that  those who would be peace-makers reconcilers, must be content to receive  the treatment which the Prince of Peace received; she forgot that these  rich, contemptuous people were her brothers and sisters, and that their  hard judgment did not and could not alter their relationship; she forgot  all in a burning indignation, in an angry revolt against the injustice  of the world.
    She would study these people, she would note all their little weaknesses  and foibles.
 Mr. Bircham had given her carte blanche for these three  weeks; she would write him a deliciously sarcastic article on modern  society.
 The idea fixed her imagination, she laughed to herself at the  thought; for, however sad the fact, it is nevertheless true that to  ordinary mortals "revenge is sweet.
" Had she given herself time to think  out matters calmly, she would have seen that boh Christianity and the  rules of art were opposed to her idea.
 It is true that Michael Angelo  and other painters used to revenge themselves on the cardinals or  enemies they most hated by painting them in the guise of devils, but  both they and their art suffered by such a concession to an animal  passion.
 And Erica fell grievously that evening.
 This is one of the  evils of social ostracism.
 It is unjust, unnatural, and selfish.
 To  preserve what it considers the dignity of society, it drives human  beings into an unnatural position; it fosters the very evils which it  denounces.
 And society is grossly unfair.
 A word, a breath, a false  libel in a newspaper is quite sufficient.
 It will never trouble itself  to inquire minutely into the truth, but will pronounce its hasty  judgment, and then ostracize.
    Erica began to listen attentively to the conversation, and it must be  owned that it was not very edifying.
 Then she studied the faces and  manners of her companions, and, being almost in the middle of the table,  she had a pretty good view.
 Every creature she studied maliciously,  keenly, sarcastically, until she came to the end of the table, and there  a most beautiful face brought her back to herself for a minute with a  sort of shock.
 Where had she seen it before? A strong, manly face of the  Roman type, clean-shaven, save for a very slight mustache, which did  not conceal the firm yet sensitive mouth; dark eyes, which even as she  wondered met hers fully for an instant, and gave her a strange feeling  of protection.
 She knew that at least one person in the room did not  shudder at the idea of sitting at table with Luke Raeburn's daughter.
    Better thoughts returned to her, she grew a little ashamed of her  malice, and began to wonder who that ideal man could be.
 Apparently he  was one of the distinguished guests, for he had taken down Lady Caroline  herself.
 Erica was just too far off to hear what he said, and in another  moment she was suddenly recalled to Mr. Cuthbert.
 He was talking to the  old gentleman on her left hand, who had been silently surveying her at  intervals as though he fancied she could not be quite human.
    "Have you been following this Kellner trial?" asked Mr. Cuthbert.
  "Disgraceful affair, isn't it?"    Then followed references to Eric Haeberlein, and veiled hints about his  London friends and associates more dangerous to the country than say  foreigners, "traitors, heady, high-minded," etc.
, etc.
 Such evil-doers  always managed to keep within the letter of the law; but, for his part,  he thought they deserved to be shut up, more than most of those who get  penal servitude for life.
    Erica's wrath blazed up again.
 Of course the veiled hints were intended  to refer to her father, and the cruelty and insolence of the speaker  who knew that she understood his allusions scattered all her better  thoughts.
 It required a strong effort of will to keep her anger and  distress from becoming plainly visible.
 Her unwillingness to give  Mr. Cuthbert such a gratification could not have strengthened her  sufficiently, but love and loyalty to her father and Eric Haeberlein had  carried her through worse ordeals than this.
    She showed no trace of embarrassment, but moved a very little further  back in her chair, implying by a sort of quiet dignity of manner, that  she thought Mr. Cuthbert exceedingly ill-mannered to talk across her.
    Feeling that his malicious endeavor had entirely failed, and stung  by her dignified disapproval, Mr. Cuthbert struck out vindictively.
  Breaking the silence he had maintained toward her, he suddenly flashed  round upon her with a question.
    "I suppose you are intimately acquainted with Eric Haeberlein?"    He tried to make his tone casual and seemingly courteous, but failed.
    "What makes you suppose that?" asked Erica, in a cool, quiet voice.
    Her perfect self-control, and her exceedingly embarrassing  counter-question, quite took him aback.
 At that very minute, too,  there was the pause, and the slight movement, and the glance from Lady  Caroline which reminded him that he was the only clergyman present, and  had to return thanks.
 He bent forward, and went through the usual form  of "For what we have received," though all the time he was thinking  of the "counter-check quarrelsome" he had received from his next-door  neighbor.
 When he raised his head again he found her awaiting his  answer, her clear, steady eyes quietly fixed on his face with a look  which was at once sad, indignant, and questioning.
    His question had been an insulting one.
 He had meant it to prick and  sting, but it is one thing to be indirectly rude, and another to give  the "lie direct.
" Her quiet return question, her dignity, made it  impossible for him to insult her openly.
 He was at her mercy.
 He colored  a little, stammered something incoherent about "thinking it possible.
"    "You are perfectly right," replied Erica, still speaking in her quietly  dignified voice.
 "I have known Herr Haeberlein since I was a baby, so  you will understand that it is quite impossible for me to speak with you  about him after hearing the opinions you expressed just now.
"    For once in his life Mr. Cuthbert felt ashamed of himself.
 He did not  feel comfortable all through dessert, and gave a sigh of relief when the  ladies left the room.
    As for Erica's other neighbor, he could not help reflecting that Luke  Raeburn's daughter had had the best of it in the encounter.
 And he  wondered a little that a man, whom he had known to do many a kindly  action, should so completely have forgotten the rules of ordinary  courtesy.
        .
 A Friend         Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us;       but what he, the one man who has understanding of just and       unjust, will say, and what the truth will say.
  And       therefore you begin in error when you suggest that we should       regard the opinion of the many about just and unjust, good       and evil, honorable and dishonorable.
--Plato.
    In the drawing room Erica found the ostracism even more complete and  more embarrassing.
 Lady Caroline who was evidently much annoyed, took  not the slightest notice of her, but was careful to monopolize the one  friendly looking person in the room, a young married lady in pale-blue  silk.
 The other ladies separated into groups of two and threes, and  ignored her existence.
 Lady Caroline's little girl, a child of twelve,  was well bred enough to come toward her with some shy remark, but her  mother called her to the other side of the room quite sharply, and  made some excuse to keep her there, as if contact with Luke Raeburn's  daughter would have polluted her.
    A weary half hour passed.
 Then the door opened, and the gentlemen filed  in.
 Erica, half angry, half tired, and wholly miserable, was revolving  in her brain some stinging sentences for her article when the beautiful  face again checked her.
 Her "Roman," as she called him, had come in, and  was looking round the room, apparently searching for some one.
 At last  their eyes met, and, with a look which said as plainly as words: "Oh,  there you are! It was you I wanted," he came straight towards her.
    "You must forgive me, Miss Raeburn, for dispensing with an  introduction," he said; "but I hardly think we shall need any except the  name of our mutual fried, Charles Osmond.
"    Erica's heart gave a bound.
 The familiar name, the consciousness that  her wretched loneliness was at an end, and above all, the instantaneous  perception of the speaker's nobility and breadth of mind, scattered for  the time all her resentful thoughts made her again her best self.
    "Then you must be Donovan!" she exclaimed, with the quaint and winsome  frankness which was one of her greatest charms.
 "I knew I was sure you  were not like other people.
"    He took her hand in his, and no longer wondered at Brian's seven years'  hopeless waiting.
 But Erica began to realize that her exclamation had  been appallingly unconventional, and the beautiful color deepened in her  cheeks.
    "I beg your pardon," she said, remembering with horror that he was not  only a stranger but an M.
P.
, "I I don't know what made me say that, but  they have always spoken of you by your Christian name, and you have so  long been 'Donovan' in my mind that somehow it slipped out you didn't  feel like a stranger.
"    "I am glad of that," he said, his dark and strangely powerful eyes  looking right into hers.
 Something in that look made her feel positively  akin to him.
 Like a stranger! Of course he had not felt like one.
 Never  could be like anything but a friend.
 "You see," he continued, "we have  known of each other for years, and we know that we have one great bond  of union which others have not.
 Don't retract the 'Donovan' I like it.
  Let it be the outward sign of the real and unusual likeness in the fight  we have fought.
"    She still half hesitated.
 He was a man of five-and-thirty, and she  could not get over the feeling that her impulsive exclamation had been  presumptuous.
 He saw her uncertainty, and perhaps liked her the better  for it, though the delicious naturalness, the child-like recognition of  a real though scarcely known friend, had delighted him.
    "We are a little more brother and sister than the rest of the world," he  said, with the chivalrous manner which seemed to belong naturally to his  peculiarly noble face.
 "And if I were to confess that I had not always  thought of you as 'Miss Raeburn'--"    He paused, and Erica laughed.
 It was absurd to stand on ceremony with  this kindred spirit.
    "Have you seen the conservatory?" he asked.
 "Shall we come in there? I  want to hear all about the Osmonds.
"    The relief of speaking with one who knew and loved Charles Osmond, and  did not, for want of real knowledge, brand him with the names of half a  dozen heresies, was very great.
 It was not for some time that Erica even  glanced at the lovely surroundings, though she had inherited Raeburn's  great love of flowers.
 At last, however, an exquisite white flower  attracted her notice, and she broke off in the middle of a sentence.
    "Oh, how lovely! I never saw anything like that before.
 What is it?"    "It is the EUCHARIS AMAZONICA," replied her companion "About the most  exquisite flower in the world, I should think the 'dove flower,' as  my little ones call it.
 Ir you look at it from a distance the stamens  really look like doves bending down to drink.
"    "It is perfect! How I wish my father could see it!"    "We have a fairly good one at Oakdene, though not equal to this.
 We must  persuade you and Mr. Raeburn to come and stay with us some day.
"    The tears came into Erica's eyes, so great was the contrast between his  friendliness and the chilling discourtesy she had met with from others  that evening.
    "You are very good," she said.
 "If you only knew how hard it is to be  treated as if one were a sort of semi-criminal!"    "I do know," he said.
 "It was this very society which goaded me into  a sort of wild rebellion years ago.
 I deserved its bad opinion in a  measure, and you do not, but it was unfair enough to make one pretty  desperate.
"    "If they were actual saints one might endure it," cried Erica.
 "But to  have such a man as my father condemned just as hearsay by people who  are living lazy, wasteful lives is really too much.
 I came to Greyshot  expecting at least unity, at least, peace in a Christian atmosphere, and  THIS is what I get.
"    Donovan listened in silence, a great sadness in his eyes.
 There was a  pause; then Erica continued: "You think I speak hotly.
 I cannot help it.
  I think I do not much mind what they do to me, but it is the injustice  of the thing that makes one wild, and worst of all, the knowing that  this is what drives people into atheism this is what dishonors the name  of Christ.
"    "You are right," he replied, with a sigh; "that IS the worst of it.
 I  have come to the conclusion that to be tolerant to the intolerant is the  most difficult thing in life.
"    "You must have plenty of practice in this dreadful place," said Erica.
    He smiled a little.
    "Why, to be seen talking to ME will make people say all sorts of evil of  you," she added.
 "I wish I had thought of that before.
"    "You wouldn't have spoken to me?" asked Donovan, laughing.
 "Then I am  very glad it didn't occur to you.
 But about that you may be quite easy;  nothing could make them think much worse of me than they do already.
 I  began life as the black sheep of the neighborhood, and it is easier for  the Ethiopian to change his skin than for a man to live down the past  in public opinion.
 I shall be, at any rate, the dusky gray sheep of the  place to the end of my life.
"    There was no bitterness, no shade of complaint in his tone; he merely  stated a fact.
 Erica was amazed; she knew that he was about the only man  who attempted to grapple with the evil and degradation and poverty of  Greyshot.
    "You see," he continued, with a bright look which seemed to raise Erica  into purer atmosphere, "it is not the public estimation which makes a  man's character.
 There is one question, which I think we ought never to  ask ourselves, and that is 'What will people think of me?' It should be  instead: 'How can I serve?'"    "But if they take away your power, how can you serve?"    "They can't take it away; they may check and hinder for a time, that is  all.
 I believe one may serve always and everywhere.
"    "You don't mean that I can serve that roomful of enemies in there?"    "That is exactly what I do mean," he answered, smiling a little.
    In the meantime, Lady Caroline was apologizing to Mr. Cuthbert.
    "I don't know when I have been so vexed!" she exclaimed.
 "It is really  too bad of Mrs. Fane-Smith.
 I had no idea that the Burne-Jones angel I  promised you was the daughter of that disgraceful man.
 What a horrible  satire, is it not?"    "Pray, don't apologize," said Mr. Cuthbert.
 "It was really rather  amusing than otherwise, and I fancy the young lady will be in no great  hurry to force her way into society again.
"    He laughed a soft, malicious, chuckling laugh.
    "I should hope not, indeed," said Lady Caroline, indignantly.
 "Where has  she disappeared to?"    "Need you ask?" said Mr. Cuthbert, smiling.
 "Our revered member secured  her at once, and has been talking to her in the conservatory for at  least half an hour, hatching radical plots, I dare say, and vowing  vengeance on all aristocrats.
"    "Really it is too shocking!" said Lady Caroline.
 "Mr. Farrant has no  sense of what is fitting; it is a trait which I have always noticed in  Radicals.
 He ought, at least to have some respect for his position.
"    "Birds of a feather flock together," suggested Mr. Cuthbert, with his  malicious smile.
    "Well, I don't often defend Mr. Farrant," said Lady Caroline.
 "But  he comes of a good old family, and, though a Radical, he is at least  respectable.
"    Lady Caroline knew absolutely nothing about Erica, but uttered the last  sentence, with its vague, far-reaching, and most damaging hint, without  even a pricking of conscience.
    "You will try to rescue the M.
P.
?" asked Mr. Cuthbert.
    "For the sake of his position, yes," said Lady Caroline, entering the  conservatory.
    "Oh! Mr. Farrant," she said, with her most gracious smile, "I came to  see whether you couldn't induce your wife to sing to us.
 Now, is it  true that she has given up her music? I assure you she and I have been  battling the point ever since you came up.
 Can't you persuade her to  give us just one song? I am really in despair for some music.
"    "I am afraid my wife is quite out of voice," said Donovan.
 "Are there no  other musical people?"    "Not one.
 It is really most astonishing.
 I was counting on Miss  Fane-Smith, but she has disappointed me, and there is not another  creature who will play or sing a note.
 Greyshot is a terrible unmusical  place.
"    "You do not belong to Greyshot, so perhaps you may be able to come to  the rescue," said Donovan to Erica.
 "Scotch people can, at any rate,  always play or sing their own national airs as no one else can.
"    Lady Caroline did not really in the least care whether there were music  or not, but she had expressed herself very strongly, and that tiresome  Mr. Farrant had taken her at her word, and was trying to beat  up recruits recruits that she did not want.
 He had now, whether  intentionally or not, put her in such a position that, unless she were  positively rude, she must ask Erica to play or sing.
    "Have you brought any music, Miss Raeburn?" she asked, turning to  Erica with a chilling look, as though she had just become aware of her  presence.
    "I have none to bring," said Erica.
 "I do not profess to sing; I only  sing our own Scotch airs.
"    "Exactly what I said!" exclaimed Donovan.
 "And Scotch singing of Scotch  airs is like nothing else in the world.
"    Whether he mesmerized them both, or whether his stronger will and higher  purpose prevailed, it would be hard to say.
 Certainly Erica was quite as  unwilling to sing as Lady Caroline was to favor her with a request.
 Both  had to yield, however, and Erica, whether she would or not, had to serve  her roomful of enemies and a great deal of good it did her.
    Out of the quiet conservatory they came into the heat and glare and  babel of voices; Lady Caroline feeling as if she had been caught in her  own trap, Erica wavering between resentful defiance and the desire to  substitute Donovan's "How can I serve?" for "What do they think?"    She sat down to the piano, which was in a far-away corner, and soon she  had forgotten her audience altogether.
 Although she had had little time  or opportunity for a thorough musical education, she had great taste,  and was musical by nature; she sang her national airs, as very few could  have sung them, and so wild and pathetic was the air she had chosen,  "The Flowers of the Forest," that the roar of conversation at once  ceased.
 She knew nothing whatever about the listeners; the air had taken  her back to her father's recovery at Codrington the year before.
 She was  singing to him once more.
    The old gentleman who had sat on her right hand at dinner came up now  with his first remark.
    "Thank you, that was a real treat, and a very rare treat.
 I wonder  whether you would sing an old favorite of mine 'Oh, why did ye gang,  lassie?'"    Erica at once complied, and there was such pathos in her low, clear  voice, that tears stood in the eyes of more than one listener.
 She  had never dared to sing that song at home since one evening some weeks  before, when her father had just walked out of the room, unable to bear  the mournful refrain "I never, never thought ye wad leave me!" The song  was closely associated with the story of that summer, and she sang it to  perfection.
    Donovan Farrant came toward her again at the close.
    "I want to introduce my wife to you," he said.
    And Erica found that the young married lady in the pale-blue silk, whom  she had singled out as the one approachable lady in the room, was Mrs.  Farrant.
 She was very bright, and sunshiny, and talkative.
 Erica liked  her, and would have liked her still better had not the last week shown  her so much of the unreality and insincerity of society that she half  doubted whether any one she met in Greyshot could be quite true.
 Mrs.  Farrant's manner was charming, but charming manners had often turned out  to be exceedingly artificial, and Erica, who was in rather a hard mood,  would not let herself be won over, but held her judgment in suspension,  responding brightly enough to her companion's talk, but keeping the best  part of herself in reserve.
    At length the evening ended, and the guests gradually dispersed.
 Mr.  Cuthbert walked across the road to his vicarage, still chuckling  to himself as he thought of the general discomfiture caused by his  question.
 The musical old gentleman returned to his home revolving a  startling new idea; after all, might not the Raeburns and such people  be very much like the rest of the world? Were they not probably as  susceptible to pain and pleasure, to comfort and discomfort, to  rudeness and civility? He regretted very much that he had not broken the  miserably uncomfortable silence at dinner.
    Donovan Farrant and his wife were already far from Greyshot, driving  along the quiet country road to Oakdene Manor.
    "A lovely girl," Mrs. Farrant was saying.
 "I should like to know her  better.
 Tonight I had the feeling somehow that she was purposely keeping  on the surface of things, one came every now and then to a sort of wall,  a kind of hard reserve.
"    "Who can wonder!" exclaimed Donovan.
 "I am afraid, Gladys, the old  proverb will have a very fair chance of being fulfilled.
 That child has  come out seeking wool, and as likely as not she'll go home shorn.
"    "Society can be very cruel!" signed Gladys.
 "I did so long to get to her  after dinner; but Lady Caroline kept me, I do believe, purposely.
"    "Lady Caroline and Mr. Cuthbert will little dream of the harm they have  done," said Donovan.
 "I think I understand as I never understood before  the burning indignation of that rebuke to the Pharisees 'Full well ye  reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own traditions.
'"    In the meantime there was dead silence in the Fane-Smiths' carriage,  an ominous silence.
 There was an unmistakable cloud on Mr. Fane-Smith's  face; he had been exceedingly annoyed at what had taken place, and with  native perversity, attributed it all to Erica.
 His wife was miserable.
  She felt that her intended kindness had proved a complete failure;  she was afraid of her husband's clouded brow, still more afraid of her  niece's firmly closed mouth, most afraid of all at the thought of Lady  Caroline's displeasure.
 Nervous and overwrought, anxious to conciliate  all parties, and afraid of making matters worse, she timidly went into  Erica's room, and after beating about the bush for a minute or two,  plunged rashly into the sore subject.
    "I am so sorry, dear, about tonight," she said.
 "I wish it could have  been prevented.
"    Erica, standing up straight and tall in her velveteen dress, with a  white shawl half thrown back from her shoulders, looked to her aunt  terribly dignified and uncompromising.
    "I can't say that I thought them courteous," she replied.
    "It was altogether unfortunate," said Mrs. Fane-Smith, hurriedly.
 "I  hoped your name would not transpire; I ought to have suggested the  change to you before, but--"    "What change?" asked Erica, her forehead contracting a little.
    "We thought we hoped that perhaps, if you adopted our name, it might  prevent unpleasantness.
 Such things are done, you know, and then, too,  we might make some arrangement about your grandfather's money, a part  of which I feel is now yours by right.
 Even now the change would show  people the truth, would save many disagreeables.
"    During this speech Erica's face had been a study; an angry glow of color  rushed to her cheeks, her eyes flashed dangerously.
 She was a young  girl, but there was a good deal of the lion about her at that minute,  and her aunt trembled listening perforce to the indignant outburst.
    "What truth would it show?" she cried.
 "I don't believe there is such  a thing as truth among all these wretched shams! I will never change  my name to escape from prejudice and bigotry, or to win a share in my  grandfather's property! What! Give up my father's name to gain the money  which might have kept him from pain and ruin and semi-starvation? Take  the money that might have brought comfort to my mother that might have  kept me with her to the end.
 I couldn't take it.
 I would rather die  than touch one penny of it.
 It is too late now.
 If you thought I would  consent if that is the reason you asked me here, I can go at once.
 I  would not willingly have brought shame upon you, but neither will I  dishonor myself nor insult my father by changing my name.
 Why, to do so  would be to proclaim that I judged him as those Pharisees did tonight.
  The hypocrites! Which of them can show one grain of love for the race,  to set against my father's life of absolute devotion? They sit over  their champagne and slander atheists, and then have the face to call  themselves Christians.
"    "My dear!" said Mrs. Fane-Smith, nervously.
 "Our only wish is to do what  is best for you; but you are too tired and excited to discuss this now.
  I will wish you good night.
"    "I never wish to discuss it again, thank you," said Erica, submitting to  a particularly warm embrace.
    Mrs. Fane-Smith was right in one way.
 Erica was intensely excited.
 When  people have been riding rough-shod over one's heart, one is apt to be  excited, and Luke Raeburn's daughter had inherited that burning sense  of indignation which was so strongly marked a characteristic in Raeburn  himself.
 Violins can be more sweet and delicate in tone than any other  instrument, but they can also wail with greater pathos, and produce a  more fearful storm of passion.
    Declining any assistance from Gemma, Erica locked her door, caught  up some sheets of foolscap, snatched up her pen, and began to write  rapidly.
 She knew well enough that she ought not to have written.
 But  when the heart is hot with indignation, when the brain produces scathing  sentences, when the subject seems to have taken possession of the whole  being, to deny its utterance is quite the hardest thing in the world.
    Erica struggled to resist, but at length yielded, and out rushed  sarcasms, denunciations, return blows innumerable! The relief was great.
  However, her enjoyment was but short for by the time her article was  rolled up for the post, stamped and directed, her physical powers gave  way; such blank exhaustion ensuing that all she could do was to drag  herself across the room, throw herself, half dressed, on the bed, draw  the rezai over her, and yield to the heavy, overpowering slumber of  great weariness.
    It seemed to her that she slept about five minutes, and was then  roused by a knocking at her door.
 She started up, and found that it was  morning.
 Then she recollected bolting her door, and sprung out of bed  to undo it, but was reminded at once that she had a spine.
 She had  quite recovered from the effects of her illness, but over-fatigue always  brought back the old pain, and warned her that she must be more careful  in the future.
 The house maid seemed a little surprised not to find  her up and dressed as usual, for Erica generally got through an hour's  writing before the nine o'clock breakfast.
    "Are you ill, miss?" she asked, glancing at the face which seemed almost  as colorless as the pillow.
    "Only very tired, thank you," said Erica, glad enough today of the cup  of tea and the thin bread and butter which before had seemed to her such  an absurd luxury.
    "Letters for the early post, miss, I suppose?" said the house maid,  taking up the fiery effusion.
    "Please," replied Erica, not turning her head, and far too weary to give  a thought to her last night's work.
 All she could think of just then was  the usual waking reflection of a sufferer "How in the world shall I get  through the day?"    The recollection, however, of her parting conversation with her aunt  made her determined to be down to breakfast.
 Her absence might be  misconstrued.
 And though feeling ill-prepared for remonstrance or  argument, she was in her place when the gong sounded for prayers,  looking white and weary indeed, but with a curve of resoluteness about  her mouth.
 Nobody found out how tired she was.
 Mr. Fane-Smith was as  blind as a bat, and Mrs. Fane-Smith was too low-spirited and too much  absorbed with her own cares to notice.
 The events of last night looked  more and more disagreeable, and she was burdened with thoughts of what  people would say; moreover, Rose's cold was much worse, and as her  mother was miserable if even her little finger ached, she was greatly  disturbed, and persuaded herself that her child was really in a most  dangerous state.
    Breakfast proved a very silent meal that morning, quite oppressively  silent; Erica felt like a child in disgrace.
 Every now and then the  grimness of it appealed to her sense of the ludicrous, and she felt  inclined to scream or do something desperate just to see what would  happen.
 At length the dreary repast came to an end, and she had just  taken up a newspaper, with a sort of gasp of relief at the thought of  escaping for a moment into a larger world, when she was recalled to the  narrow circle of Greyshot by a word from Mr. Fane-Smith.
    "I wish to have a talk with you, my dear; will you come to the library  at ten o'clock?"    An interview by appointment! That sounded formidable! When the time  came, Erica went rather apprehensively to the library, fearing that she  was in for an argument, and wishing that Mr. Fane-Smith had chosen a day  on which she felt a little more up to things.
    He received her very kindly, and drew an easy chair up to the fire for  her, no doubt doing as he would be done by, for he was a chilly  Indian mortal.
 Erica had never been into the library before.
 It was a  delightful room, furnished with old carved oak and carpeted with soft  Indian rugs.
 Though dignified by the name of library, it was not nearly  so crowded with books as the little study at home; all the volumes were  beautifully bound in much-begilt calf or morocco, but they had not the  used, loved look of her father's books.
 On the mantel piece there were  some models of Indian idols exquisitely carved in soft, greenish-gray  soapstone, and behind these, as if in protest, lurked the only  unornamental thing in the room, a very ordinary missionary box, covered  with orange-colored paper and impressively black negroes.
    "I am sure, my dear," said Mr. Fane-Smith, "that after what occurred  last night you will see the desirability of thinking seriously about  your plans for the future.
 I have been intending to speak to you, but  waited until we had learned to know each other a little.
 However, I  regret now that I delayed.
 It is naturally far from desirable that you  should remain an inmate of your father's house, and my wife and I should  be very glad if you would make your home with us.
 Of course when it was  fully understood in Greyshot that you had utterly renounced your father  and your former friends, such unpleasantness as you encountered  last night would not again occur; indeed, I fancy you would become  exceedingly popular.
 It would perhaps have been wiser if you would have  taken our name, but your aunt tells me you object to that.
"    "Yes," said Erica, who was writhing with anger, and relieved herself by  the slight sarcasm, "I do object to be Miss Feign-Fane-Smith.
"    "Well, that must be as you please," he resumed; "but I really think if  you will accept our offer it will be for your ultimate good.
"    He proceeded to enumerate all the benefits which would accrue to her;  then paused.
    Erica was silent for a minute.
 When she spoke it was in the low voice of  one who is struggling to restrain passion.
    "I am sure you mean this very kindly," she said.
 "I have tried to listen  to your offer patiently, though, of course, the moment you began, I knew  that I must entirely emphatically, decline it.
 I will NEVER leave my  father!"    The last words were spoken with a sort of half-restrained outburst, as  if the pent-up passion must find some outlet.
    Mr. Fane-Smith was startled.
 He so seldom thought of Luke Raeburn as a  fellow-being at all that perhaps it had never occurred to him that the  love of parent to child, and child to parent, is quite independent of  creed.
    "But, my dear," he said, "you have been baptized.
"    "I have.
"    "You promised to renounce the devil and all his works.
"    "I did.
"    "Then how can you hesitate to renounce everything connected with your  former life?"    "Do you mean to imply that my father is the devil or one of his works?"    Mr. Fane-Smith was silent.
 Erica continued:    "God's Fatherhood does not depend on our knowledge of it, or acceptance  of it, it is a fact a truth! How then can any one dare to say that such  a man as my farther is a work of the devil? I thought the sin of sins  was to attribute to the devil what belongs to God!"    "You are in a very peculiar position," said Mr. Fane-Smith, uneasily.
  "And I have no doubt it is difficult for you to see things as they  really are.
 But I, who can look at the matter dispassionately, can see  that your remaining in your old home would be most dangerous, and not  only that, but most painful! To live in a house where you hear all that  you most reverence evil spoken of; why, the pain would be unspeakable!"    "I know that," said Erica, in a low voice, "I have found that I admit  that it is and always will be harder to bear than any one can conceive  who has not tried.
 But to shirk pain is not to follow Christ.
 As to  danger, if you will forgive my saying so, I should find a luxurious life  in a place like Greyshot infinitely more trying.
"    "Then could you not take up nursing? Or go into some sisterhood? Nothing  extreme, you know, but just a working sisterhood.
"    Erica smiled, and shook her head.
    "Why should I try to make another vocation when God has already given me  one?"    "But, my dear, consider the benefit to your own soul.
"    "A very secondary consideration!" exclaimed Erica, impetuously.
    "I should have thought," continued Mr. Fane-Smith, "that under such  strange circumstances you would have seen how necessary it was to  forsake all.
 Think of St.
 Matthew, for instance; he rose up at once,  forsook all, and followed Him.
"    "Yes," said Erica.
 "And what was the very first thing he was impelled to  do by way of 'following?' Why, to make a great feast and have in all his  old friends, all the despised publicans.
"    "My dear Erica," said Mr. Fane-Smith, feeling his theological arguments  worsted, "we must discuss this matter on practical grounds.
 In plain  words, your father is a very bad man, and you ought to have nothing more  to do with him.
"    Erica's lips turned white with anger; but she answered, calmly:    "That is a very great accusation.
 How do you know it is true?"    "I know it well enough," said Mr. Fane-Smith.
 "Why, every one in England  knows it.
"    "If you accept mere hearsay evidence, you may believe anything of any  one.
 Have you ever read any of my father's books?"    "No.
"    "Or heard him lecture?"    "No, indeed; I would not hear him on any account.
"    "Have you ever spoken with any of his intimate friends?"    "Mr. Raeburn's acquaintances are not likely to mix with any one I should  know.
"    "Then," cried Erica, "how can you know anything whatever about him? And  how how DARE you say to me, his child, that he is a wicked man?"    "It is a matter of common notoriety.
"    "No," said Erica, "there you are wrong.
 It is notorious that my father  teaches conscientiously teaches much that we regard as error, but people  who openly accuse him of evil living find to their cost in the law  courts that they have foully libeled him.
"    She flushed even now at the thought of some of the hateful and wicked  accusations of the past.
 Then, after a moment's pause, she continued  more warmly:    "It is you people in society who get hold of some misquoted story, some  ridiculous libel long ago crushed at the cost of the libeler it is you  who do untold mischief! Only last summer I remember seeing in a paper  the truest sentence that was ever written of my father, and it was this,  'Probably no one man has ever had to endure such gross personal insults,  such widespread hostility, such perpetual calumny.
' Why are you to judge  him? Even if you had a special call to it, how could you justly judge  him when you will not hear him, or know him, or fairly study his  writings, or question his friends? How can you know anything whatever  about him? Why, if he judged you and your party as you judge him, you  would be furious!"    "My dear, you speak with so much warmth; if you would only discuss  things calmly!" said Mr. Fane-Smith.
 "Remember what George Herbert  says: 'Calmness is a great advantage.
' You bring too much feeling to the  discussion.
"    "How can I help feeling when you are slandering my father?" exclaimed  Erica.
 "I have tried to be calm, but there are limits to endurance!  Would you like Rose to sit silently while my father told her without any  ground that you were a wicked man?"    When matters were reversed in this crude way, Mr. Fane-Smith winced a  little.
    "The cases are different," he suggested.
    "Do you think atheists don't love their children as much as Christians?"  cried Erica, half choked with indignant anger.
 A vision of the past,  of her dead mother, of her father's never-failing tenderness brought  a cloud of tears to her eyes.
 She brushed them away.
 "The cases are  different, as you say; but does a man care less for his home, when  outside it he is badgered and insulted, or does he care infinitely more?  Does a man care less for his child because, to get her food, he has had  to go short himself, or does he care more? I think the man who has had  to toil with all his might for his family loves it better than the rich  man can.
 You say I speak with too much warmth, too much feeling.
 My  complaint is the other way I can't find words strong enough to give you  any idea of what my father has always been to me.
 To leave him would be  to wrong my conscience, and to forsake my duty; and to distrust God.
 I  will NEVER leave him!"    With that she got up and left the room, and Mr. Fane-Smith leaned back  in his chair with a sigh, his eyes fixed absently upon a portrait of  Napoleon above his mantel piece, his mind more completely shaken out of  its ordinary grooves than it had been for years.
 He was a narrow-minded  man, but he was honest.
 He saw that he had judged Raeburn very unfairly.
  But perhaps what occupied his thoughts the most was the question  "Would Rose have been able to say of him all that Erica had said of her  father?" He sighed many times, but after awhile slid back into the old  habits of thought.
    "Erica is a brave, noble, little thing," he said to himself, "but far  from orthodox far from orthodox! Socinian tendencies.
"        .
 At Oak Dene Manor         Ah!  To how many faith has been       No evidence of things unseen,       But a dim shadow that recasts the creed of the Phantasiasts.

         Tales of a Wayside Inn.
  Longfellow    During the interview Erica had braced herself up to endure, but when  it was over her strength all at once evaporated.
 She dragged herself  upstairs somehow, and had just reached her room, when Mrs. Fane-Smith  met her.
 She was preoccupied with her own anxieties, or Erica's  exhaustion could not have escaped her notice.
    "I am really quite unhappy about Rose!" she exclaimed.
 "We must send  for Doctor L----.
 Her cough seems so much worse, I fear it will turn to  bronchitis.
 Are you learned in such things?"    "I helped to nurse Tom through a bad attack once," said Erica.
    "Oh! Then come and see her," said Mrs. Fane-Smith.
    Erica went without a word.
 She would not have liked Mrs. Fane-Smith's  fussing, but yet the sight of her care for Rose made her feel more  achingly conscious of the blank in her own life that blank which nothing  could ever fill.
 She wanted her own mother so terribly, and just now  Mrs. Fane-Smith had touched the old wound roughly.
    Rose seemed remarkably cheerful, and not nearly so much invalided as her  mother thought.
    "Mamma always thinks I am going to die if I'm at all out of sorts," she  remarked, when Mrs. Fane-Smith had left the room to write to the doctor.
  "I believe you want doctoring much more than I do.
 What is the matter?  You are as white as a sheet!"    "I am tired and rather worried, and my back is troublesome," said Erica.
    "Then you'll just lie down on my sofa," said Rose, peremptorily.
 "If you  don't, I shall get out of bed and make you.
"    Erica did not require much compulsion for every inch of her seemed to  have a separate ache, and she was still all quivering and tingling with  the indignant anger stirred up by her interview with Mr. Fane-Smith.
 She  let Rose chatter away and tried hard to school herself into calmness.
  By and by her efforts were rewarded; she not only grew calm, but fell  asleep, and slept like any baby till the gong sounded for luncheon.
    Luncheon proved a very silent meal; it was, if possible, more trying  that breakfast had been.
 Mrs. Fane-Smith had heard all about the  interview from her husband, and they were both perplexed and disturbed.
  Erica felt uncertain of her footing with them, and could only wait for  them to make the first move.
 But the grim silence tickled her fancy.
    "Really," she thought to herself, "we might be so many horses munching  away at mangers, for all we have said to each other.
"    But in spite of it she did not feel inclined to make conversation.
    Later on she went for a drive with her aunt; the air revived her,  and she began to feel more like herself again.
 They went out into the  country, but on the way home Mrs. Fane-Smith stopped at one of the shops  in High Street, leaving Erica in the carriage.
 She was leaning back  restfully, watching a beautiful chestnut horse which was being held by a  ragged boy at the door of the bank just opposite, when her attention was  suddenly aroused by an ominous howling and barking.
 The chestnut horse  began to kick, and the boy had as much as he could to hold him.
 Starting  forward, Erica saw that a fox terrier had been set upon by another and  larger dog, and that the two were having a desperate fight.
 The fox  terrier was evidently fighting against fearful odds, for he was an old  dog, and not nearly so strong as his antagonist; the howls and barks  grew worse and worse; some of the passengers ran off in a fright, others  watched from a safe distance, but not one interfered.
    Now Erica was a great lover of animals, and a passionate lover of  justice.
 Furious to see men and boys looking on without attempting to  stop the mischief, she sprang out of the carriage, and, rushing up to  the combatants, belabored the big dog with her parasol.
 It had a strong  stick, but she hit so vehemently that it splintered all to bits, and  still the dog would not leave its victim.
 Then, in her desperation, she  hit on the right remedy; with great difficulty she managed to grasp him  by the throat, and, using all her force, so nearly suffocated him that  he was obliged to loosen his hold.
 At that moment, too, a strong man  rushed forward and dealt him such a blow that he bounded off with a  yell of pain, and ran howling down the street.
 Erica bent over the fox  terrier then; the big dog had mangled it frightfully, it was covered  with blood, and moaned piteously.
    "Waif! My poor waif!" exclaimed a voice which she seemed to know.
 "Has  that brute killed you?"    She looked up and saw Donovan Farrant; he recognized her, but they  were both too much absorbed in the poor dog's condition to think of any  ordinary greeting.
    "Where will you take him?" asked Erica.
    Donovan stooped down to examine poor Waif's injuries.
    "I fear there is little to be done," he said.
 "But we might take him  across to the chemist's opposite.
 Will you hold my whip for me?"    She took it, and with infinite skill and tenderness Donovan lifted the  fox terrier, while Erica hurried on in front to tell the chemist.
 They  took Waif into a little back room, and did all they could for him; but  the chemist shrugged his shoulders.
    "Better kill the poor brute at once, Mr. Farrant," he said, blandly.
    Donovan looked up with a strange gleam in his eyes.
    "Not for the world!" he exclaimed, with a touch of indignation in his  tone.
    And after that he only spoke to Erica, who, seeing that the chemist  had annoyed him undertook all the fetching and carrying, never once  shrinking though the sight was a horrible one.
 At length the footman  brought word that Mrs. Fane-Smith was waiting, and she was obliged to  go, reluctantly enough.
    "You'll let me know how he gets on?" she said.
    "Yes, indeed," he replied, not thanking her directly for her help, but  somehow sending her away with the consciousness that they had passed the  bounds of mere acquaintanceship, and were friends for life.
    She found that her aunt had been waylaid by Mr. Cuthbert.
    "If I were the owner of the dog, I should have up our honorable member  for assault.
 I believe Miss Raeburn broke her umbrella over the poor  thing.
"    Erica was just in time to hear this.
    "Were you watching it?" she exclaimed.
 "And you did nothing to help the  fox terrier?"    "I do not feel bound to champion every fighting cur who is getting  the worst of it," said Mr. Cuthbert.
 "What has become of Mr. Farrant's  favorite? I suppose he is fussing over it instead of studying the  affairs of the nation.
"    "I am afraid the dog is dying," said Erica.
    A curious change passed over Mr. Cuthbert's face; he looked a little  shocked, and turned away somewhat hastily.
    "Come," thought Erica to herself, "I am glad to have discovered a grain  of good in you.
"    The next day was Sunday; it passed by very quietly.
 But on the Monday,  when Erica opened the "Daily Review," there was her "Society" article  staring her in the face.
 It was clever and eminently readable, but it  was bitterly sarcastic; she could not endure it.
 It seemed to her that  she had written what was positively bad, calculated to mislead and to  awaken bitterness, not in the least likely to mend matters.
 The fact was  she had written it in a moment of passion and against her conscience,  and she regretted it now with far more compunction than she felt for  anything she had written in former times in the "Idol-Breaker.
" Then,  though indirectly and sometimes directly attacking Christianity, she had  written conscientiously, now for the first time she felt that she had  dishonored her pen.
 She went down into the very deepest depths.
    The midday post brought her a letter from her stiff old editor, who  understood her better, and thought more of her than she dreamed.
 It  informed her that another member of the staff had returned from his  holiday, and if she pleased she could be exempted from writing for a  fortnight.
 As usual Mr. Bircham "begged to remain hers faithfully.
"    She hardly knew whether to regard this as a relief or as a punishment.
  With a sigh she opened a second letter; it was from Charles Osmond,  in reply to a despairing note which she had sent off just before her  Saturday interview with Mr. Fane-Smith.
    It was one of his short, characteristic letters.
    "Dear Erica, 'It all comes in the day's work,' as the man said when the  lion ate him! You should have a letter, but I'm up to the eyes in  parish maters.
 All I can say is pray for that charity which covers the  multitude of sins, and then I think you'll find the Greyshot folk become  more bearable.
 So you have met Donovan at last.
 I am right glad! Your  father and I had a long walk together yesterday; he seems very well.
  Yours ever, C.
 O.
"    This made her smile, and she opened a third letter which ran as follows:    "My dear Miss Raeburn, I should have called on you last Saturday, but  was not well enough to come in to Greyshot.
 My husband told me all about  your help and your kindness to our Waif.
 I know you will be glad to hear  that he is going on well; he is much more to us all than an ordinary  favorite, some day you shall hear his story.
 I am writing now to ask,  sans ceremonie, if you will come and spend a few days with us.
 It will  be a great pleasure to us if you will say yes.
 My husband will be in  Greyshot on Monday afternoon, and will call for your answer; please come  if you can.
 Yours very sincerely, Gladys Farrant.
"    Erica showed this letter to her aunt, and of course there was nothing to  prevent her going; indeed, Mrs. Fane-Smith was really rather relieved,  for she thought a few days' absence might make things more comfortable  for Erica, and, besides, Rose's illness made the days dull for her.
    It was about four o'clock when Donovan Farrant arrived.
 Erica felt as  though she were meeting an old friend when she went into the drawing  room, and found him standing on the hearth rug.
    "You have had my wife's note?" he asked, taking her hand.
    "Yes," she replied.
    "And you will come?"    "If you will have me.
"    "That's right; we had set our hearts on it.
 You are looking very tired.
  I hope Saturday did not upset you?"    "No," said Erica.
 "But there have been a good many worries, and I have  not yet learned the art of taking life quietly.
"    "You are overdone, you want a rest," said Donovan, whose keen and  practiced observation had at once noticed her delicate physique and  peculiar temperament.
 "You are a poet, you see, and as a wise man once  remarked: 'The poetic temperament is one of singular irritability of  nerve.
'"    Erica laughed.
    "I am no poet!"    "Not a writer of verses, but a poet in the sense of a maker, an artist.
  As a reader of the 'Daily Review,' you must allow me to judge.
 Brian  once showed me one of your articles, and I always recognize them now by  the style.
"    "I don't deserve the name of artist one bit," said Erica, coloring.
 "I  would give all I have to destroy my article of today.
 You have not seen  that, or you would not have given me such a name.
    "Yes, I have seen it; I read it this morning at breakfast, and made  up my mind that you wrote it on Friday evening, after Lady Caroline's  dinner.
 I can understand that you hate the thing now.
 One gets a sharp  lesson every now and then, and it lasts one a life time.
"    Erica signed.
.
 He resumed.
    "Well! Are you coming to Oakdene with me?"    "Did you mean now at once today?"    "If you will.
"    "Oh, I should so like to!" she cried.
 "But will Mrs. Farrant be  expecting me?"    "She will be hoping for you, and that is better.
"    Erica was noted for the speed with which she could pack a portmanteau,  and it could not have been more than ten minutes before she was ready.
  Mrs. Fane-Smith wished her goodbye with a sort of affectionate relief;  then Donovan helped her into the pony carriage, and drove briskly off  through the Greyshot streets.
    "That is the place where I first heard your father," he said, indicating  with his whip the town Hall.
 "It must be sixteen years ago; I was quite  a young fellow.
"    "Sixteen years! Did you hear him so long ago as that?" said Erica,  thoughtfully.
 "Why, that must have been about the time of the great  Stockborough trial.
"    "It was; I remember reference being made to it, and how it stirred me  up to think of Mr. Raeburn's gallant defense of freedom, and all that it  was costing him.
 How well I remember, too, riding home that night along  this very road, with the thoughts of the good of the race, the love of  humanity, touched into life for the first time.
 When a selfish cynic  first catches a glimpse of an honest man toiling for what he believes  the good of humanity, it is a wonderful moment for him! Mr. Raeburn was  about the only man living that I believed in.
 You can understand that I  owe him an immense debt of gratitude.
"    "That is what you referred to in the House last year!" said Erica.
 "How  curiously lives are linked together! Words spoken by my father years ago  set thoughts working in you you make a speech and refer to them.
 I read  a report of your speech in a time of chaotic wretchedness, and it comes  like an answer to a prayer!"    "Another bond between us," said Donovan.
    After that they were silent; they had left the high road and were  driving along winding country lanes, catching glimpses every now and  then of golden corn fields still unreaped, or of fields just beginning  to be dotted with sheaves, where the men were at work.
 It was a late  harvest that year, but a good one.
 Presently they passed the tiny little  village church which nestled under the brow of the hill, and then came a  steep ascent, which made Donovan spring out of the pony chaise.
 Erica's  words had awakened a long train of thought, had carried him back to the  far past, and had brought him fresh proof of that wonderful unity of  Nature which, though often little dreamed of, binds man to man.
 He gave  the ponies a rest half way up the hill, and, stretching up into the high  hedge, gathered a beautiful spray of red-berried briony for Erica.
    "Do you remember that grand thought which Shakespeare puts into the  mouth of Henry V.
"        "'There is some soul of goodness in things evil.
'       'Tis wonderful to look back in life and trace it out.
"    He spoke rather abruptly, but Erica's thoughts had been following much  the same bent, and she understood him.
    "Trust is easy on such a day as this and in such a place," she said,  looking down to the beautiful valley and up to the green, encircling  hills.
    Donovan smiled, and touched up the ponies.
    It seemed to Erica that they had turned their backs on bigotry, and  annoyance, and care of every description, and were driving right into  a land of rest.
 Presently they turned in at some iron gates, and drove  down a long approach, bordered with fir trees.
 At the end of this stood  the manor, a solid, comfortable, well-built country house, its rather  plain exterior veiled with ivy and creepers.
 Donovan led her into the  hall, where stately old high-backed chairs and a suit or two of  old armor were intermixed with modern appliances, fishing tackle, a  lawn-tennis box, and a sprinkling of toys, which indicated that there  were children in the house.
    This fact was speedily indicated in another way, for there came a rush  and a scamper overhead, and a boy of five or six years old ran down the  broad oak staircase.
    "Oh, father! May I ride round to the stables on Speedwell?" he cried,  in a desperate hurry to attract his father's attention away from the  servant and the portmanteau; then, catching sight of Erica, he checked  himself, and held out his hand with a sort of shy courtesy.
 He was  exactly what Donovan must have been as a child, as far as looks went.
    "To the stables, Ralph?" replied his father, looking round.
 "Yes, if you  like.
 Put on your hat though.
 Where's your mother?"    "In the garden with Mr. Cunningham; he came a few minutes ago; and he's  got such a horse, father! A real beauty just like cocoa.
"    "A roan," said Donovan, laughing; then, as Ralph disappeared through the  open door, he turned to the servant.
    "Is it Mr. Cunningham of Blachingbury?"    "No, sir; Mr. Leslie Cunningham.
"    Erica listened, not without interest, for she knew that Leslie  Cunningham was the recently elected member for East Mountshire, the  eldest son of Sir Michael Cunningham.
    "We must come and find them," said Donovan; and together they went out  into the garden.
    Here, on one of the broad, grassy terraces, under the shade of a  copper-beech, was afternoon tea on a wicker table.
 Gladys was talking to  Mr. Cunningham, but catching sight of her husband and Erica at the other  end of the terrace, she hurried forward to greet them.
    "This is delightful!" she exclaimed.
 "I hoped that Donovan might  unceremoniously carry you off today, but hardly dared to expect it.
 You  are just in time for tea.
"    "Your arrival has caused quite a sensation in the nursery," said Donovan  to Leslie Cunningham.
 "My small boy is in raptures over your horse 'just  like cocoa!'"    Leslie gave rather an absent laugh.
 He was watching Erica, who was still  at a little distance talking to Gladys.
    "May I be introduced to your guest?" he said.
    "Certainly," said Donovan.
 "She is the daughter of Mr. Raeburn.
"    Leslie started.
    "Indeed! I have heard about her from old Bircham, the editor.
 He can't  say enough of her.
"    Apparently Leslie Cunningham could not look enough at her.
    Donovan, thinking of Brian, was perhaps a little vexed at the meeting.
  However, putting himself into his guest's position, he felt that the  admiration was but natural, and as to Brian if he chose to lose his  heart to such a lovely girl, he must expect to have many rivals.
    Erica's first thought, as she glanced at Leslie Cunningham, was one  of disappointment.
 He was not the least like his father.
 However, by  degrees she began to like him--for his own sake.
 He could not have  been more than five-and-twenty, and looked even younger; for he was  fair-complexioned and clean-shaven.
 His thick, flaxen hair, and rather  pallid face were decidedly wanting in color, but were relieved by very  dark gray eyes.
 His features were well cut and regular, and the face was  altogether a clever as well as an attractive one.
    Erica felt as if she had got into a very delicious new word.
 The novelty  of a meal AL FRESCO, the lovely view, the beautifully laid out grounds  were charming externals; and then there were the deeper enjoyments  the lovability of her host and hostess; the delightful atmosphere of  broad-hearted sympathy in which they seemed to live and move, and, above  all, the restfulness, the freedom of not living in momentary expectation  of being rubbed the wrong way by a vexing conversation on religious,  or political, or personal topics.
 It was like a beautiful dream quite  unlike any part of real, waking existence that she had ever before  known.
 The conversation was bright and lively.
 They talked because they  had something to say, and wished to say it, and the artificial element  so prevalent in society talk was entirely absent.
    Presently Ralph came out of the house, leading a fairy-like little girl  of four years old.
    "Here come the children," said Gladys.
 "The hour before dinner is their  special time.
 You have not seen Dolly, have you?"    "Dolly!" The name awoke some recollection of the past in Erica, and, as  she kissed the little girl, she looked at her closely.
 Yes, it was the  same fascinating little baby face, with its soft, pink cheeks and little  pointed chin, its innocent, blue-gray eyes, its tiny, sweet-tempered  mouth.
 The sunny brown hair was longer and Dolly was an inch or two  taller, but she was undoubtedly the same.
    "Now I know why I always felt that I knew your face!" exclaimed Erica,  turning to Donovan.
 "Was not Dolly lost at Codrington last year?"    "On the beach," replied Donovan.
 "Yes! Why, could it have been you who  brought her back? Of course it was! Now it all comes back to me.
 I had  exactly the same feeling about knowing your face the other evening at  Lady Caroline's, but put it down to your likeness to Mr. Raeburn.
 There  is another bond between us.
"    They both laughed.
 Donovan took Dolly upon his knee.
    "Do you remember, Dolly, when you were lost on the beach once?"    "Yes," said Dolly, promptly, "I clied.
"    "Who found you?"    "Farver," said Dolly.
    "Who brought you to father?"    Dolly searched her memory.
    "An old gentleman gave Dolly sweets!"    "My father," said Erica, smiling.
    "And who helped you up the beach?" asked Gladys.
    "A plitty lady did," said Dolly.
    "Was it this lady, do you think?" said Donovan, indicating Erica.
    Dolly trotted round with her dear little laughing face to make the  scrutiny.
    "I fink vis one is plittier," she announced.
 Whereupon every one began  to laugh.
    "The most charming compliment I ever heard!" said Leslie Cunningham.
  "Dolly ought to be patted on the back.
"    Erica smiled and colored; but as she looked again at Donovan and little  Dolly, her thoughts wandered away to that June day in the museum when  they had been the parable which shadowed forth to her such a wonderful  reality.
 Truly, there were links innumerable between her and Donovan.
    Leslie Cunningham seemed as if he intended to stay forever; however,  every one was quite content to sit out on the lawn talking and watching  the children at their play.
 It was one of those still, soft September  evenings when one is glad of any excuse to keep out of doors.
    At last the dressing bell rang, and Leslie took out his watch with an  air of surprise.
    "The afternoon has flown!" he exclaimed.
 "I had no idea it was so late.
  I wanted to ask you, by the bye, whether I could see the coffee tavern  at Greyshot.
 We are going to start one down at our place, and I want to  see one or two well-managed ones first.
 Whereabouts is it? I think I'll  ride on now, and have a look at it.
"    "Dine with us first," said Donovan, "and I'll ride over with you between  eight and nine, that is the best time for seeing it in full swing.
"    So Leslie Cunningham stayed to dinner, and talked a great deal about  temperance work, but did not succeed in blinding his host, who knew well  enough that Erica had been the real cause of his desire to go over to  Greyshot.
    Temperance, however, proved a fortunate subject, for it was, of course,  one in which she was deeply interested, all the more so now that it  formed one of the strongest bonds remaining between herself and her  father's followers.
 A large number of the Raeburnites were either  teetotalers or very strong temperance advocates, and Erica, who was  constantly out and about in the poorer parts of London, had realized  forcibly the terrible national evil, and was an enthusiastic temperance  worker.
    Donovan, perhaps out of malice prepense, administered a good many dry  details about the management of coffee taverns, personal supervision,  Etzenberger's machines, the necessity of a good site and attractive  building, etc.
, etc.
 Erica only wished that Tom could have been  there, he would have been so thoroughly in his element.
 By and by the  conversation drifted away to other matters.
 And as Leslie Cunningham was  a good and very amusing talker, and Gladys the perfection of a hostess,  the dinner proved very lively, an extraordinary contrast to the dreary,  vapid table talk to which Erica had lately been accustomed.
 After the  ladies had left the room, Donovan, rather to his amusement, found  the talk veering round to Luke Raeburn.
 Presently, Leslie Cunningham  hazarded a direct question about Erica in a would-be indifferent tone.
  In reply, Donovan told him briefly and without comment what he knew of  her history, keeping on the surface of things and speaking always with a  sort of careful restraint.
 He was never very fond of discussing people,  and perhaps in this case the realization of the thousand objections  to any serious outcome of Leslie's sudden admiration strengthened his  reserve.
 However, fate was apparently kinder though perhaps really  more cruel than the host, for Donovan was summoned into the library to  interview an aggrieved constituent, and Leslie finding his way to the  drawing room, was only too delighted to meet Gladys going upstairs to  see her children.
    The lamps were lighted in the drawing room, but the curtains were not  drawn, and beside the open window he saw a slim, white-robed figure.
  Erica was looking out into the gathering darkness.
 He crossed the room,  and stood beside her, his heart beating quickly, all the more  because she did not move or take any notice of his presence.
 It was  unconventional, but perhaps because he was so weary of the ordinary  young ladies who invariably smiled and fluttered the moment he  approached them, and were so perfectly ready to make much of him, this  unconventionality attracted him.
 He watched her for a minute in silence.
  She was very happy, and was looking her loveliest.
 Presently she turned.
    "I think it is the stillness which is so wonderful!" she exclaimed.
    It was spoken with the frankness of a child, with the spontaneous  confidence of the pure child-nature, which instinctively recognizes all  the lovable and trustable.
 The clear, golden eyes looked right into his  for a moment.
 A strange reverence awoke within him.
 He had seen more  beautiful eyes before, but none so entirely wanting in that unreality of  expression arising from a wish to produce an effect, none so beautifully  sincere.
    "The country stillness, you mean?" he replied.
    "Yes; it is rest in itself.
 I have never stayed in the country before.
"    "Is it possible!" he exclaimed.
    He had often languidly discussed the comparative advantages of Murren  and Zermatt with girls who took a yearly tour abroad as naturally as  their dinner, but to talk to one who had spent her whole life in towns,  who could enjoy a country evening so absolutely and unaffectedly, was a  strange and delightful novelty.
    "You are one of those who can really enjoy," he said.
 "You are not  blasee you are one of the happy mortals who keep the faculty of  enjoyment as strongly all through life as in childhood.
"    "Yes, I think I can enjoy," said Erica.
 "But I suppose we pay for our  extra faculty of enjoyment.
    "You mean by being more sensitive to pain?"    "Yes, though that sounds rather like Dickens's Mrs. Gummidge, when she  thought she felt smoky chimneys more than other people.
"    He laughed.
    "How I wish you could turn over your work to me, and go to Switzerland  tomorrow in my place! Only I should wish to be there, too, for the sake  of seeing you enjoy it.
"    "Do you go tomorrow?"    "Yes, with my father.
"    "Ah! How delightful! I confess I do envy you a little.
 I do long to see  snow mountains.
 Always living in London makes me--"    He interrupted her with a sort of exclamation of horror.
    "Oh! Don't abuse London!" she said, laughing.
 "If one must live all the  year round in one place, I would rather be there than anywhere.
 When I  hear people abusing it, I always think they don't know how to use  their eyes.
 What can be more lovely, for instance, than the view from  Greenwich Park by the observatory? Don't you know that beautiful clump  of Scotch firs in the foreground, and then the glimpse of the river  through the trees? And then there is that lovely part by Queen  Elizabeth's oak.
 The view in Hyde Park, too, over the Serpentine, how  exquisite that is on a summer afternoon, with the Westminster towers  standing up in a golden haze.
 Or Kensington Gardens in the autumn, when  the leaves are turning, and there is blue mist in the background against  the dark tree trunks.
 I think I love every inch of London!"    Leslie Cunningham would have listened to the praises of the Black  Country, if only for the sake of hearing her voice.
    "Well, as far as England goes, you are in the right place for scenery  now; I know a few lovelier parts than this.
"    "What are those lights on the lower terrace?" asked Erica, suddenly.
    "Glow worms.
 Have you never seen them? Come and look at them nearer.
"    "Oh, I should like to!" she said, with the charming enthusiasm and  eagerness which delighted him so much.
    To guide her down the steps in the dusky garden, to feel her hand on his  arm, to hear her fresh, naive remarks, and then to recall what Donovan  Farrant had just told him about her strange, sad story, all seemed to  draw him on irresistibly.
 He had had three or four tolerably serious  flirtations, but now he knew that he had never before really loved.
    Erica was delighted with the glow worms, and delighted with the dewy  fragrance of the garden, and delighted with the soft, balmy stillness  of the night.
 She was one of those who revel in Nature, and all that  she said was evidently the overflow of a rapturous happiness, curiously  contrasting with the ordinary set remarks of admiration, or falsely  sentimental outbursts too much in vogue.
 But Leslie Cunningham found  that the child-likeness was not only in manner, but that Erica had no  idea of flirting; she was bright, and merry, and talkative, but she had  no thought, no desire of attracting his attention.
 She had actually  and literally come out into the garden to see the glow worms, not to  monopolize the much-run-after young M.
P, and as soon as she had seen  them she said she felt cold, and suggested going back again.
    He was disappointed, but the words were so perfectly sincere, so free  from suspicion of mere conventionality, that there was nothing for it  but to return.
 Half amused, half piqued, but wholly in love, he speedily  forgot himself in real anxiety.
    "I hope you haven't taken cold," he said, with great solicitude.
    "Oh, no," said Erica; "but I want to be careful for the night-school  work will be beginning soon, and I must go home fresh for that.
"    Something in her words broke the spell of perfect happiness which had  hitherto held him.
 Was it the mention of her every-day life, with its  surroundings unknown to him? Or was it some faint perception that in  the world of duty to which she referred their paths could not rightly  converge? A cold chill crept over him.
    "You were quite right," he said with an involuntary shiver.
 "It is  decidedly cold out here; the mist rises from the river, I expect,  or else your reference to the working-day world has recalled me from  fairy-land.
 You should not speak of work in such a place as this it is  incongruous.
"    She smiled.
    "Ernst ist das leben," she replied quietly.
 "One can't forget that even  at such a time as this, and in such a place.
"    "How is it that some never forget that for a moment, while others never  remember it at all?" he said musingly.
    "Some of us have no excuse for ever forgetting," she answered "hardly a  chance either.
"    And though the words were vague, they shadowed out to him much of her  life a life never free from sorrow, burdened with constant care and  anxiety, and ever confronted by some of the most perplexing world  problems.
 A longing to shield, and protect, and comfort her rose in his  heart, yet all the time he instinctively knew that hers was the stronger  nature.
    It seemed that the seriousness of life was to be borne in upon them  specially that evening, for, returning to the drawing room, they found  Donovan released from his interview, and relating with some indignation  the pitiable story he had just heard.
 It only reached Leslie Cunningham  in fragments, however over crowding, children sleeping six in a bed,  two of them with scarlet fever, no fever hospital, no accommodation for  them, an inspector, medical officer, the board how drearily dry all the  details seemed to him.
 He could do nothing but watch Erica's eager face  with its ever-varying play of expression.
 He hardly knew whether to be  angry with Donovan Farrant for alluding to matters which brought a look  of sadness to her eyes, or to thank him for the story which made her  face light up with indignation and look, if possible, more beautiful  than before.
    "Don't offer to put up a fever shanty on the lawn," said Gladys when her  husband paused.
    "I wish we had an empty cottage where we could put them" said Donovan;  "but I am afraid all I can do is to bring pressure to bear upon the  authorities.
 We'll ride over together, Cunningham, and Jack Trevethan,  our manager, shall show you the tavern while I rout out this medical  officer.
"    They had had tea; there was no longer any excuse for delaying.
 Leslie,  with an outward smile and an inward sigh, turned to take leave of Erica.
  She was bending over a basket in which was curled up the invalid fox  terrier.
 For a moment she left off stroking the white and tan head, and  held out her hand.
    "Goodbye," she said frankly.
    That was all.
 And yet it made Leslie's heart bound.
 Was he indeed to go  to Switzerland tomorrow? He MUST manage to get out of it somehow.
    And all the way to Greyshot he listened to schemes for the work to be  done next session from the ardent sanitary reformer, though just then  the devastation of all England would scarcely have roused him so long as  he was assured of the safety of Luke Raeburn's daughter.
        .
 The Happiest of Weeks         He went in the strength of dependence       To tread where his Master trod,       To gather and knit together The Family of God.
         With a conscience freed from burdens,       And a heart set free from care,       To minister to every one       Always and everywhere.
       Author of Chronicles of the Schonberg Cotta Family    After this came a happy, uneventful week at the manor.
 Erica often  thought of the definition of happiness which Charles Osmond had once  given her "Perfect harmony with your surroundings.
" She had never been  so happy in her life.
 Waif, who was slowly recovering, grew pathetically  fond of his rescuer.
 The children were devoted to her, and she to them.
  She learned to love Gladys very much, and from her she learned a good  deal which helped her to understand Donovan's past life.
 Then, too, it  was the first time in her life that she had ever been in a house where  there were little children, and probably Ralph and Dolly did more for  her than countless sermons or whole libraries of theology could have  done.
    Above all, there was Donovan, and the friendship of such a man was a  thing which made life a sort of wordless thanksgiving.
 At times even  in those she loved best, even in her father or Charles Osmond, she was  conscious of something which jarred a little, but so perfect was her  sympathy with Donovan, so closely and strangely were their lives and  characters linked together, that never once was the restfulness of  perfect harmony broken Nature and circumstances had, as it were  turned them to each other.
 He could understand, as no one else could  understand, the reversal of thought and feeling which she had passed  through during the last few months.
    He could understand the perplexities of her present position, suddenly  confronted with the world of wealth and fashion and conventional  religion, and fresh from a circle where, whatever the errors held  and promulgated, the life was so desperately earnest, often so nobly  self-denying.
 He knew that Mr. Fane-Smith, good man as he was, must have  been about the severest of trials to a new-born faith.
 He understood how  Mr. Cuthbert's malice would tend to reawaken the harsh class judgment  against which, as a Christian, Erica was bound to struggle.
 He could  fully realize the irritated, ruffled state she was in she was overdone,  and wanted perfect rest and quiet, perfect love and sympathy.
 He and  his wife gave her all these, took her not only to their house, but right  into their home, and how to do this no one knew so well as Donovan,  perhaps because he had once been in much the same position himself.
 It  was his most leisure month, the time he always devoted to home and wife  and children, so that Erica saw a great deal of him.
 He seemed to her  the ideal head of an ideal yet real home.
 It was one of those homes and  thank God there are such! where belief in the Unseen reacts upon the  life in the seen, making it so beautiful, so lovable, that, when you go  out once more into the ordinary world you go with a widened heart, and  the realization that the kingdom of Heaven of which Christ spoke does  indeed begin upon earth.
    It is strange, in tracing the growth of spontaneous love, to notice how  independent it is of time.
 Love annihilates time with love, as with  God, time is not.
 Like the miracles, it brings into use the aeonial  measurement in which "one day is a thousand years, and a thousand years  is one day.
" A week, even a few hours, may give us love and knowledge  and mutual sympathy with one which the intercourse of many years fails  to give with another.
    The week at Oakdene was one which all her life long Erica looked back  to with the loving remembrance which can gild and beautify the most  sorrowful of lives.
 It is surely a mistake to think that the memory  of past delights makes present pain sharper.
 If not, why do we all  so universally strive to make the lives of children happy? Is it not  because we know that happiness in the present will give a sort of  reflected happiness even in the saddest future? Is it not because we  know how in life's bitterest moments, its most barren and desolate  paths, we feel a warmth about our heart, a smile upon our lips, when  we remember the old home days with their eager childish interests and  hopes, their vividly recollected pleasures, their sheltered luxuriance  of fatherly and motherly love? For how many thousands did the poet speak  when he wrote         "The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual       benediction.
"    A benediction which outlives the cares and troubles of later life which  we may carry with us to our dying day, and find perfected indeed in that  Unseen, where         "All we have willed, or hoped, or dreamed of good shall       exist, Not its semblance, but itself.
"    There was only one bit of annoyance during the whole time; it was on the  Sunday, the day before Erica was to go back to Greyshot.
 Gladys was not  very well and stayed at home, but Donovan and Erica went to church with  the children, starting rather early that they might enjoy the lovely  autumn morning, and also that they might put the weekly wreaths on two  graves in the little church yard.
 Donovan himself put the flowers upon  the first, Ralph and Dolly talking softly together about "little  Auntie Dot," then running off hand in hand to make the "captain's glave  plitty," as Dolly expressed it.
 Erica, following them, glanced at the  plain white headstone and read the name: "John Frewin, sometimes captain  of the 'Metora.
'"    Then they went together into the little country church, and all at once  a shadow fell on her heart; for, as they entered at the west end, the  clergy and the choristers entered the chancel, and she saw that Mr.  Cuthbert was to take the service.
 The rector was taking his holiday, and  had enlisted help from Greyshot.
    Happily no man has it in his power to mar the Church of England service,  but by and by came the sermon.
 Now Mr. Cuthbert cordially detested  Donovan; he made no secret of it.
 He opposed and thwarted him on every  possible occasion, and it is to be feared that personal malice had  something to do with his choice of a subject for that morning's sermon.
    He had brought over to Oakdene a discourse on the eternity of  punishment.
 Perhaps he honestly believed that people could be frightened  to heaven, at any rate he preached a most ghastly sermon, and, what  was worse, preached it with vindictive energy.
 The poor, mangled,  much-distorted text about the tree lying as it falls was brought to the  fore once again, and, instead of bearing reference to universal charity  and almsgiving as it was intended to do, was ruthlessly torn from its  context and turned into a parable about the state of the soul at death.
  The words "damned" and "damnation," with all their falsely theologized  significance, rang through the little church and made people shudder,  though all the time the speaker knew well enough that there were no such  words in the New Testament.
 Had he been there himself to see he could  not have described his material hell more graphically.
 Presently,  leaning right over the pulpit, his eyes fixed on the manor pew just  beneath him, he asked in thundering tones "My brethren, have you ever  realized what the word LOST means?" Then came a long catalogue of those  who in Mr. Cuthbert's opinion would undoubtedly be "lost," in which of  course all Erica's friends and relatives were unhesitatingly placed.
    Now to hear what we sincerely believe to be error crammed down the  throats of a congregation is at all times a great trial; but, when our  nearest and dearest are remorselessly thrust down to the nethermost  hell, impatience is apt to turn to wrath.
 Erica thought of her gentle,  loving, unselfish mother, and though nothing could alter her conviction  that long ere now she had learned the truths hidden from her in life,  yet she could not listen to Mr. Cuthbert's horrible words without  indignant emotion.
 A movement from Donovan recalled her.
 Little Dorothy  was on his knees fast asleep; he quietly reached out his hand, took up  Erica's prayer book which was nearest to him, and wrote a few words on  the fly leaf, handling the book to her.
 She read them.
 "Definition of  LOST: not found yet.
" Then the anger and grief and pain died away, and,  though the preacher still thundered overhead, God's truth stole into  Erica's heart once more by means of one of his earliest consecrated  preachers a little child.
 Once more Dolly and her father were to her a  parable; and presently, glancing away through the sunny south window,  her eye fell upon a small marble tablet just below it that she had not  before noticed, and this furnished her with thoughts which outlasted the  sermon.
    At the top was a medallion, the profile of the same fine, soldierly  looking man whose portrait hung in Donovan's study, and which was  so wonderfully like both himself and little Ralph.
 Beneath was the  following inscription:         "In loving Memory of RALPH FARRANT,       Who died at Porthkerran, Cornwall,       May 3, 18--, Aged 45         Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and       cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no       variableness, neither shadow of turning.
"    The date was sixteen years back, but the tablet was comparatively new,  and could not have been up more than six years at the outside.
 Erica was  able partly to understand why Donovan had chosen for it that particular  text, and nothing could more effectually have counteracted Mr.  Cuthbert's sermon than the thoughts which it awoke in her.
    Nevertheless, she did not quite get over the ruffled feeling, which was  now in a great measure physical, and it was with a sense of relief that  she found herself again in the open air, in the warmth, and sunshine,  and gladness of the September day.
 Donovan did not say a word.
 They  passed through the little church yard, and walked slowly up the  winding lane; the children, who had stopped to gather a fine cluster  of blackberries, were close behind them.
 In the silence, every word of  their talk could be distinctly heard.
    "I don't like God!" exclaimed Ralph, abruptly.
    "Oh, you naughty!" exclaimed Dolly, much shocked.
    "No, it isn't naughty.
 I don't think He's good.
 Why, do you think father  would let us be shut up in a horrid place for always and always? Course  he wouldn't.
 I 'spects if we'd got to go, he'd come, too.
"    Donovan and Erica looked at each other.
 Donovan turned round, and held  out his hand, at which both children rushed.
    "Ralph," he said, "if any one told you that I might some day leave off  loving you, leave off being your father what would you do?"    "I'd knock them down!" said Ralph, clinching his small fist.
    Donovan laughed a little, but did not then attempt to prove the  questionable wisdom of such a proceeding.
    "Why would you feel inclined to knock them down?" he asked.
    "Because it would be a wicked lie!" cried Ralph.
 "Because I know you  never could, father.
"    "You are quite right.
 Of course I never could.
 You would never believe  any one who told you that I could, because you would know it was  impossible.
 But just now you believed what some one said about God,  though you wouldn't have believed it of me.
 Never believe anything which  contradicts 'Our Father.
' It will be our father punishing us now and  hereafter, and you may be sure that He will do the best possible for all  His children.
 You are quite sure that I should only punish you to do you  good, and how much more sure may you be that God, who loves you so much  more, will do the same, and will never give you up.
"    Ralph looked hard at his bunch of blackberries, and was silent.
  Many thoughts were working in his childish brain.
 Presently he said,  meditatively:    "He did shout it out so loud and horrid! I s'pose he had forgotten about  'Our Father.
' But, you see, Dolly, it was all a mistake.
 Come along,  let's race down the drive.
"    Off they ran.
 Erica fancied that Donovan watched them rather sadly.
    "I thought Ralph was listening in church," she said.
 "Fancy a child of  his age thinking it all out like that!"    "Children think much more than people imagine," said Donovan.
 "And a  child invariably carries out a doctrine to its logical conclusion.
 'Tis  wonderful the fine sense of justice which you always find in them!"    "Ralph inherits that from you, I should think.
 How exactly like you he  is, especially when he is puzzling out some question in his own mind.
"    A strange shadow passed over Donovan's face.
 He was silent for a moment.
    "'Tis hard to be brave for one's own child," he said at last.
 "I confess  that the thought that Ralph may have to live through what I have lived  through is almost unendurable to me.
"    "How vexed you must have been that he heard today's sermon," said Erica.
    "Not now," he replied.
 "He has heard and taken in the other side, and  has instinctively recognized the truth.
 If I had had some one to say as  much to me when I was his age, it might have saved me twenty years of  atheism.
"    "It is not only children who are repulsed by this," said Erica.
 "Or  learned men like James Mill.
 I know well enough that hundreds of my  father's followers were driven away from Christianity merely by having  this view constantly put before them.
 How were they to know that half  the words about it were mistranslations? How were they to study when  they were hard at work from week's end to week's end? It seems to me  downright wicked of scholars and learned men to keep their light hidden  away under a bushel, and then pretend that they fear the 'people' are  not ready for it.
"    "As though God's truth needed bolstering up with error!" exclaimed  Donovan.
 "As though to believe a hideous lie could ever be right  or helpful! There's a vast amount of Jesuitry among well-meaning  Protestants.
"    "And always will be, I should think," said Erica.
 "As long as people  will think of possible consequences, instead of the absolutely true.
  But I could forgive them all if their idea of the danger of telling the  people were founded on real study of the people.
 But is it? How many of  the conservers of half truths, who talk so loudly about the effect on  the masses, have personally known the men who go to make up the masses?"    "Yes, you are right," said Donovan.
 "As a rule I fancy the educated  classes know less about the working classes than they do about the  heathen, and I am afraid, care less about them.
 You have an immense  advantage there both as a writer and a worker, for I suppose you really  have been brought into contact with them.
"    "Yes," said Erica, "all my life.
 How I should like to confront Mr.  Cuthbert with a man like Hazeldine, or with dozens of others whom I  could name!"    "Why?" asked Donovan.
    "Because no one could really know such men without learning where  the present systems want mending.
 If Hazeldine could be shut into Mr.  Cuthbert's study for a few hours, and induced to tell the story of his  life, I believe he would have the effect of the ancient mariner on the  wedding guest.
 Only, the worst of it is, I'm afraid the very look of Mr.  Cuthbert would quite shut him up.
"    "Tell me about him," said Donovan.
    "It is nothing at second hand," said Erica.
 "He is a shoe maker, as  grand-looking a fellow as you ever saw, fond of reading, and very  thoughtful, and with more quiet common sense than almost any I ever met.
  He had been brought up to believe in verbal inspiration that had been  thoroughly crammed down his throat; but no one had attempted to touch  upon the contradictions, the thousand and one difficulties which of  course he found directly he began to study the Bible.
 So he puzzled and  puzzled, and got more and more dissatisfied, and never in church heard  anything which explained his difficulties.
 At last one day in his  workshop a man lent him a number of the 'Idol Breaker,' and in it was a  paper by my father on the Atonement.
 It came to him like a great light  in his darkness; he says he shall never forget the sudden conviction  that the man who wrote that article understood every one of his  difficulties, and would be able to clear them right away.
 The next  Sunday he went to hear my father lecture.
 I believe it would make the  veriest flint cry to hear his account of it, to see the look of reverent  love that comes over his face when he says, 'And there I found Mr.  Raeburn ready to answer all my difficulties, not holding one at arm's  length and talking big and patronizing for all he was so clever, but  just like a mate.
' That man would die for my father any day hundreds of  them would.
"    "I can well believe it," said Donovan.
 Then, after a pause, he added,  "To induce Christians to take a fair, unprejudiced look at true  secularism and to induce secularists to take a fair, unprejudiced view  of true Christ-following, seems to me to be the great need of today.
"    "If one could!" said Erica, with a long-drawn sigh.
    "If any one can, you can," he replied.
    She looked up at him quickly, awed by the earnestness of his tone.
 Was  she a young girl, conscious of so many faults and failings, conscious of  being at the very threshold herself to dare even to attempt such a task?  Yet was it a question of daring to attempt? Was it not rather the bit  of work mapped out for her, to undertake, perhaps to fail in, but still  bravely to attempt? He heart throbbed with eager yearning, as the vision  rose before her.
 What was mere personal pain? What was injustice? What  was misunderstanding? Why, in such a cause she could endure anything.
    "I would die to help on that!" she said in a low voice.
    "Will you live for it?" asked Donovan, with his rare, beautiful smile.
  "Live, and do something more than endure the Lady Carolines and Mr.  Cuthberts?"    Few things are more inspiriting that the realization that we are called  to some special work which will need our highest faculties, our untiring  exertions which will demand all that is good in us, and will make growth  in good imperative.
 With the peacefulness of that country Sunday was  interwoven a delicious perception that hard, beautiful work lay beyond.
  Erica wandered about the shady Mountshire woods with Gladys and the  children, and in the cool restfulness, in the stillness and beauty, got  a firm hold on her lofty ideal, and rose about the petty vexations and  small frictions which had been spoiling her life at Greyshot.
    The manor grounds were always thrown open to the public on Sunday, and  a band in connection with one of the temperance societies played on  the lawn.
 Donovan had been much persecuted by the Sabbatarians for  sanctioning this; but, though sorry to offend any one, he could not  allow what he considered mistaken scruples to interfere with such a boon  to the public.
 Crowds of workingmen and women came each week away from  their densely packed homes into the pure country; the place was for the  time given up to them, and they soon learned to love it, to look upon it  as a property to which they had a real and recognized share.
    Squire Ward, who owned the neighboring estate, grumbled a good deal at  the intrusion of what he called the "rabble" into quiet Oakdene.
    "That's the worst of such men as Farrant," he used to say.
 "They begin  by rushing to one extreme, and end by rushing to the other.
 Such a want  of steady conservative balance! He's a good man; but, poor fellow, he'll  never be like other people, never!"    Mrs. Ward was almost inclined to think that he had been less obnoxious  in the old times.
 As a professed atheist, he could be shunned and  ignored, but his uncomfortably practical Christianity had a way of  shaking up the sleepy neighborhood, and the neighborhood did not at all  like being shaken!        .
 Greyshot Again         To what purpose do you profess to believe in the unity of       the human race, which is the necessary consequence of the       unity of God, if you do not strive to verify it by       destroying the arbitrary divisions and enmities that still       separate the different tribes of humanity?  Why do we talk       of fraternity while we allow any of our brethren to be       trampled on, degraded or despised?  The earth is our       workshop.
  We may not curse it, we are bound to sanctify it.
      .
.
.
 We must strive to make of humanity one single family.
       Mazzini    Erica's appearance at Lady Caroline's dinner party had caused a sort  of storm in a tea cup; the small world of Greyshot was in a state  of ferment, and poor Mrs. Fane-Smith suffered a good deal from the  consciousness that she and her family were the subject of all the gossip  of the place.
 Her little expedients had failed, and she began to reflect  ruefully that perfect sincerity, plain honesty, would have been the best  policy, after all.
 By the time that a week had passed, however, censure  and harsh comments began to give place to curiosity, and the result  of this was that on Monday, which was Mrs. Fane-Smith's "at home" day,  Greyshot found it convenient to call in large numbers.
    Erica, returning from Oakdene in the afternoon, found her work awaiting  her.
 Her heart beat rather quickly when, on entering the drawing room  she found it full of visitors; she half smiled to herself to find such  an opportunity of beginning Donovan's work.
 And very bravely she set  about it.
 Those who had come from curiosity not unmixed with malice were  won in spite of themselves; even Mr. Cuthbert, who bore down upon her  with the full intention of making her uncomfortable, found himself  checkmated as effectually as at Lady Caroline's dinner table, though in  a very different way.
    "I think I saw you in church yesterday morning!" he remarked, by way of  introducing a discordant subject.
    "Yes," replied Erica, "I have been staying at Oakdene Manor, and had a  most delicious time.
"    "Sharing Mr. Farrant's philanthropic labors?" asked Mr. Cuthbert, with  his unpleasant smile.
    She laughed.
    "No; I have been thoroughly lazy, and September is their holiday month,  too.
 You would have been amused to see us the other evening all hard at  work making paper frogs like so many children.
"    "Paper frogs!" said Mr. Cuthbert, with an intonation that suggested  sarcasm.
    "Yes; have you ever seen them?" asked Erica.
 "I don't think many people  know how to make them.
 Feltrino taught me when I was a little girl I'll  show you, if you like.
"    "Did you ever meet Feltrino?" asked Lady Caroline.
    She knew very little of the Italian patriot.
 In his life time he  had been despised and rejected, but he was now dead; his biography a  well-written one was in all the circulating libraries, and even those  who were far from agreeing with his political views, had learned  something of the nobility of his character.
 So there was both surprise  and envy in Lady Caroline's tone; she had a weakness for celebrities.
    "I saw him once when I was seven years old," said Erica.
 "He knew  my father, and one day we were overtaken by a tremendous shower, and  happened to meet Feltrino, who made us come into his rooms and wait till  it was over.
 And while they talked Italian politics I sat and watched  him.
 He had the most wonderful eyes I ever saw, and presently, looking  up and seeing me, he laughed and took me on his knee, saying that  politics must not spoil my holiday, and that he would show me how  to make Japanese frogs.
 Once, when he was imprisoned, and was hardly  allowed to have any books, the making of those frogs kept him from going  mad, he said.
"    While she spoke she had been deftly folding a sheet of paper, and  several people were watching curiously.
 "Before very long, the frog  was completed, and the imitation proved so clever that there was an  unanimous chorus of approval and admiration.
 Every one wanted to learn  how to make them; the Feltrino frogs became the topic of the afternoon,  and Erica fairly conquered the malicious tongues.
 She was superintending  Lady Caroline's first attempt at a frog, when a familiar name made her  look up.
    "Mr. Cunningham Mr. Leslie Cunningham.
"    "I thought you were in Switzerland!" she exclaimed, as he crossed the  room and shook hands with her.
    "I never got further than Paris," he said, smiling.
 "My brother has  gone instead, and I am going to follow your example and study the  beauties of English scenery.
"    Perhaps Greyshot opinion was more conciliated by the long talk with Mr.  Leslie Cunningham, M.
P.
, than even by the Feltrino frogs.
 To have  Luke Raeburn's daughter suddenly thrust into the midst of their select  society at Lady Caroline's dinner was one thing they had one and  all shunned her.
 But when she proved to be, after all, clever and  fascinating, and original, when they knew that she had sat on Feltrino's  knee as a little child, above all, when they saw that Leslie Cunningham  was talking to her with mingled friendliness and deference, they veered  round.
 Politically, they hated Sir Michael Cunningham, but in society  they were pleased enough to meet him, and in Greyshot, naturally enough,  his son was a "lion.
" Greyshot made much of him during his stay at  Blachingbury, and he found it very convenient just then to be made much  of.
    Hardly a day of that week passed in which he did not in some way meet  Erica.
 He met her in the park with her aunt; he sat next to her at an  evening concert; he went to the theater and watched her all through  "Hamlet," and came to the Fane-Smith's box between the acts.
 Yet,  desperately as he was in love, he could not delude himself with the  belief that she cared for him.
 She was always bright, talkative, frank,  even friendly, but that was all.
 Yet her unlikeness to the monotonously  same girls, whom he was in the habit of meeting, fascinated him more and  more each day.
 She was to go back to town on the Monday; on Friday it so  happened that she met Leslie Cunningham at a great flower show, and with  perfect unconsciousness piqued him almost beyond endurance.
 Now at last  he hoped to make her understand his admiration.
 They discussed "Hamlet,"  and he had just brought the conversation adroitly round to the love  scene in the third act, when Erica suddenly dashed his hopes to the  ground.
    "Oh, how lovely!" she exclaimed, pausing before a beautiful exotic.
  "Surely that must be an orchid?"    And the reluctant Leslie found the conversation drifting round to  botany, about which he knew little and cared less.
 Once more his  hopes were raised only to be frustrated.
 He was sitting besides Mrs.  Fane-Smith and Erica, and had managed to stem the tide of the botany.
  The band was playing.
 Erica, half listening to the music and half  attending to his talk, looked dreamily peaceful; surely now was the  time! But all at once the clear eyes looked up with their perfectly  wide-awake interest, and she exclaimed:    "I do wish the Farrants would come! They certainly meant to be here.
 I  can't make it out.
"    Leslie patiently talked about the member for Greyshot; but, just when  he hoped he was quit of the subject, Erica gave an exclamation of such  unfeigned delight that a consuming envy took possession of him.
    "Oh, there he is! And Ralph and Dolly, too!"    And in a moment the Oakdene party had joined them, and Leslie saw that  his chances for that day were over.
 Before long he had made his escape,  leaving the grounds not moodily, but with the light of a new and eager  determination in his eye.
    Erica, returning from the flower show late in the afternoon, found a  note awaiting her, and opened it unconcernedly enough on her way up to  her room.
 But the first glance at it brought a glow of color to her face  and a nameless fear to her heart.
 She ran on quickly, locked her door,  and by the ruddy firelight read in a sort of dumb dismay her first offer  of marriage.
 This then was the meaning of it all.
 This was the cause of  his hurried return to England; this had brought her the long talks which  had been so pleasant, yes, strangely, unaccountably pleasant.
 Yet, for  all that, she knew well enough that she had nothing to give in return  for the love revealed in every word of the letter.
 She liked him, liked  to talk to him, thought him clever and interesting, but that was all.
  His wife! Oh, no! Impossible! That could never be! And then, as usual,  even in the midst of her strange sense of discomfort and perplexity,  there came a flash of humor which made her laugh noiselessly in the dim  light.
 "Tom would call me Mrs. Sly Bacon!"    But a second reading of the letter made her look grave.
 She was very  much puzzled to know how to answer it; how, in refusing, to give him  least pain.
 There was nothing else to hesitate about, of her own mind  she was quite sure.
 There was only an hour till post time.
 She must  write at once, and she must write in a way which could not be mistaken.
  There was not a grain of coquetry about Erica.
 After some thought she  wrote the following lines:    "Dear Mr. Cunningham, Your letter surprised me very much and pained me,  too, because in replying I fear I must give you pain.
 I thank you for  the honor you have done me, but I can never be your wife.
 Even if I  could return your love, which I can not, it could never be right.
 People  are so prejudiced that the connection of our names might greatly injure  your public work, and, besides, you could not live in the circle in  which I live, and nothing could ever make it right for me to leave my  own people.
 I can not write as I should like to I can not say what I  would, or thank you as I would but please understand me, and believe me  yours very sincerely, Erica Raeburn.
"    Strange enough the writing of that letter, the realization of the  impossibility of accepting Leslie Cunningham's offer, opened out to  Erica a new region, started her upon a new stage of her life progress.
  In spite of her trouble at the thought of the pain she must give, there  was an indefinable sense that life and love meant much more than she had  hitherto dreamed of; and, though for the next few days she was a little  grave and silent, there rang in her ears the refrain:    "Oh, life, oh, beyond, Thou art strange, thou art sweet.
"    She was not sorry that her visit was drawing to a close, although the  last week had gone much more smoothly.
 Her vigorous nature began to long  to return to the working day world, and though she could very honestly  thank Mr. Fane-Smith for his kindness, she turned her back on his house  with unmixed satisfaction.
    "And you cannot change your ind as to my suggestion?" he asked sending  off one parting arrow.
    "I can not," said Erica, firmly, "he is my father.
"    "You must of course make your own choice," he said with a sigh.
 "But you  are sadly wrong, sadly wrong! In my opinion your father is--"    "Forgive me for interrupting you," said Erica, "but by your own showing  you have no right to have any opinion whatever about my father.
 Until  you have either learned to know him personally, heard him speak, or  fairly and carefully studied his writings, you have no grounds to form  an opinion upon.
"    "But the current opinion is--"    "The current opinion is no more an opinion than yours! It is the view  of most bitter opponents.
 And, candidly, WOULD you accept the current  opinion held of any prominent statesman by his adversaries? Why, the  best men living are represented as fiends in human shape by their  enemies! And if this is so in political matters, how much more in such a  case as my father's!"    Mr. Fane-Smith, who was a well-meaning though narrow man, sighed again;  it was always very painful to him to listen to views which did not  coincide with his own.
    "Well," he said at length, "there is, after all, the hope that you may  convert him.
"    "I hope you do not want me to turn into one of those hateful little  prigs, who go about lamenting over their unregenerate parents," said  Erica, naughtily.
 Then, softening down, she added, "I think I know what  you mean perhaps I was wrong to speak like that, only somehow, knowing  what my father is, it does grate so to put it in that way.
 But don't  think I would not give my life for him to come to the light here and now  for I would! I would!"    She clasped her hands tightly together, and turned quickly away.
    Mr. Fane-Smith was touched.
    "Well, my dear," he said.
 "You may be right, after all, and I may be  wrong.
 All my anxiety is only for your ultimate good.
"    The train was on the point of starting, he gave her a warm hand shake,  and in spite of all that jarred in their respective natures, Erica ended  by liking him the best of her new relations.

         Not out of malice, but mere zeal,       Because he was an infidel.
       Hudibras    "Blessed old London, how delightful it is to come back to it!" exclaimed  Erica, as she and Tom drove home from Paddington on the afternoon of her  return from Greyshot.
 "Tell the man not to go through the back streets,  there's a good boy! Ah, he's doing it of his own accord! Why, the park  trees are much browner than the Mountshire ones!"    "We have been prophesying all manner of evil about your coming back,"  said Tom looking her over critically from head to foot.
 "I believe  mother thought you would never come that the good Christians down at  Greyshot having caught you would keep you, and even the chieftain was  the least bit in the world uneasy.
"    "Nonsense," said Erica, laughing, "he knows better.
"    "But they did want to keep you?"    "Yes.
"    "How did you get out of it?"    "Said, 'Much obliged to you, but I'd rather not.
' Enacted Mrs. Micawber,  you know, 'I never will, no I never will leave Mr. Micawber.
'"    "Mr. Fane-Smith must have been a brute ever to have proposed such a  thing!"    "Oh, no! Not at all! Within certain limits he is a kind-hearted man,  only he is one of those who believe in that hateful saying, 'Men without  the knowledge of God are cattle.
' And, believing that, would treat  atheists as I should be sorry to treat Friskarina.
"    "And what is the world of Greyshot like?"    "It is very lukewarm about public questions, and very boiling hot about  its own private affairs," said Erica.
 "But I have learned now how people  in society can go on contentedly living their easy lives in the midst of  such ignorance and misery.
 They never investigate, and when any painful  instance is alluded to, they say, 'Oh! But it CAN'T be true!' The  other day they were speaking of Kingsley's pamphlet, 'Cheap clothes and  nasty,' and one lady said that was quite an evil of the past, that the  difficulty nowadays was to get things at reasonable prices.
 When I told  her that women only get twopence for doing all the machine work of an  ulster, and have to provide their machine, cotton, food, light, and  fuel, she exclaimed, 'Oh, that is incredible! It must be exaggerated!  Such things couldn't be now!' When Aunt Isabel heard that I had known  cases of men being refused admission to a hospital supported by  public subscriptions, on the ground of their atheism, she said it was  impossible.
 And as to physical ill treatment, or, in fact, any injustice  having ever been shown by Christian to atheist, she would not hear of  it.
 It was always 'My dear, the atmosphere in which you have lived has  distorted your vision,' or, 'You have been told, my dear, that these  things were so!' To tell her that they were facts which could be  verified was not the smallest good, for she wouldn't so much as touch  any publication connected with secularism.
"    "None are so blind as those who will not see," said Tom.
 "They will go  on in this way till some great national crisis, some crash which they  can't ignore, wakes them up from their comfortable state.
 'It can't be  true,' is no doubt a capital narcotic.
"    "Father is at home, I suppose? How do you think he is?"    "Oh, very well, but fearfully busy.
 The 'Miracles' trial will probably  come on in November.
"    Erica sighed.
 There was a silence.
 She looked out rather sadly at the  familiar Oxford Street shops.
    "You have not come back approving of the Blasphemy Laws, I hope?" said  Tom, misinterpreting her sigh.
    Her eyes flashed.
    "Of course not!" she said, emphatically.
    "Mr. Osmond has, as usual, been getting into hot water for speaking a  word on the chieftain's behalf.
"    "Did he speak? I am glad of that," said Erica, brightening.
 "I expect  Mr. Pogson's conduct will stir up a good many liberal Christians into  showing their disapproval of bigotry and injustice.
 Ah! Here is the dear  old square! The statue looks ten degrees moldier than when I left!"    In fact everything looked, as Erica expressed it, "moldier!"  "Persecution Alley," the lodging house, the very chairs and tables  seemed to obtrude their shabbiness upon her.
 Not that she cared in the  least; for, however shabby, it was home the home that she had longed for  again and again in the luxury and ease of Greyshot.
    Raeburn looked up from a huge law book as she opened the door of his  study.
    "Why, little son Eric!" he exclaimed.
 "You came so quietly that I never  heard you.
 Glad to have you home again, my child! The room looks as if  it needed you, doesn't it?"    Erica laughed for the study was indeed in a state of chaos.
 Books were  stacked up on the floor, on the mantel piece, on the chairs, on the  very steps of the book ladder.
 The writing table was a sea of papers,  periodicals, proofs, and manuscripts, upon which there floated with  much difficulty Raeburn's writing desk and the book he was reading, some  slight depression in the surrounding mass of papers showing where his  elbows had been.
    "About equal to Teufelsdroch's room, isn't it?" he said, smiling.
  "Everything united in a common element of dust.
' But, really, after the  first terrible day of your absence, when I wasted at least an hour in  hunting for things which the tidy domestic had carefully hidden, I could  stand it no longer, and gave orders that no one was to bring brush or  duster or spirit of tidiness within the place.
"    "We really must try to get you a larger room," said Erica, looking  round.
 "How little and poky everything looks.
"    "Has Greyshot made you discontented?"    "Only for you," she replied, laughing.
 "I was thinking of Mr.  Fane-Smith's great study; it seems such a pity that five foot three,  with few books and nothing to do, should have all that space, and six  foot four, with much work and many books, be cramped up in this little  room.
"    "What would you say to a move?"    "It will be such an expensive year, and there's that dreadful Mr. Pogson  always in the background.
"    "But if a house were given to us? Where's Tom? I've a letter here which  concerns you both.
 Do either of you remember anything about an old Mr.  Woodward who lived at 16 Guilford Square?"    "Why, yes! Don't you remember, Tom? The old gentleman whose greenhouse  we smashed.
"    "Rather!" said Tom.
 "I've the marks of the beastly thing now.
"    "What was it? Let me hear the story," said Raeburn, leaning back in his  chair with a look of amusement flickering about his rather stern face.
    "Why, father, it was years ago; you were on your first tour in America,  I must have been about twelve, and Tom fourteen.
 We had only just  settled in here, you know; and one unlucky Saturday we were playing in  the garden at 'King of the Castle.
'"    "What's that?" asked Raeburn.
    "Why, Tom was king, and I was the Republican Army; and Tom was standing  on the top of the wall trying to push me down.
 He had to sing:         "'I'm the king of the castle! Get down, you dirty rascal!'    And somehow I don't know how it was instead of climbing up, I pushed him  backward by mistake, and he went down with an awful crash into the next  garden.
 We knew it was the garden belonging to No.
 16 quite a large  one it is for the hospital hasn't any.
 And when at last I managed to  scramble on to the wall, there was Tom, head downward, with his feet  sticking up through the roof of a greenhouse, and the rest of him all  among the flower pots.
"    Raeburn laughed heartily.
    "There was a brute of a cactus jammed against my face, too," said Tom.
  "How I ever got out alive was a marvel!"    "Well, what happened?" asked Raeburn.
    "Why, we went round to tell the No.
 16 people.
 Tom waited outside,  because he was so frightfully cut about, and I went in and saw an old,  old man a sort of Methusaleh who would ask my name, and whether I had  anything to do with you.
"    "What did you say to him?"    "I can't remember except that I asked him to let us pay for the glass by  installments, and tried to assure him that secularists were not in the  habit of smashing other people's property.
 He was a very jolly old man,  and of course he wouldn't let us pay for the glass though he frightened  me dreadfully by muttering that he shouldn't wonder if the glass and the  honesty combined cost him a pretty penny.
"    "Did you ever see him again?"    "Not to speak to, but we always nodded to each other when we passed in  the square.
 I've not seen him for ages.
 I thought he must be dead.
"    "He is dead," said Raeburn; "and he has left you three hundred pounds,  and he has left me his furnished house, with the sole proviso that I  live in it.
"    "What a brick!" cried Tom and Erica, in a breath.
 "Now fancy, if we  hadn't played at 'King of the Castle' that day!"    "And if Erica had not been such a zealous little Republican?" said  Raeburn, smiling.
    "Why, father, the very greenhouse will belong to you; and such a nice  piece of garden! Oh, when can we go and see it, and choose a nice room  for your study?"    "I will see Mr. Woodward's executor tomorrow morning," said Raeburn.
  "The sooner we move in the better for there are rocks ahead.
"    "The 'we' refers only to you and Erica," said Aunt Jean, who had joined  them.
 "Tom and I shall of course stay on here.
"    "Oh, no, auntie!" cried Erica in such genuine dismay that Aunt Jean was  touched.
    "I don't want you to feel at all bound to have us," she said.
 "Now that  the worst of the poverty is over, there is no necessity for clubbing  together.
"    "And after you have shared all the discomforts with us, you think we  should go off in such a dog-in-the-mangerish way as that!" cried Erica.
  "Besides, it really was chiefly owing to Tom, who was the one to get  hurt into the bargain.
 If you won't come, I shall--" she paused to  think of a threat terrible enough, "I shall think again about living  with the Fane-Smiths.
"    This led the conversation back to Greyshot, and they lingered so long  round the fire talking that Raeburn was for once unpunctual, and kept an  audience at least ten minutes waiting for him.
    No.
 16 Guilford Square proved to be much better inside than a casual  passer in the street would have imagined.
 Outside, it was certainly a  grim-looking house, but within it was roomy and comfortable.
 The lower  rooms were wainscoted in a sort of yellowish-brown color, the upper  wainscoted in olive-green.
 There was no such thing as a wall paper in  the whole house, and indeed it was hard to imagine, when once inside it,  that you were in nineteenth-century London at all.
    Raeburn, going over it with Erica the following evening, was a little  amused to think of himself domiciled in such an old-world house.
 Mr.  Woodward's housekeeper, who was still taking care of the place,  assured them that one of the leaden pipes outside bore the date of the  seventeenth century, though the two last figures were so illegible that  they might very possibly have stood for 1699.
    Erica was delighted with it all, and went on private voyages of  discovery, while her father talked to the housekeeper, taking stock of  the furniture, imagining how she would rearrange the rooms, and planning  many purchases to be made with her three hundred pounds.
 She was singing  to herself for very lightness of heart when her father called her from  below.
 She rand down again, checking her inclination to sing as she  remembered the old housekeeper, who had but recently lost her master.
    "I've rather set my affections on this room," said Raeburn, leading her  into what had formerly been the dining room.
    "The very place where I came in fear and trembling to make my  confession," said Erica, laughing.
 "This would make a capital study.
"    "Yes, the good woman has gone to fetch an inch tape; I want to measure  for the book shelves.
 How many of my books could I comfortably house in  here, do you think?"    "A good many.
 The room is high, you see; and those two long, unbroken  walls would take several hundred.
 Ah! Here is the measuring tape.
 Now we  can calculate.
"    They were hard at work measuring when the door bell rang, and Tom's  voice was heard in the passage, asking for Raeburn.
    "This way, Tom!" called Erica.
 "Come and help us!"    But a laughing reference to the day of their childish disaster died on  her lips when she caught sight of him for she knew that something was  wrong.
 Accustomed all her life to live in the region of storms, she had  learned to a nicety the tokens of rough weather.
    "Hazeldine wishes to speak to you," said Tom, turning to Raeburn.
 "I  brought him round here to save time.
"    "Oh! All right," said Raeburn, too much absorbed in planning the  arrangement of his treasures to notice the unusual graveness of Tom's  face.
 "Ask him in here.
 Good evening, Hazeldine.
 You are the first to  see us in our new quarters.
"    Hazeldine bore traces of having lived from his childhood a hard but  sedentary life.
 He was under-sized and narrow chested.
 But the face was  a very striking one, the forehead finely developed, the features clearly  cut, and the bright, dark eyes looking out on the world with an almost  defiant honesty, a clearness bordering on hardness.
    Raeburn, entirely putting aside for the time his own affairs, and giving  to his visitor his whole and undivided attention, saw in an instant that  the man was in trouble.
    "Out of work again?" he asked.
 "Anything gone wrong?"    "No sir," replied Hazeldine; "but I came round to ask if you'd seen  that circular letter.
 'Twas sent me this morning by a mate of mine who's  lately gone to Longstaff, and he says that this Pogson is sowing them  broadcast among the hands right through all the workshops in the place,  and in all England, too, for aught he knows.
 I wouldn't so much as touch  the dirty thing, only I thought maybe you hadn't heard of it.
"    Without a word, Raeburn held out his hand for the printed letter.
 Erica,  standing at a little distance, watched the faces of the three men Tom,  grave, yet somewhat flushed; Hazeldine, with a scornful glitter in  his dark eyes; her father? Last of all she looked at him and looking,  learned the full gravity of this new trouble.
 For, as he read, Raeburn  grew white, with the marble whiteness which means that intense anger  has interfered with the action of the heart.
 As he hastily perused the  lines, his eyes seemed to flash fire; the hand which still held the  measuring tape was clinched so tightly that the knuckle looked like  polished ivory.
    Erica could not ask what was the matter, but she came close to him.
 When  he had finished reading, the first thing his eye fell upon was her face  turned up to his with a mute appeal which, in spite of the anxiety in  it, made her look almost like a child.
 He shrank back as she held  out her hand for the letter; it was so foul a libel that it seemed  intolerable to him that his own child should so much as read a line of  it.
    "What is it?" she asked at length, speaking with difficulty.
    "A filthy libel circulated by that liar Pogson! A string of lies  invented by his own evil brain! Why should I keep it from you? It is  impossible! The poisonous thing is sown broadcast through the land.
 You  are of age there read it, and see how vile a Christian can be!"    He was writhing under the insult, and was too furious to measure his  words.
 It was only when he saw Erica's brave lip quiver that he felt  with remorse that he had doubled her pain.
    She had turned a little away from him, ostensibly to be nearer to the  gas, but in reality that he might not see the crimson color which surged  up into her face as she read.
 Mr. Pogson was as unscrupulous as fanatics  invariably are.
 With a view of warning the public and inducing them to  help him in crushing the false doctrine he abhorred, he had tried to  stimulate them by publishing a sketch of Raeburn's personal character  and life, drawn chiefly from his imagination, or from distorted and  misquoted anecdotes which had for years been bandied about among his  opponents, losing nothing in the process.
 Hatred of the man Luke Raeburn  was his own great stimulus, and we are apt to judge others by ourselves.
  The publication of this letter really seemed to him likely to do great  good, and the evil passions of hatred and bigotry had so inflamed his  mind, that it was perfectly easy for him to persuade himself that the  statements were true.
 Indeed, he only followed with the multitude to  do evil in this instance, for not one in a thousand took the trouble  to verify their facts, or even their quotations, when speaking of, or  quoting Raeburn.
 The libel, to put it briefly, represented Raeburn as a  man who had broken every one of the ten commandments.
    Erica read steadily on, though every pulse in her beat at double time.
  It was long before she finished it, for a three-fold chorus was going on  in her brain Mr. Pogson's libelous charges; the talk between her father  and Hazeldine, which revealed all too plainly the harm already done  to the cause of Christianity by this one unscrupulous man; and her own  almost despairing cry to the Unseen: "Oh, Father! How is he ever to  learn to know Thee, when such things as these are done in Thy name?"    That little sheet of paper had fallen among them like a thunderbolt.
    "I have passed over a great deal," Raeburn was saying when Erica looked  up once more.
 "But I shall not pass over this! Pogson shall pay dearly  for it! Many thanks, Hazeldine, for bringing me word; I shall take steps  about it at once.
"    He left the room quickly, and in another minute they heard the street  door close behind him.
    "That means an action for libel," said Tom, knitting his brows.
 "And  goodness only knows what fearful work and worry for the chieftain.
"    "But good to the cause in the long run," said Hazeldine.
 "And as for Mr.  Raeburn, he only rises the higher the more they try to crush him.
 He's  like the bird that rises out of its own ashes the phenix, don't they  call it?"    Erica smiled a little at the comparison, but sadly.
    "Don't judge Christianity by this one bad specimen," she said, as she  shook hands with Hazeldine.
    "How do Christians judge us, Miss Erica?" he replied, sternly.
    "Then be more just than you think they are as generous as you would have  them be.
"    "It's but a working-day world, miss, and I'm but a working-day man.
 I  can't set up to be generous to them who treat a man as though he was  the dirt in the street.
 And if you will excuse me mentioning it, miss,  I could wish that this shameful treatment would show to you what a  delusion it is you've taken up of late.
"    "Mr. Pogson can hurt me very much, but not so fatally as that," said  Erica, as much to herself as to Hazeldine.
    When he had gone she picked up the measure once more, and turned to Tom.
    "Help me just to finish this, Tom," she said.
 "We must try to move in as  quickly as may be.
"    Tom silently took the other end of the tape, and they set to work again;  but all the enjoyment in the new house seemed quenched and destroyed  by that blast of calumny.
 They knew only too well that this was but the  beginning of troubles.
    Raeburn, remembering his hasty speech, called Erica into the study the  moment he heard her return.
 He was still very pale, and with a curiously  rigid look about his face.
    "I was right, you see, in my prophecy of rocks ahead," he exclaimed,  throwing down his pen.
 "You have come home to a rough time, Erica, and  to an overharassed father.
"    "The more harassed the father, the more reason that he should have a  child to help him," said Erica, sitting down on the arm of his chair,  and putting back the masses of white hair which hung over his forehead.
    "Oh, child!" he said, with a sigh, "if I can but keep a cool head and a  broad heart through the years of trouble before us!"    "Years!" exclaimed Erica, dismayed.
    "This affair may drag on almost indefinitely, and a personal strife is  apt to be lowering.
"    "Yes," said Erica, musingly, "to be libeled does set one's back up  dreadfully, and to be much praised humbles one to the very dust.
"    "What will the Fane-Smiths say to this? Will they believe it of me?"    "I can't tell," said Erica, hesitatingly.
    "'He that's evil deemed is half hanged,'" said Raeburn bitterly.
 "Never  was there a truer saying than that.
"    "'Blaw the wind ne'er so fast, it will lown at the last'" quoted Erica,  smiling.
 "Equally true, PADRE MIO.
"    "Yes, dear," he said quietly, "but not in my life time.
 You see if I  let this pass, the lies will be circulated, and they'll say I can't  contradict them.
 If I bring an action against the fellow, people will  say I do it to flaunt my opinions in the face of the public.
 As your  hero Livingstone once remarked, 'Isn't it interesting to get blamed for  everything?' However, we must make the best of it.
 How about the new  house? When can we settle in? I feel a longing for that study with its  twenty-two feet o' length for pacing!"    "What are your engagements?" she asked, taking up a book from the table.
  "Eleventh, Newcastle; 12th, Nottingham; 13th and 14th, Plymouth.
 Let  me see, that will bring you home on Monday, the 15th, and will leave us  three clear days to get things straight; that will do capitally.
"    "And you'll be sure to see that the books are carefully moved," said  Raeburn.
 "I can't have the markers displaced.
"    Erica laughed.
 Her father had a habit of putting candle lighters in  his books to mark places for references, and the appearance of the  book shelves all bristling with them had long been a family joke, more  especially as, if a candle lighter happened to be wanted for its proper  purpose, there was never one to be found.
    "I will pack them myself," she said.
        .
 Brian as Avenger         A paleness took the poet's cheek;       "Must I drink here?" he seemed to seek       The lady's will with utterance meek.
         "Ay, ay," she said, "it so must be,"       (And this time she spake cheerfully)       "Behooves thee know world's cruelty.
"  E.
 B.
 Browning    The trial of Luke Raeburn, on the charge of having published a  blasphemous libel in a pamphlet entitled "Bible Miracles," came on in  the Court of Queen's Bench early in December.
 It excited a great deal of  interest.
 Some people hoped that the revival of an almost obsolete law  would really help to check the spread of heterodox views, and praised  Mr. Pogson for his energy and religious zeal.
 These were chiefly  well-meaning folks, not much given to the study of precedents.
 Some  people of a more liberal turn read the pamphlet in question, and were  surprised to see that matter quite as heterodox might be found in many  high-class reviews which lay about on drawing room tables, the only  difference being that the articles in the reviews were written in  somewhat ambiguous language by fashionable agnostics, and that "Bible  Miracles" was a plain, blunt, sixpenny tract, avowedly written for the  people by the people's tribune.
    This general interest and attention, once excited, gave rise to the  following results: to an indiscriminate and wholesale condemnation of  "that odious Raeburn who was always seeking notoriety;" to an immense  demand for "Bible Miracles," which in three months reached its fiftieth  thousand; and to a considerable crowd in Westminster Hall on the first  day of the trial, to watch the entrance and exit of the celebrities.
    Erica had been all day in the court.
 She had written her article for  the "Daily Review: in pencil during the break for luncheon; but, as  time wore on, the heated atmosphere of the place, which was crammed  to suffocation, became intolerable to her.
 She grew whiter and whiter,  began to hear the voices indistinctly, and to feel as if her arms did  not belong to her.
 It would never do to faint in court, and vexed as she  was to leave, she took the first opportunity of speaking to her father.
    "I think I must go," she whispered, "I can't stand this heat.
"    "Come now, then," said Raeburn, "and I can see you out.
 This witness  has nothing worth listening to.
 Take notes for me, Tom.
 I'll be back  directly.
"    They had only just passed the door leading into Westminster Hall,  however, when Tom sent a messenger hurrying after them.
 An important  witness had that minute been called, and Raeburn, who was, as usual,  conducting his own case, could not possibly miss the evidence.
    "I can go alone," said Erica.
 "Don't stop.
"    But even in his haste, Raeburn, glancing at the crowd of curious faces,  was thoughtful for his child.
    "No," he said, hurriedly.
 "Wait a moment, and I'll send some one to  you.
"    She would have been wiser if she had followed him back into the court;  but, having once escaped from the intolerable atmosphere, she was not  at all inclined to return to it.
 She waited where he had left her,  just within Westminster Hall, at the top of the steps leading from  the entrance to the court.
 The grandeur of the place, its magnificent  proportions, terminating in the great, upward sweep of steps, and the  mellow stained window, struck her more than ever after coming from the  crowded and inconvenient little court within.
 The vaulted roof, with its  quaintly carved angels, was for the most part dim and shadowy, but here  and there a ray of sunshine, slanting in through the clerestory windows,  changed the sombre tones to a golden splendor.
 Erica, very susceptible  to all high influences, was more conscious of the ennobling influence  of light, and space, and beauty than of the curious eyes which were  watching her from below.
 But all at once her attention was drawn to a  group of men who stood near her, and her thoughts were suddenly brought  back to the hard, every-day world, from which for a brief moment she had  escaped.
 With a quick, apprehensive glance, she noted that among them  was a certain Sir Algernon Wyte, a man who never lost an opportunity of  insulting her father.
    "Did you see the fellow?" said one of the group.
 "He came to the door  just now.
"    "And left his fair daughter to be a spectacle to men and angels?" said  Sir Algernon.
    Then followed words so monstrous, so intolerable, that Erica, accustomed  as she was to discourtesies, broke down altogether.
 It was so heartless,  so cruelly false, and she was so perfectly defenseless! A wave of  burning color swept over her face.
 If she could but have gone away  have hidden herself from those cruel eyes.
 But her knees trembled so  fearfully that, had she tried to move, she must have fallen.
 Sick and  giddy, the flights of steps looked to her like a precipice.
 She could  only lean for support against the gray-stone moldings of the door way,  while tears, which for once she could not restrain, rushed to her eyes.
  Oh! If Tom or the professor, or some one would but come to her! Such  moments as those are not measured by earthly time; the misery seemed to  her agelong though it was in reality brief enough for Brian, coming into  Westminster Hall, had actually heard Sir Algernon's shameful  slander, and pushing his way through the crowd, was beside her almost  immediately.
    The sight of his face checked her tears.
 It positively frightened her by  its restrained yet intense passion.
    "Miss Raeburn," he said, in a clear, distinct voice, plainly heard  by the group below, "this is not a fit place for you.
 Let me take you  home.
"    He spoke much more formally than was his wont, yet in his actions he  used a sort of authority, drawing her hand within his arm, leading  her rapidly through the crowd, which opened before them.
 For that one  bitter-sweet moment she belonged to him.
 He was her sole, and therefore  her rightful, protector.
 A minute more, and they stood in Palace Yard.
  He hastily called a hansom.
    In the pause she looked up at him, and would have spoken her thanks, but  something in his manner checked her.
 He had treated her so exactly as  if she belonged to him, that, to thank him seemed almost as absurd as  it would have done to thank her father.
 Then a sudden fear made her say  instead:    "Are you coming home?"    "I will come to see that you are safely back presently," he said, in a  voice unlike his own.
 "But I must see that man first.
"    "No, no," she said, beginning to tremble again.
 "Don't go back.
 Please,  please don't go!"    "I must," he said, putting her into the hansom.
 Then, speaking very  gently.
 "Don't be afraid; I will be with you almost directly.
"    He closed the doors, gave the address to the driver, and turned away.
    Erica was conscious of a vague relief as the fresh winter wind blew  upon her.
 She shut her eyes, that she might not see the passers-by, only  longing to get away right away, somewhere beyond the reach of staring  eyes and cruel tongues.
 One evening years ago, she remembered coming out  of St.
 James's Hall with Tom, and having heard a woman in Regent Street  insulted in precisely the same language that had been used to her today.
  She remembered how the shrill, passionate cry had rung down the street:  "How dare you insult me!" And remembered, too, how she had wondered  whether perfect innocence would have been able to give that retort.
 She  knew now that her surmise had been correct.
 The insult had struck her  dumb for the time.
 Even now, as the words returned to her with a pain  intolerable, her tears rained down.
 It seemed to her that for once she  could no more help crying than she could have helped bleeding when cut.
    Then once more her thoughts returned to Brian with a warmth of gratitude  which in itself relieved her.
 He was a man worth knowing, a friend worth  having.
 Yet how awful his face had looked as he came toward her.
 Only  once in her whole life had she seen such a look on a man's face.
 She had  seen it in her childhood on her father's face, when he had first heard  of a shameful libel which affected those nearest and dearest to him.
  She had been far too young to understand the meaning of it, but she well  remembered that silent, consuming wrath; she remembered running away by  herself with the sort of half-fearful delight of a child's new discovery  "Now I know how men look when they KILL!"    All at once, in the light of that old recollection, the truth dashed  upon her.
 She smiled through her tears, a soft glow stole over her face,  a warmth found its way to her aching heart.
 For at last the love of  seven years had found its way to her.
    She felt all in a glad tumult as that perception came to her.
 It had, in  truth, been an afternoon of revelations.
 She had never until now in the  least understood Brian's character, never in the least appreciated  him.
 And as to dreaming that his friendship had been love from the very  first, it had never occurred to her.
    The revelation did not bring her unalloyed happiness for there came a  sharp pang as she recollected what he had gone back to do.
 What if  he should get into trouble on her behalf? What if he should be hurt?  Accustomed always to fear for her father actual physical injury, her  thoughts at once flew to the same danger for Brian.
 But, however sick  with anxiety, she was obliged, on reaching home, to try and copy out her  article, which must be in type and upon thousands of breakfast tables by  the next morning whether her heart ached or not, whether her life were  rough or smooth.
    In the meantime, Brian, having watched her cab drive off, turned back  into Westminster Hall.
 He could see nothing but the one vision which  filled his brain the face of the girl he loved, a lovely, pure face  suffused with tears.
 He could hear nothing but that intolerable slander  which filled his heart with a burning, raging indignation.
 Straight as  an arrow and as if by instinct, he made his way to the place where  Sir Algernon and three or four companions were pacing to and fro.
 He  confronted them, bringing their walk to an enforced pause.
    "I am here to demand an apology for the words you spoke just now about  Miss Raeburn," he said, speaking in a voice which was none the less  impressive because it trembled slightly as with a wrath restrained only  by a great effort.
    Sir Algernon, a florid, light-haired man of about thirty, coolly stared  at him for a moment.
    "Who may you be, sir, who take up the cudgels so warmly in Miss  Raeburn's defense?"    "A man who will not hear a defenseless girl insulted," said Brian, his  voice rising.
 "Apologize!"    "Defenseless girl!" repeated the other in a tone so insufferable that  Brian's passion leaped up like wild fire.
    "You vile blackguard!" he cried, "what you said was an infernal lie, and  if you don't retract it this moment, I'll thrash you within an inch of  your life.
"    Sir Algernon laughed and shrugged his shoulders.
    "'Pon my life!" he exclaimed, turning to one of his companions, "if I'd  know that Miss Raeburn--"    But the sentence was never ended for, with a look of fury, Brian sprung  at him, seized him by the collar of his coat, and holding him like  a vise with one hand, with the other brought down his cane upon the  slanderer's shoulders with such energy that the wretch writhed beneath  it.
    The on-lookers, being gentlemen and fully aware that Sir Algernon  deserved all he was getting, stood by, not offering to interfere,  perhaps in their hearts rather sympathizing with the stranger whose  righteous indignation had about it a manliness that appealed to them.
  Presently Sir Algernon ceased to kick, his struggles grew fainter.
 Brian  let his right arm pause then, and with his left flung his foe into the  corner as if he had been a mere chattel.
    "There!" he exclaimed, "summons me for that when you please.
" And,  handing his card to one of Sir Algernon's companions, he strode out of  the hall.
    By the time he reached Guilford Square he was almost himself again, a  little paler than usual but outwardly quite calm.
 He went at once to  No.
 16.
 The Raeburns had now been settled in their new quarters for  some weeks, and the house was familiar enough to him; he went up to the  drawing room or, as it was usually called, the green room.
 The gas was  not lighted, but a little reading lamp stood upon a table in one of the  windows, and the fire light made the paneled walls shine here and there  though the corners and recesses were all in dusky shadow.
 Erica had made  this the most home-like room in the house; it had the most beguiling  easy chairs, it had all Mr. Woodward's best pictures, it had fascinating  little tables, and a tempting set of books.
 There was something in the  sight of the familiar room which made Brian's wrath flame up once more.
  Erica's guileless life seemed to rise before him the years of patient  study, the beautiful filial love, the pathetic endeavor to restrain her  child-like impatience of conventionalities lest scandalmongers should  have even a shadow of excuse for slandering Luke Raeburn's daughter.
 The  brutality of the insult struck him more than ever.
 Erica, glancing  up from her writing table, saw that his face again bore that look of  intolerable pain which had so greatly startled her in Westminster Hall.
    She had more than half dreaded his arrival, had been wondering how they  should meet after the strange revelation of the afternoon, had been  thinking of the most trite and commonplace remark with which she might  greet him.
 But when it actually came to the point, she could not say a  word, only looked up at him with eyes full of anxious questioning.
    "It is all right," he said, answering the mute question, a great joy  thrilling him as he saw that she had been anxious about him.
 "You should  not have been afraid.
"    "I couldn't help it," she said, coloring, "he is such a hateful man! A  man who might do anything.
 Tell me what happened.
"    "I gave him a thrashing which he'll not soon forget," said Brian.
 "But  don't let us speak of him any more.
"    "Perhaps he'll summons you!" said Erica.
    "He won't dare to.
 He knows that he deserved it.
 What are you writing?  You ought to be resting.
"    "Only copying out my article.
 The boy will be here before long.
"    "I am your doctor," he said, feeling her pulse, and again assuming his  authoritative manner; "I shall order you to rest on your couch at once.
  I will copy this for you.
 What is it on?"    "Cremation," said Erica, smiling a little.
 "A nice funereal subject for  a dreary day.
 Generally, if I'm in wild spirits, Mr. Bircham sends me  the very gloomiest subject to write on, and if I'm particularly blue, he  asks for a bright, lively article.
"    "Oh! He tells you what to write on?"    "Yes, did you think I had the luxury of choosing for myself? Every day,  about eleven o'clock a small boy brings me my fate on a slip of paper.
  Let me dictate this to you.
 I'm sure you can't read that penciled  scribble.
"    "Yes, I can," said Brian.
 "You go and rest.
"    She obeyed him, thankful enough to have a moment's pause in which to  think out the questions that came crowding into her mind.
 She hardly  dared to think what Brian might be to her, for just now she needed him  so sorely as friend and adviser, that to admit that other perception,  which made her feel shy and constrained with him, would have left her  still in her isolation.
 After all, he was a seven years' friend, no mere  acquaintance, but an actual friend to whom she was her unreserved and  perfectly natural self.
    "Brian," she said presently when he had finished her copying, "you don't  think I'm bound to tell my father about this afternoon, do you?"    A burning, painful blush, the sort of blush that she never ought to have  known, never could have known but for that shameful slander, spread over  her face and neck as she spoke.
    "Perhaps not," said Brian, "since the man has been properly punished.
"    "I think I hope it need never get round to him in any other way," said  Erica.
 "He would be so fearfully angry, and just now scarcely a day  passes without bringing him some fresh worry.
"    "When will the Pogson affair come on?"    "Oh! I don't know.
 Not just yet, I'm afraid.
 Things in the legal world  always move at the rate of a fly in a glue pot.
"    "What sort of man is Mr. Pogson?"    "He was in court today, a little, sleek, narrow-headed man with cold,  gray eyes.
 I have been trying to put myself in his place, and realize  the view he takes of things; but it is very, very hard.
 You don't know  what it is to live in this house and see the awful harm his intolerance  is bringing about.
"    "In what way did you specially mean?"    "Oh! In a thousand ways.
 It is bringing Christianity into discredit,  it is making them more bitter against it, and who can wonder.
 It is  bringing hundreds of men to atheism, it is enormously increasing the  demand for all my father's books, and already even in these few months  it has doubled the sale of the 'Idol-Breakers.
' In old times that would  have been my consolation.
 Oh! It is heart-breaking to see how religious  people injure their own cause.
 Surely they might have learned by this  time that punishment for opinion is never right, that it brings only  bitterness, and misery, and more error! How is one to believe that  this is right that God means all this bigotry and injustice to go on  producing evil?"    "Surely it will teach the sharp lesson that all pain teaches," said  Brian.
 "We Christians have broken His order, have lost the true idea of  brotherly love, and from this arises pain and evil, which at last, when  it touches our own selfish natures, will rouse us, wake us up  sharply, drive us back of necessity to the true Christ-following.
 Then  persecution and injustice will die.
 But we are so terribly asleep that  the evil must grow desperate before we become conscious of it.
 It seems  to me that bigotry has at least one mortal foe, though.
 You are always  here; you must show them by your life what the Father is THAT is being a  Christian!"    "I know," said Erica, a look of almost passionate longing dawning in her  eyes.
 "Oh! What a thing it is to be crammed full of faults that hinder  one from serving! And all these worries do try one's temper fearfully.
  If they had but a Donovan to live with them now! But, as for me, I can't  do much, except love them.
"    Brian loved her too truly to speak words of praise and commendation at  such a time.
    "Is not the love the crux of the whole?" he said quietly.
    "I suppose it is," said Erica, pushing back her hair from her forehead  in the way she always did when anything perplexed her.
 "But just at  present my life is a sort of fugue on Browning's line         'How very hard it is to be a Christian?'    Sometimes I can't help laughing to think that there was a time when I  thought the teaching of Christ unpractical! Do you mind ringing the bell  for me; the others will be in directly, and will be glad of tea after  that headachy place.
"    "Is there nothing else I can do for you?" asked Brian.
    "Yes, one thing more help me to remember the levers of the second order.
  It's my physiology class tonight, and I feel, as Tom would express it,  like a 'boiled owl.
'"    "Let me take the class for you.
"    "Oh, no, thank you," she replied.
 "I wouldn't miss it for the world.
"    It was not till Brian had left that Erica, taking up the article on  cremation, was struck by some resemblance in the handwriting.
 She must  have seen Brian's writing before, but only this afternoon did she make  that fresh discovery.
 Crossing the room she took from one of the book  shelves a dark blue morocco volume, and compared the writing on the fly  leaf with her MS.
    "From another admirer of 'Hiawatha.
'" There could be no doubt that Brian  had written that.
 Had he cared for her so long? Had he indeed loved her  all these years? She was interrupted by the maid bringing in the tea.
    "Mr. Bircham's boy is here, miss, and if you please, can cook speak to  you a minute?"    Erica put down the Longfellow and rolled up "Cremation.
"    "I'm sure she's going to give warning!" she thought to herself.
 "What a  day to choose for it! That's what I call an anti-climax.
"    Her forebodings proved all too true.
 In a minute more in walked the  cook, with the sort of conscious dignity of bearing which means "I am no  longer in your service.
"    "If you please, miss, I wish to leave this day month.
"    "I shall be sorry to lose you," said Erica; "what are your reasons for  leaving?"    "I've not been used, miss, to families as is in the law courts.
 I've  been used to the best West End private families.
"    "I don't see how it can affect you," said Erica, feeling, in spite of  her annoyance, much inclined to laugh.
    "Indeed, miss, and it do.
 There's not a tradesman's boy but has his joke  or his word about Mr. Raeburn," said the cook in an injured voice.
 "And  last Sunday when I went to the minister to show my lines, he said a  member ought to be ashamed to take service with a hatheist and that I  was in an 'ouse of 'ell.
 Those was his very words, miss, an 'ouse of  'ell, he said.
"    "Then it was exceedingly impertinent of him," said Erica, "for he knew  nothing whatever about it.
"    After that there was nothing for it but to accept the resignation, and  to begin once more the weary search for that rara avis, "a good plain  cook.
"    Her interview had only just ended when she heard the front door open.
  She listened intently, but apparently it was only Tom; he came upstairs  singing a refrain with which just then she quite agreed:         "LAW, law Rhymes very well with jaw,       If you're fond of litigation,       And sweet procrastination,       Latin and botheration,       I advise you to go to law.
"    "Halloo!" he exclaimed.
 "So you did get home all right? I like your way  of acting Casabianca! The chieftain sent me tearing out after you, and  when I got there, you had vanished!"    "Brian came up just then," said Erica, "and I thought it better not to  wait.
 Oh, here comes father.
"    Raeburn entered as she spoke.
 No one who saw him would have guessed that  he was an overworked, overworried man, for his face was a singularly  peaceful one, serene with the serenity of a strong nature convinced of  its own integrity.
    "Got some tea for us, Eric?" he asked, throwing himself back in a chair  beside the fire.
    Some shade of trouble in her face, invisible to any eye but that of a  parent, made him watch her intently, while a new hope which made his  heart beat more quickly sprang up within him.
 Christians had not shown  up well that day; prosecuting and persecuting Christians are the most  repulsive beings on earth! Did she begin to feel a flaw in the system  she had professed belief in? Might she by this injustice come to realize  that she had unconsciously cheated herself into a belief? If such things  might win her back to him, might bridge over that miserable gulf between  them, then welcome any trouble, any persecution, welcome even ruin  itself.
    But had he been able to see into Erica's heart, he would have learned  that the grief which had left its traces on her face was the grief of  knowing that such days as these strengthened and confirmed him in his  atheism.
 Erica was indeed ever confronted with one of the most  baffling of all baffling mysteries.
 How was it that a man of such grand  capacities, a man with so many noble qualities, yet remained in the  darkness? One day she put that question sadly enough to Charles Osmond.
    "Not darkness, child, none of your honest secularists who live up to  their creed are in darkness," he replied.
 "However mistakenly, they do  try to promote what they consider the general good.
 Were you in such  absolute blackness before last summer?"    "There was the love of Humanity," said Erica musingly.
    "Yes, and what is that but a ray of the light of life promised to all  who, to any extent, follow Christ? It is only the absolutely selfish who  are in the black shadow.
 The honest atheist is in the penumbra, and  in his twilight sees a little bit of the true sun, though he calls it  Humanity instead of Christ.
"    "Oh, if the shadows would but go!" exclaimed Erica.
    "Would!" he said, laughing gently.
 "Why, child, they will, they must!"    "But now, I mean! 'Here down,' as Mazzini would have said.
"    "You were ever an impatient little mortal.
"    "How can one help being impatient for this," she said with a quick sigh.
    "That is what I used to say myself seven years ago over you," he said  smiling.
 "But I learned that the Father knew best, and that if we would  work with Him we must wait with Him too.
 You musn't waste your strength  in impatience, child, you need every bit of it for the life before you.
"    But patience did not come by nature to a Raeburn, and Erica did not gain  it in a day even by grace.
        .
 Fiesole         And yet, because I love thee, I obtain       From that same love this vindicating grace,       To live on still in love, and yet in vain,       To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.
  E.
 B.
 Browning.
    Much has been said and written about the monotony of unalloyed pleasure,  and the necessity of shadows and dark places in life as well as in  pictured landscape.
 And certainly there can be but few in this world of  stern realities who would dispute the fact that pleasure is doubled by  its contrast with preceding pain.
 Perhaps it was the vividness of this  contrast that made Raeburn and Erica enjoy, with a perfect rapture of  enjoyment, a beautiful view and a beautiful spring day in Italy.
 Behind  them lay a very sombre past; they had escaped for a brief moment from  the atmosphere of strife, from the world of controversy, from the  scorching breath of slander, from the baleful influences of persecution  and injustice.
 Before them lay the fairest of all the cities of Italy.
  They were sitting in the Boboli gardens, and from wooded heights looked  down upon that loveliest of Italian valleys.
    The silver Arno wound its way between the green encircling hills; then  between the old houses of Florence, its waters spanned now by a  light suspension bridge token of modern times now by old brown arches  strengthened and restored, now by the most venerable looking of all the  bridges, the Ponte Vecchio, with its double row of little shops.
 Into  the cloudless blue sky rose the pinnacles of Santa Croce, the domes of  San Spirito, of the Baptistery, of the Cathedral; sharply defined in  the clear atmosphere were the airy, light Campanile of Giotto, the more  slender brown tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, the spire of Santa Maria  Novella.
 Northward beyond the city rose the heights of Fiesole, and to  the east the green hills dotted all over with white houses, swept away  into the unseen distance.
    Raeburn had been selected as the English delegate to attend a certain  political gathering held that year at Florence.
 He had at first  hesitated to accept the post for his work at home had enormously  increased; but the long months of wearing anxiety had so told upon him  that his friends had at length persuaded him to go, fully aware that the  only chance of inducing him to take any rest was to get him out of the  region of work.
    The "Miracles" trial was at length over, but Mr. Pogson had not obtained  the desire of his heart, namely, the imprisonment and fining of Luke  Raeburn.
 The only results of the trial were the extensive advertisement  of the pamphlet in question, a great increase of bitterness on each  side, and a great waste of money.
 Erica's sole consolation lay in the  fact that a few of the more liberal thinkers were beginning to see  the evil and to agitate for a repeal of the Blasphemy Laws.
 As for the  action for libel, there was no chance of its coming on before June, and  in the meantime Mr. Pogson's letter was obtaining a wider circulation,  and perhaps, on the whole, Luke Raeburn was just at that time the  best-abused man in all England.
    There had been a long silence between the father and daughter who  understood each other far too well to need many words at such a time;  but at length a sudden ejaculation from Raeburn made Erica turn her eye  from Fiesole to the shady walk in the garden down which he was looking.
    "Does any Italian walk at such a pace?" he exclaimed.
 "That must surely  be Brian Osmond or his double in the shape of an English tourist.
"    "Oh, impossible!" said Erica, coloring a little and looking intently at  the pedestrian who was still at some little distance.
    "But it is," said Raeburn "height, way of walking, everything! My dear  Eric, don't tell me I can't recognize the man who saved my life.
 I  should know him a mile off!"    "What can have brought him here?" said Erica, a certain joyous tumult  in her heart checked by the dread of evil tidings a dread which was but  natural to one who had lived her life.
    "Come and meet him," said Raeburn.
 "Ha, Brian, I recognized you ever so  far off, and couldn't persuade this child of your identity.
"    Brian, a little flushed with quick walking, looked into Erica's face  searchingly, and was satisfied with what he read there satisfied with  the soft glow of color that came to her cheeks, and with the bright look  of happiness that came into her eyes which, as a rule, were grave, and  when in repose even sad in expression.
    "I owe this to a most considerate patient who thought fit to be taken  ill at Genoa and to telegraph for me," he said in explanation; "and  being in Italy, I thought I might as well take my yearly outing now.
"    "Capital idea!" said Raeburn.
 "You are the very man we wanted.
 What with  the meetings and interviews, I don't get much peace even here, and Erica  is much in need of an escort sometimes.
 How did you find us?"    "They told me at the hotel that I should probably find you here, though,  if I had known what a wilderness of a place it is I should have been  rather hopeless.
"    Erica left most of the talking to her father; just then she felt no  wish to put a single thought into words.
 She wanted only to enjoy the  blissful dream-like happiness which was so new, and rare, and wonderful  that it brought with it the feeling that any very definite thought or  word must bring it to an end.
 Perfect harmony with your surroundings.
  Yes, that was indeed a very true definition of happiness; and of late  the surroundings had been so grim and stormy.
 She seemed to tread upon  air as they roamed about the lovely walks.
 The long, green vistas were  to her a veritable paradise.
 Her father looked so happy, too, and had so  entirely shaken off his cares, and Brian, who was usually rather silent,  seemed today a perfect fountain of talk.
    Since that December day in Westminster Hall a great change had come  over Erica.
 Not a soul besides Brian and herself knew anything about the  scene with Sir Algernon Wyte.
 Not a word had passed between them since  upon the subject; but perhaps because of the silence, that day was  all the more in the thoughts of each.
 The revelation of Brian's  love revealed also to Erica much in his character which had hitherto  perplexed her simply because she had not seen it in the true light.
  There had always been about him a wistfulness bordering on sadness which  had sometimes almost angered her.
 For so little do even intimate  friends know each other, that lives, which seem all peaceful and full of  everything calculated to bring happiness, are often the ones which are  preyed upon by some grievous trouble or anxiety unknown to any outsider.
  If he had indeed loved her all those seven years he must have suffered  fearfully.
 What the suffering had been Erica could, from her present  position, understand well enough.
 The thought of it touched her  inexpressibly, seemed to her, as indeed it was, the shadow of that  Divine Love which had loved her eternally had waited for her through  long years had served her and shielded her, though she never recognized  its existence till at length, in one flash of light, the revelation had  come to her, and she had learned the glory of Love, the murky gloom of  those past misunderstandings.
    Those were wonderful days that they spent together at Florence, the sort  of days that come but once in a life time; for the joy of dawn is quite  distinct from the bright noon day or the calm evening, distinct, too,  from that second and grander dawn which awaits us in the Unseen when the  night of life is over.
 Together they wandered through the long corridors  of the Uffizzi; together they returned again and again to the Tribune,  or traversed that interminable passage across the river which leads to  the Pitti Gallery, or roamed about among the old squares and palaces  which are haunted by so many memories.
 And every day Brian meant to  speak, but could not because the peace, and restfulness, and glamour of  the present was so perfect, and perhaps because, unconsciously, he felt  that these were "halcyon days.
"    On Sunday he made up his mind that he certainly would speak before the  day was over.
 He went with Erica to see the old monastery of San Marco  before morning service at the English church.
 But, though they were  alone together, he could not bring himself to speak there.
 They  wandered from cell to cell, looking at those wonderful frescoes of the  Crucifixion in each of which Fra Angelico seemed to gain some fresh  thought, some new view of his inexhaustible subject.
 And Brian, watching  Erica, thought how that old master would have delighted in the pure face  and perfect coloring, in the short auburn hair which was in itself a  halo, but could not somehow just then draw her thoughts away from the  frescoes.
 Together they stood in the little cells occupied once by  Savonarola; looked at the strange, stern face which Bastianini chiseled  so effectively; stood by the old wooden desk where Savonarola had  written and read, saying very little to one another, but each conscious  that the silence was one of perfect understanding and sympathy.
 Then  came the service in a hideous church, which yet seemed beautiful to  them, with indifferent singing, which was somehow sweeter to them than  the singing of a trained choir elsewhere.
    But, on returning to the hotel, Brian found that his chances for that  day were over for all the afternoon Erica had to receive a constant  succession of visitors who, as she said, turned her father for the time  being into the "British lion.
" In the evening, too, when they walked in  the Cascine, they were no longer alone.
 Raeburn went with then, and as  they paced along the broad avenue with the Arno gleaming through the  fresh green of the trees, talking of the discussions of the past week,  he inadvertently touched the note of pain in an otherwise cloudless day.
    "The work is practically over now," he said.
 "But I think I must take  a day or two to see a little of Florence.
 I must be at Salsburg to  meet Hasenbalg by Wednesday week.
 Can you be ready to leave here on  Wednesday, Eric?"    "Oh, yes, father," she said without hesitation or comment but with  something in her voice which told Brian that she, too, felt a pang of  regret at the thought that their days in that city of golden dreams were  so soon to be ended.
    The Monday morning, however, proved so perfect a day that it dispelled  the shadow that had fallen on them.
 Raeburn wished to go to Fiesole, and  early in the morning Brian, having secured a carriage and settled the  terms with the crafty-looking Italian driver, they set off together.
  The sunny streets looked sunnier than ever; the Tornabuoni was as  usual lively and bustling; the flower market at the base of the Palazza  Strozzi was gay with pinks and carnations and early roses.
 They drove  out of the city, passed innumerable villas, out into the open country  where the only blot upon the fair landscape was a funeral train, the  coffin borne by those gruesome beings, the Brothers of the Misericordia,  with their black robes and black face cloths pierced only with holes for  the eyes.
    "Is it necessary to make death so repulsive?" said Raeburn.
 "Our own  black hearses are bad enough, but upon my word, I should be sorry to be  carried to my grave by such grim beings!"    He took off his hat, however, as they passed, and that not merely out of  deference to the custom of the country but because of the deep reverence  with which he invariably regarded the dead a reverence which in his own  country was marked by the involuntary softening of his voice when he  alluded to the death of others, the token of a nature which, though  strangely twisted, was in truth deeply reverential.
    Then began the long ascent, the road, as usual, being lined with beggars  who importunately followed the carriage; while, no sooner had they  reached the village itself than they were besieged by at least a dozen  women selling the straw baskets which are the specialty of Fiesole.
    "Ecco, signor! Ecco signorina! Vary sheep! Vary sheep!" resounded on  all sides, each vendor thrusting her wares forward so that progress was  impossible.
    "What a plague this is!" said Raeburn.
 "They'll never leave you in  peace, Erica; they are too well used to the soft hearted signorina  Inglese.
"    "Well, then, I shall leave you to settle them," said Erica, laughing,  "and see if I can't sketch a little in the amphitheatre.
 They can't  torment us there because there is an entrance fee.
"    "All right, and I will try this bird's eye view of Florence," said  Raeburn, establishing himself upon the seat which stands on the verge  of the hill looking southward.
 He was very fond of making pen-and-ink  sketches, and by his determined, though perfectly courteous manner, he  at last succeeded in dismissing the basket women.
    Erica and Brian, in the meantime, walked down the steep little path  which leads back to the village, on their way encountering a second  procession of Brothers bearing a coffin.
 In a few minutes they had found  their way to a quiet garden at the remote end of which, far from the  houses of Fiesole and sheltered on all sides by the green Apennines, was  an old Roman amphitheatre.
 Grass and flowers had sprung up now on the  arena where in olden times had been fearful struggles between men and  beasts.
 Wild roses and honeysuckle drooped over the gray old building,  and in between the great blocks of stone which formed the tiers of seats  for the spectators sprung the yellow celandine and the white star of  Bethlehem.
    Erica sat down upon one of the stony seats and began to sketch the  outline of the hills and roughly to draw in the foreground the further  side of the amphitheatre and broken column which lay in the middle.
    "Would you mind fetching me some water?" she said to Brian.
    There was a little trickling stream close by, half hidden by bramble  bushes.
 Brian filled her glass and watched her brush as she washed in  the sky.
    "Is that too blue, do you think?" she asked, glancing up at him with one  of her bright looks.
    "Nothing could be too deep for such a sky as this," he replied, half  absently.
 Then, with a sudden change of tone, "Erica, do you remember  the first day you spoke to me?"    "Under murky London skies very unlike these," she said, laughing a  little, but nervously.
 "You mean the day when our umbrellas collided!"    "You mustn't abuse the murky skies," said Brian, smiling.
 "If the sun  had been shining, the collision would never have occurred.
 Oh, Erica!  What a life time it seems since that day in Gower Street! I little  thought then that I should have to wait more than seven years to  tell you of my love, or that at last I should tell you in a Roman  amphitheatre under these blue skies.
 Erica, I think you have known it of  late.
 Have you, my darling? Have you known how I loved you?"    "Yes," she said, looking down at her sketch book with glowing cheeks.
    "Oh! If you knew what a paradise of hope you opened to me that day last  December and how different life has been ever since! Those were gray  years, Erica, when I dared not even hope to gain your love.
 But lately,  darling, I have hoped.
 Was I wrong?"    "No," she said with a little quiver in her voice.
    "You will love me?"    She looked up at him for a moment in silence, a glorious light in her  eyes, her whole face radiant with joy.
    "I do love you," she said softly.
    He drew nearer to her, held both her hands in his, waiting only for the  promise which would make her indeed his own.
    "Will you be my wife, darling?"    But the words had scarcely passed his lips when a look of anguish swept  over Erica's face; she snatched away her hands.
    "Oh! God help me!" she cried.
 "What have I done? I've been living in a  dream! It's impossible, Brian! Impossible!"    A gray look came over Brian's face.
    "How impossible?" he asked in a choked voice.
    "I can't leave home," she said, clasping her hands tightly together.
 "I  never can leave my father.
"    "I will wait," said Brian, recovering his voice.
 "I will wait any time  for you only give me hope.
"    "I can't," she sobbed.
 "I daren't!"    "But you have given it me!" he exclaimed.
 "You have said you loved me!"    "I do! I do!" she cried passionately.
 "But, oh, Brian! Have pity on me  don't make me say it again I must not think of it I can never be your  wife.
"    Her words were broken with sobs which she could not restrain.
    "My darling," he said growing calm and strong again at the sight of her  agitation, and once more possessing himself of her hand, "you have had a  great many troubles lately, and I can quite understand that just now you  could not leave your father.
 But I will wait till less troubled times;  then surely you will come to me?"    "No," she said quickly as if not daring to pause, "It will always be the  same; there never will be quiet times for us.
 I can't leave my father.
  It isn't as if he had other children I am the only one, and must stay.
"    "Is this then to be the end of it all?" cried Brian.
 "My darling, you  can not be so cruel to me.
 It can not be the end there is no end to love  and we know that we love each other.
 Erica, give me some future to look  to some hope.
"    The terrible pain expressed in every line of his face wrung her heart.
    "Oh, wait," she exclaimed.
 "Give me one moment to think.
"    She buried her face in her hands, shutting out the sunny Italian  landscape, the very beauty of which seemed to weaken her powers of  endurance.
 Truly she had been living lately in a golden dream, and the  waking was anguish.
 Oh, if she had but realized before the meaning of  it all, then she would have hidden her love so that he never would have  guessed it.
 She would have been to him the Erica of a year ago, just a  friend and nothing more.
 But now she must give him the worst of pain,  perhaps ruin his whole life.
 If she might but give him some promise.
  What was the right? How were love and duty to be reconciled?    As she sat crouched up in her misery, fighting the hardest battle of her  life, the bell in the campanile of the village church began to ring.
  It was twelve o'clock.
 All through the land, in remembrance of the hour  when the true meaning of love and sacrifice was revealed to the human  race, there swept now the music of church bells, bidding the people to  pause in their work and pray.
 Many a peasant raised his thoughts for a  moment from sordid cares or hard labor, and realized that there was an  unseen world.
 And here in the Roman amphitheatre, where a conflict more  painful than those physical conflicts of old time was going on, a soul  prayed in agony for the wisdom to see the right and the strength to do  it.
    When at length Erica lifted her face she found that Brian was no longer  beside her, he was pacing to and fro in the arena; waiting had grown  unbearable to him.
 She went down to him, moving neither quickly nor  hurriedly, but at the steady "right onward" pace which suited her whole  aspect.
    "Brian," she said in a low voice, "do you remember telling me that day  that I must try to show them what the Father is? You must help me now,  not hinder.
 You will help me just because you do indeed love me?"    "You will give me no promise even for the most distant future?"    "I can't," she replied, faltering a little as she saw him turn deadly  white.
 "If there were any engagement between us, I should have to tell  my father of it; and that would only make our trouble his and defeat my  whole object.
 Oh, Brian, forgive me, and just leave me.
 I can have given  you nothing but pain all these years.
 Don't let me spoil your whole  life!"    His face caught something of the noble purpose which made hers shine in  spite of the sadness.
    "Darling," he said quickly, "I can thank God for you though you are  never to be mine.
 God bless you, Erica.
"    There was a moment's pause; he still kept her hands in his.
    "Tell your father I've gone for a walk over to those hills that I shall  not be home till evening.
" He felt her hands tremble, and knew that he  only tortured her by staying.
 "Will you kiss me once, Erica?" he said.
    She lifted a pale steadfast face and quivering lips to his, and after  that one long embrace they parted.
 When he turned away Erica stood quite  still for a minute in the arena listening to his retreating footsteps.
  Her heart, which had throbbed painfully, seemed now only to echo his  steps, to beat more faintly as they grew less audible.
 At last came  silence, and then she crept up to the place where she had left her  sketch book and paint box.
    The whole world seemed sliding away aching desolation overwhelmed her.
  Brian's face with its passion and pain rose before her dry, burning  eyes.
 Then darkness came, blotting out the sunshine; the little stream  trickling into its stony basin seemed to grow into a roaring cataract,  the waters to rush into her ears with a horrid gurgling; while the  stones of the amphitheatre seemed to change into blocks of ice and to  freeze her as she lay.
    A few minutes later she gasped her way painfully back to life.
 All was  very peaceful now; the water fell with its soft tinkling sound, there  was a low hum of insects; beside her stony pillow grew some stars of  Bethlehem, and in between their delicate white and green she could see  the arena and the tiers of seats opposite, and out beyond the green  encircling hills.
 Golden sunshine lighted up the dark pines and  spirelike cypresses; in the distance there was an olive garden, its  soft, gray-green foliage touched into silvery brightness.
    The beauty of the scene, which in her struggle had seemed to weaken and  unnerve her, stole now into her heart and comforted her; and all the  time there rang in her ears the message that the bells had brought her  "Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross.
"    "Taking a siesta?" said a voice above her.
 She looked up and saw her  father.
    "I've rather a headache," she replied.
    "Enough to give you one, my child, to lie there in the sun without  an umbrella," he said, putting up his own to shelter her.
 "Such a  May noonday in Italy might give you a sunstroke.
 What was your doctor  thinking of to allow it?"    "Brian? Oh, he has gone over to those hills; we are not to wait for him,  he wanted a walk.
"    "Quite right," said Raeburn.
 "I don't think he ought to waste his  holiday in Italian cities, he wants fresh air and exercise after his  London life.
 Where's your handkerchief?"    He took it to the little stream, put aside the overhanging bushes,  dipped it in the water, and bringing it back laid it on her burning  forehead.
    "How you spoil me, PADRE MIO," she said with a little laugh that was  sadder than tears; and as she spoke she slipped down to a lower step  and rested her head on his knee, drawing down one of his strong hands to  shade her eyes.
 He talked of his sketch, of his word-skirmish with the  basket women, of the view from the amphitheatre; but she did not much  hear what he said, she was looking at the hand that shaded her eyes.
  That strong hand which had toiled for her when she was a helpless baby,  the hand to which she had clung when every out her support had been  wrenched away by death, the hand which she had held in hers when she  thought he was dying, and the children had sung of "Life's long day and  death's dark night.
"    All at once she drew it down and pressed it to her lips with a child's  loving reverence.
 Then she sat up with a sudden return of energy.
    "There, now, let us go home," she exclaimed.
 "My head aches a little  still, but we won't let it spoil our last day but one in Florence.
  Didn't we talk of San Miniato for this afternoon?"    It was something of a relief to find, on returning, an invitation to  dinner for that evening which Raeburn could not well refuse.
 Erica kept  up bravely through the afternoon, but when she was once more alone her  physical powers gave way.
 She was lying on her bed sick and faint and  weary, and with the peculiarly desolate feeling which comes to most  people when they are ill in a hotel with all the unheeding bustle going  on around them.
 Then came a knock at her door.
    "Entrate," she said quickly, welcoming any fresh voice which would  divert her mind from the weary longing for her mother.
 A sort of wild  hope sprung up within her that some woman friend would be sent to her,  that Gladys Farrant, or old Mrs. Osmond, or her secularist friend Mrs.  MacNaughton, whom she loved best of all, would suddenly find themselves  in Florence and come to her in her need.
    There entered a tall, overworked waiter.
 He looked first at her, then at  the note in his hand, spelling out the direction with a puzzled face.
    "Mess Rabi Rabi Rabi Rabi an?" he asked hesitatingly.
    "Grazie," she replied, almost snatching it from him.
 The color rushed  to her cheeks as she saw the writing was Brian's, and the instant the  waiter had closed the door she tore open the envelope with trembling  hands.
    It was a last appeal, written after he had returned from wandering among  the Apennines, worn out in body and shaken from the noble fortitude of  the morning.
 The strong passionate words woke an answering thrill in  Erica's heart.
 He asked her to think it all over once more, he had gone  away too hastily.
 If she could change her mind, could see any possible  hope for the future, would she write to him? If he heard nothing from  her, he would understand what the silence meant.
 This was in brief the  substance of the letter, but the words had a passionate, unrestrained  intensity which showed they had been written by a man of strong nature  overwrought by suffering and excitement.
    He was here, in the very hotel.
 Might she not write to him? Might she  not send him some sort of message write just a word of indefinite hope  which would comfort and relieve herself as well as him? "If I do not  hear from you, I shall understand what your silence means.
" Ah! But  would he understand? What had she said this morning to him? Scarcely  anything the merest broken bits of sentences, the poorest, coldest  confession of love.
    Her writing case lay open on the table beside the bed with an unfinished  letter to Aunt Jean, begun before they had started for Fiesole.
 She  snatched up paper and pen, and trembling so much that she could scarcely  support herself she wrote two brief lines.
    "Darling, I love you, and always must love you, first and best.
"    Then she lay back again exhausted, looking at the poor little weak words  which would not contain a thousandth part of the love in heart.
 Yet,  though the words were true, would they perhaps convey a wrong meaning  to him? Ought she to send them? On the other hand would he indeed  understand the silence the silence which seemed now intolerable to her?  She folded the note and directed it, the tumult in her heart growing  wilder as she did so.
 Once more there raged the battle which she had  fought in the amphitheatre that morning, and she was not so strong now;  she was weakened by physical pain, and to endure was far harder.
 It  seemed to her that her whole life would be unbearable if she did not  send him that message.
 And to send it was so fatally easy; she had  merely to ring, and then in a few minutes the note would be in his  hands.
    It was a little narrow slip of a room; all her life long she could  vividly recall it.
 The single bed pushed close to the wall, the writing  table with its gay-patterned cloth, the hanging wardrobe with glass  doors, the walls trellised with roses, and on the ceiling a painting of  some white swans eternally swimming in an ultra-marine lake.
 The window,  unshuttered, but veiled by muslin curtains, looked out upon the Arno;  from her bed she could see the lights on the further bank.
 On the wall  close beside her was a little round wooden projection.
 If it had been a  rattlesnake she could not have gazed at it more fixedly.
 Then she looked  at the printed card above, and the words written in French and English,  German, and Italian, seemed to fall mechanically on her brain, though  burning thoughts seethed there, too.
    "Ring once for hot water, twice for the chamber maid, three times for  the waiter.
"    Merely to touch that ivory knob, and then by the lightest pressure of  the finger tips a whole world of love and happiness and rest might open  for her, and life would be changed forever.
    Again and again she was on the point of yielding, but each time she  resisted, and each resistance made her stronger.
 At length, with a  fearful effort, she turned her face away and buried it in the pillow,  clinging with all her might to the ironwork of the bed.
    For at least an hour the most frightful hour of her life she did not  dare to stir.
 At last when her hands were stiff and sore with that rigid  grasping, when it seemed as if her heart had been wrenched out of  her and had left nothing but an aching void, she sat up and tore both  Brian's note and her reply into a thousand pieces; then, in a weary,  lifeless way, made her preparations for the night.
    But sleep was impossible.
 The struggle was over forever, but the pain  was but just begun, and she was still a young girl with the best part of  her life stretching out before her.
 She did not toss about restlessly,  but lay very still, just enduring her misery, while all the every-day  sounds came to her from without laughter in the next room from two  talkative American girls, doors opening and shutting, boots thrown down,  electric bells rung, presently her father's step and voice.
    "Has Miss Raeburn been up long?"    "Sairtenlee, sair, yes," replied the English-speaking waiter.
 "The  signorina sleeps, doubtless.
"    Then came a pause, and in another minute her father's door was closed  and locked.
    Noisy parties of men shouting out some chorus sung at one of the  theatres passed along the Lung' Arno, and twanging mandolins wandered up  and down in the moonlight.
 The sound of that harshest and most jarring  of all musical instruments was every after hateful to her.
 She could not  hear one played without a shudder.
    Slowly and wearily the night wore on.
 Sometimes she stole to the window,  and looked out on the sleeping city, on the peaceful Arno which was  bathed in silvery moonlight, and on the old, irregular houses, thinking  what struggles and agonies this place had witnessed in past times, and  realizing what an infinitesimal bit of the world's sufferings she was  called to bear.
 Sometimes she lighted a candle and read, sometimes  prayed, but for the most part just lay still, silently enduring,  learning, though she did not think it, the true meaning of pain.
    Somewhat later than usual she joined her father the next morning in the  coffee room.
    "Brian tells me he is off today," was Raeburn's greeting.
 "It seems that  he must see that patient at Genoa again, and he wants to get a clear  fortnight in Switzerland.
"    "Is it nor rather early for Switzerland?"    "I should have thought so, but he knows more about it than I do.
 He has  written to try to persuade your friend, Mr. Farrant, to join him in the  Whitsuntide recess.
"    "Oh, I am glad of that," said Erica, greatly relieved.
    Directly after breakfast she went out with her father, going first of  all to French's bank, where Raeburn had to change a circular note.
    "It is upstairs," he said as they reached the house.
 "Don't you trouble  to come up; you'll have stairs enough presently at the Uffizzi.
"    "Very well," she replied, "I will wait for you here.
"    She stood in the doorway looking out thoughtfully at the busy Tornabuoni  and its gay shops; but in a minute a step she knew sounded on the  staircase, and the color rushed to her cheeks.
    "I have just said goodbye to your father," said Brian.
 "I am leaving  Florence this morning.
 You must forgive me for having written last  night.
 I ought not to have done it, and I understood your silence.
"    He spoke calmly, in the repressed voice of a man who holds "passion in  a leash.
" Erica was thankful to have the last sight of him thus calm and  strong and self-restrained.
 It was a nobler side of love than that which  had inspired his letter nobler because freer from thought of self.
    "I am so glad you will have Donovan," she said.
 "Goodbye.
"    He took her hand in his, pressed it, and turned away without a word.
        .
 "Right Onward"         Therefore my Hope arose       From out her swound and gazed upon Thy face.
       And, meeting there that soft subduing look       Which Peter's spirit shook       Sunk downward in a rapture to embrace       Thy pierced hands and feet with kisses close,       And prayed Thee to assist her evermore       To "reach the things before.
"  E.
 B.
 Browning    "I'm really thankful it is the last time I shall have to get this  abominable paper money," said Raeburn, coming down the stairs.
 "Just  count these twos and fives for me, dear; fifteen of each there should  be.
"    At that moment Brian had just passed the tall, white column disappearing  into the street which leads to the Borgo Ogni Santi.
 Erica turned to  begin her new chapter of life heavily handicapped in the race for once  more that deadly faintness crept over her, a numbing, stifling pressure,  as if Pain in physical form had seized her heart in his cold clasp.
 But  with all her strength she fought against it, forcing herself to count  the hateful little bits of paper, and thankful that her father was too  much taken up with the arrangement of his purse to notice her.
    "I am glad we happened to meet Brian," he remarked; "he goes by an  earlier train that I thought.
 Now, little son Eric, where shall we go?  We'll have a day of unmitigated pleasure and throw care to the winds.
  I'll even forswear Vieusseux; there won't be much news today.
"    "Let us take the Pitti Palace first," said Erica, knowing that the fresh  air and the walk would be the only chance for her.
    She walked very quickly with the feeling that, if she were still for a  single moment, she should fall down.
 And, luckily, Raeburn thought her  paleness accounted for by yesterday's headache and the wakeful night,  and never suspected the true state of the case.
 On they went, past  fascinating marble shops and jewelers' windows filled with Florentine  mosaics, across the Ponte Vecchio, down a shady street, and into the  rough-hewn, grim-looking palace.
 It was to Erica like a dream of pain,  the surroundings were so lovely, the sunshine so perfect, and her own  heart so sore.
    But within that old palace she found the true cure for sore hearts.
 She  remembered having looked with Brian at an "Ecce Home," by Carlo Dolci  and thought she would like to see it again.
 It was not a picture her  father would have cared for, and she left him looking at Raphael's  "Three Ages of Man," and went by herself into the little room which is  called the "Hall of Ulysses.
" The picture was a small one and had what  are considered the usual faults of the painter, but it was the  first "Ecce Homo" that Erica had ever cared for; and, whatever the  shortcomings of the execution, the ideal was a most beautiful one.
  The traces of physical pain were not brought into undue prominence,  appearing not at all in the face, which was full of unutterable calm  and dignity.
 The deep, brown eyes had the strange power which belongs to  some pictures; they followed you all over the room there was no escaping  them.
 They were hauntingly sad eyes, eyes in which there lurked grief  unspeakable; not the grief which attends bodily pain, but the grief  which grieves for others the grief which grieves for humanity, for  its thousand ills and ignorances, its doubts and denials, its sins  and sufferings.
 There was no bitterness in it, no restlessness, no  questioning.
 It was the grief of a noble strong man whose heart is torn  by the thought of the sin and misery of his brothers, but who knows that  the Father can, and will, turn the evil into the means of glorious gain.
    As Erica looked, the true meaning of pain seemed to flash upon her.
  Dimly she had apprehended it in the days of her atheism, had clung to  the hope that the pain of the few brought the gain of the many; but now  the hope became certainty, the faith became open vision.
 For was it not  all here, written in clearest characters, in the life of the Ideal Man?  And is not what was true for him, true for us too? We talk much about  "Christ our example," and struggle painfully along the uphill road of  the "Imitation of Christ," meaning by that too often a vague endeavor  to be "good," to be patient, to be not entirely absorbed in the things  which are seen.
 But when pain comes, when the immense misery and evil in  the world are borne in upon us, we too often stumble, or fail utterly,  just because we do not understand our sonship; because we forget that  Christians must be sin-bearers like their Master, pain bearers like  their Master; because we will let ourselves be blinded by the mystery of  evil and the mystery of pain, instead of fixing our eyes as Christ did,  on the joy that those mysteries are sure to bring.
 "Lo, I come to do Thy  will.
" And what is the will of even a good earthly father but the best  possible for all his children?    Erica saw for the first time that no pain she had ever suffered had been  a wasted thing, nor had it merely taught her personally some needful  lesson; it had been rather her allotted service, her share of  pain-bearing, sin-bearing, Christ-following; her opportunity of doing  the "Will" not self-chosen, but given to her as one of the best of gifts  by the Father Himself.
    "Oh, what a little fool I've been!" she thought to herself with the  strange pang of joy which comes when we make some discovery which  sweetens the whole of life, and which seems so self-evident that we can  but wonder and wonder at our dense stupidity in not seeing it sooner.
  "I've been grudging Brian what God sees he most wants! I've been  groaning over the libels and injustices which seem to bring so much pain  and evil when, after all, they will be, in the long run, the very  things to show people the need of tolerance, and to establish freedom of  speech.
"    Even this pain of renunciation seemed to gain a new meaning for her  though she could not in the least fathom it; even the unspeakable  grief of feeling that her father was devoting much of his life to the  propagation of error, lost its bitterness though it retained its depth.
  For with the true realization of Fatherhood and Sonship impatience  and bitterness die, and in their place rises the peace which "passeth  understanding.
"    "We will have a day of unmitigated pleasure," her father had said to  her, and the words had at the time been like a sharp stab.
 But, after  all, might not this pain, this unseen and dimly understood work for  humanity, be in very truth the truest pleasure? What artist is there  who would not gratefully receive from the Master an order to attempt  the loftiest of subjects? What poet is there whose heart would not bound  when he knew he was called to write on the noblest of themes? All the  struggles, all the weary days of failure, all the misery of conscious  incompleteness, all the agony of soul these were but means to the end,  and so inseparably bound up with the end that they were no more evil,  but good, their darkness over flooded with the light of the work  achieved.
    Raeburn, coming into the room, saw what she was looking at, and turned  away.
 Little as he could understand her thoughts, he was not the sort  of man to wound unnecessarily one who differed from him.
 His words in  public were sharp and uncompromising; in debate he did not much care how  he hit as long as he hit hard.
 But, apart from the excitement of  such sword play, he was, when convinced that his hearers were honest  Christians, genuinely sorry to give them pain.
    Erica found him looking at a Sevres china vase in which he could not by  any possibility have been interested.
    "I feel Mr. Ruskin's wrathful eye upon me," she said, laughing.
 "Now  after spending all that time before a Carlo Dolci, we must really go  to the Uffizzi and look at Botticelli's 'Fortitude'.
 Brian and I nearly  quarreled over it the last time we were there.
"    So they wandered away together through the long galleries, Erica  pointing out her favorite pictures and hearing his opinion about them.
  And indeed Raeburn was as good a companion as could be wished for in a  picture gallery.
 The intense development of the critical faculty, which  had really been the bane of his existence, came here to his aid for he  had a quick eye for all that was beautiful both in art and nature, and  wonderfully keen powers of observation.
 The refreshment, too, of leaving  for a moment his life of excessive toil was great; Erica hoped that he  really did find the day, for once, "unmitigated pleasure.
"    They went to Santa Croce, they walked through the crowded market, they  had a merry dispute about ascending the campanile.
    "Just this one you really must let me try," said Erica, "they say it is  very easy.
"    "To people without spines perhaps it may be," said Raeburn.
    "But think of the view from the top," said Erica, "and it really won't  hurt me.
 Now, padre mio, I'm sure it's for the greatest happiness of the  greatest number that I should go up!"    "It's the old story," said Raeburn, smiling,         'Vain is the hope, by any force or skill,       To stem the current of a woman's will;       For if she will, she will, you may depend on't,       And if she won't, she won't, and there's an end on't.
'    However, since this is probably the last time in our lives that we shall  have the chance, perhaps, I'll not do the tyrannical father.
"    They had soon climbed the steep staircase and were quite rewarded by the  magnificent view from the top, a grand panorama of city and river and  green Apennines.
 Erica looked northward to Fiesole with a fast-throbbing  heart.
 Yet it seemed as if half a life time lay between the  passion-tossed yesterday and the sad yet peaceful present.
 Nor was the  feeling a mere delusion; she had indeed in those brief hours lived years  of the spirit life.
    She did not stay long at that northern parapet; thoughts of her own  life or even of Brian's would not do just then.
 She had to think of her  father, to devote herself to him.
 And somehow, though her heart was  sad, yet her happiness was real as they tried together to make out the  various buildings; and her talk was unrestrained, and even her laughter  natural, not forced; for it is possible to those who really love to  throw themselves altogether into the life of another, and to lay aside  all thought of self.
    Once or twice that day she half feared that her father must guess all  that had happened.
 He was so very careful of her, so considerate; and  for Raeburn to be more considerate meant a great deal for in private  he was always the most gentle man imaginable.
 His opponents, who  often regarded him as a sort of "fiend in human shape," were strangely  mistaken in their estimate of his character.
 When treated with  discourtesy or unfairness in public, it was true that he hit back  again, and hit hard; and, since even in the nineteenth century we are  so foolish as to use these weapons against the expression of opinions  we deem mischievous, Raeburn had had a great deal of practice in this  retaliation.
 He was a very proud and a very sensitive man, not blessed  with overmuch patience.
 But he held his opinions honestly and had  suffered much for them; he had a real love for humanity and an almost  passionate desire to better his generation.
 To such a man it was no  light thing to be deemed everything that is vile; like poor Shelley,  he found it exceedingly bitter to let "murderers and traitors take  precedence of him in public opinion.
" People in general took into  account all his harsh utterances (and some of them were very harsh),  but they rarely thought anything about the provocation received, the  excessively hard life that this man had lived, the gross personal  insults which he had had to put up with, the galling injustice he had  had to fight against.
 Upon this side of the question they just turned  their backs, pooh-poohed it, or, when it was forced upon their notice,  said (unanswerable argument!): "It wouldn't be so!"    When, as they were making the descent, Erica found the strong hand  stretched out for hers the moment the way grew dark, when she was warned  of the slightest difficulty by, "Take care, little one, a narrow step,"  or, "'Tis rather broken here," she almost trembled to think that, in  spite of all her efforts, he might have learned how matters really were.
  But by and by his serenity reassured her; had he thought that she was in  trouble his face would not have been so cloudless.
    And in truth Raeburn, spite of his keen observation, never thought for  a moment of the true state of the case.
 He was a very literal  unimaginative man, and having once learned to regard Brian as an old  family friend and as his doctor, he never dreamed of regarding him in  the light of his daughter's lover.
 Also, as is not unfrequently the case  when a man has only one child, he never could take in the fact that  she was quite grown up.
 Even when he read her articles in the "Daily  Review," or discussed the most weighty topics with her, she was always  "little son Eric," or his "little one.
" And Erica's unquenchable high  spirits served to keep up the delusion.
 She would as often as not end  a conversation on Darwinism by a romp with Friskarina, or write a very  thoughtful article on "Scrutin de Liste," and then spring up from her  desk and play like any child with an India-rubber ball nominally kept  for children visitors.
    She managed to tide over those days bravely and even cheerfully for  her father's sake.
 It was easier when they had left Florence with  its overbright and oversad memories.
 Peaceful old Verona was more in  accordance with her state of mind; and from thence they went to Trento,  and over the Brenner, passing Botzen and Brixen in their lovely valley,  gaining a brief glimpse of the spire-like Dolomito, and gradually  ascending the pass, leaving the river and its yellow reeds, and  passing through the rich pasture land where the fields were bright  with buttercups and daisies gold and silver of the people's property  as Raeburn called them.
 Then on once more between crimson and purple  porphyry mountains, nearer and nearer to the snowy mountain peaks; and  at last, as the day drew to an end, they descended again, and saw down  below them in the loveliest of valleys a little town, its white houses  suffused by a crimson sunset glow.
    "Innsbruck, madame, Innsbruck!" said a fat old Tyrolean man who had  been showing them all the beauties of his beloved country throughout the  journey.
    And, though nothing could ever again have for Erica the sweet glamour  of an Italian city, yet she was glad now to have seen the last of that  sunny land, and welcomed the homely little place with its matter-of-fact  houses and prosperous comfort.
 She felt somehow that it would be easier  to endure now that she was fairly out of Italy.
    The day after their arrival at Innsbruck was Sunday.
 There was no  English service as yet for the season had not begun, but Erica went  to the little Lutheran church, and Raeburn, who had never been to  a Lutheran service, went with her for the sake of studying the  congregation, the preacher, and the doctrine.
 Also, perhaps, because he  did not want her to feel lonely in a foreign place.
    All her life long Erica remembered that Sunday.
 The peaceful little  church with its high pews, where they sat to sing and stood to pray, the  homely German pastor with his plain yet forcible sermon on "Das Gebet,":  the restful feeling of unity which so infinitely outweighed all the  trifling differences, and the comfort of the sweet old German chorales.
  The words of one of them lingered always in her memory.
    "Fuhlt Seel und Leib ein Wohl ergehen So treib es mich zum Dank dafur;  Last du mich deine Werke sehen, So sey mein Ruhmen stets von dir; Und  find ich in der Welt nicht Ruh, So steig mein Schmen Hinmel zu.
"    After the service was ended, they wandered out into the public gardens  where birds were singing round the statue of Walter von der Vogelveice,  and a sparrow, to Erica's great delight, perched on his very shoulder.
  Then they left the town altogether and roamed out into the open country,  crossing the river by a long and curiously constructed plank bridge,  and sauntering along the valley beneath the snowy mountains, the river  flowing smoothly onward, the birds singing, and a paradise of flowers on  every side.
 It was quite the hottest day they had had, and they were not  sorry to rest in the first shady place they came to.
    "This is the right way to take pleasure," said Raeburn, enjoying as only  an ardent lover of Nature can enjoy a mountain view.
 "Brief snatches in  between hard work.
 More than that is hardly admissible in such times as  ours.
" His words seemed to them prophetic later on for their pleasure  was destined to be even briefer than they had anticipated.
 The hotel  at which they were staying was being painted, Erica had a room on the  second floor, but Raeburn had been put at the top of the house.
 They had  just returned from a long drive and were quietly sitting in Erica's room  writing letters, thinking every moment that the gong would sound for  the six-o'clock TABLE D'HOTE, when a sound of many voices outside made  Raeburn look up.
 He went to the window.
    "Haloo! A fire engine!" he exclaimed.
    Erica hastily joined him; a crowd was gathering beneath the window,  shouting, waving, gesticulating.
    "Why, they are pointing up here!" cried Erica.
 "The fire must be here!"    She rushed across the room and opened the door; the whole place was in  an uproar, people rushing to and fro, cries of "FEUER! FEUER!" a waiter  with scared face hurrying from room to room with the announcement in  broken English, "The hotel is on fire!" or, sometimes in his haste and  confusion, "The fire is on hotel!" For a moment Erica's heart stood  still; the very vagueness of the terror, the uncertainty as to the  extent of the danger or the possibility of escape, was paralyzing.
 Then  with the natural instinct of a book lover she hastily picked up two or  three volumes from the table and begged her father to come.
 He made her  put on her hat and cloak, and shouldering her portmanteau, led the way  through the corridors and down the staircase, steadily forcing a passage  through the confused and terrified people, and never pausing for an  instant, not even asking the whereabouts of the fire, till he had got  Erica safely out into the little platz and had set down her portmanteau  under one of the trees.
    They looked up then and saw that the whole of the roof and the attics of  the hotel were blazing.
 Raeburn's room was immediately below and was in  great danger.
 A sudden thought seemed to occur to him, a look of dismay  crossed his face, he felt hurriedly in his pocket.
    "Where did I change my coat, Erica?" he asked.
    "You went up to your room to change it just before the drive," she  replied.
    "Then, by all that's unlucky, I've left in it those papers for  Hasenbalg! Wait here; I'll be back in a minute.
"    He hurried off, looking more anxious than Erica had ever seen him look  before.
 The papers which he had been asked to deliver to Herr Hasenbalg  in no way concerned him, but they had been intrusted to his care and  were, therefore, of course more to be considered than the most valuable  private property.
 Much hindered by the crowd and by the fire engine  itself which had been moved into the entrance hall, he at length  succeeded in fighting his way past an unceasing procession of furniture  which was being rescued from the flames, and pushing his way up the  stairs, had almost gained his room when a pitiful cry reached his ears.
  It was impossible to a man of Raeburn's nature not to turn aside; the  political dispatches might be very important, but a deserted child in  a burning house outweighed all other considerations.
 He threw open the  door of the room whence the cry had come; the scaffolding outside had  caught fire, and the flames were darting in at the window.
 Sitting up in  a little wooden cot was a child of two or three years old, his baby face  wild with fright.
    "Poor bairn!" exclaimed Raeburn, taking him in his strong arms.
 "Have  they forgotten you?"    The child was German and did not understand a word, but it knew in a  moment that this man, so like a fairy-tale giant, was a rescuer.
    "Guter Riese!" it sobbed, appealingly.
    The "good giant" snatched a blanket from the cot, rolled it round the  shivering little bit of humanity, and carried him down into the platz.
    "Keep this bairnie till his belongings claim him," he said, putting his  charge into Erica's arms.
 And then he hurried back again, once more  ran the gantlet of the descending wardrobes and bedsteads, and at last  reached his room.
 It was bare of all furniture; the lighter things his  coat among them had been thrown out of the window, the more solid things  had been carried down stairs.
 He stood there baffled and for once in his  life bewildered.
    Half-choked with the smoke, he crossed the room and looked out of the  window, the hot breath of the flames from the scaffolding scorching his  face.
 But looking through that frame of fire, he saw that a cordon had  been drawn round the indiscriminate piles of rescued property, that the  military had been called out, and that the most perfect order prevailed.
  There was still a chance that he might recover the lost papers! Then, as  there was no knowing that the roof would not fall in and crush him, he  made the best of his way down again among the still flowing stream of  furniture.
    An immense crowd had gathered in the square outside; the awe-struck  murmurs and exclamations sounded like the roar of distant thunder, and  the shouts of "WASSER! WASSER!" alternated with the winding of bugles  as the soldiers moved now in one direction, now in another, their bright  uniforms and the shining helmets of the fire brigade men flashing hither  and thither among the dark mass of spectators.
 Overhead the flames raged  while the wind blew down bits of burning tinder upon the crowd.
 Erica,  wedged in among the friendly Tyrolese people, watched anxiously for  her father, not quite able to believe his assurance that there was no  danger.
 When at length she saw the tall commanding figure emerge from  the burning hotel, the white head towering over the crowd, her heart  gave a great bound of relief.
 But she saw in a moment that he had been  unsuccessful.
    "It must have been thrown out of the window," he said, elbowing his way  up to her.
 "The room was quite bare, carpet and all gone, nothing to be  found but these valuables," and with a smile, he held up the last number  of the "Idol-Breaker," and a tooth brush.
    "They are taking great care of the things," said Erica.
 "Perhaps we  shall find it by and by.
"    "We must find it," said Raeburn, his lips forming into the curve of  resoluteness which they were wont to assume when any difficulty arose to  be grappled with.
 "What has become of the bairn?"    "A nurse came up and claimed it and was overwhelmingly grateful to you  for your rescue.
 She had put the child to bed early and had gone for a  walk in the gardens.
 Oh, look, how the fire is spreading!"    "The scaffolding is terribly against saving it, and the wind is high,  too," said Raeburn, scanning the place all over with his keen eyes.
  Then, as an idea seemed to strike him, he suddenly hurried forward once  more, and Erica saw him speaking to two fire brigade men.
 In another  minute the soldiers motioned the crowd further back, Raeburn rejoined  Erica, and, picking up her portmanteau, took her across the road to the  steps of a neighboring hotel.
 "I've suggested that they should cut down  the scaffolding," he said; "it is the only chance of saving the place.
"    The whole of the woodwork was now on fire; to cut it down was a somewhat  dangerous task, but the men worked gallantly, and in a few minutes  the huge blazing frame, with its poles and cross poles, ladders and  platforms, swayed, quivered, then fell forward with a crash into the  garden beyond.
    Raeburn had, as usual, attracted to himself the persons most worth  talking to in the crowd, a shrewd-looking inhabitant of Innsbruck,  spectacled and somewhat sallow, but with a face which was full of  intellect.
 He learned that, although no one could speak positively as  to the origin of the fire, it was more than probable that it had been no  mere accident.
 The very Sunday before, at exactly the same hour, a large  factory had been entirely destroyed by fire, and it needed no very  deep thinker to discover that a Sunday evening, when every one would  be out-of-doors keeping holiday, and the fire brigade men scattered and  hard to summon, was the very time for incendiarism.
 They learned much  from the shrewd citizen about the general condition of the place, which  seemed outwardly too peaceful and prosperous for such wild and senseless  outbreaks.
    "If, as seems probable, this is the act of some crazy socialist, he has  unwittingly done harm to the cause of reform in general," said Raeburn  to Erica when the informant had passed on.
 "Those papers for Hasenbalg  were important ones, and, if laid hold of by unfriendly hands, might do  untold harm.
 Socialism is the most foolish system on earth.
 Inevitably  it turns to this sort of violence when the uneducated have seized on its  main idea.
    "After all, I believe they will save the house," said Erica.
 "Just look  at those men on the top, how splendidly they are working!"    It was, in truth, a grand, though a very horrible sight to see the dark  forms toiling away, hewing down the burning rafters with an absolute  disregard to their personal safety.
 These were not firemen, but  volunteers chimney-sweeps, as one of the crowd informed Raeburn and it  was in the main owing to their exertions that the fire was at length  extinguished.
    After the excitement was over, they went into the neighboring hotel,  where there was some difficulty in obtaining rooms, as all the  burned-out people had taken refuge there.
 However, the utmost  hospitality and friendliness prevailed, and even hungry Englishmen,  cheated of their dinner, were patient for once, while the overtaxed  waiters hurried to and fro, preparing for the second and quite  unexpected table d'hote.
 Everyone had something to tell either of his  escape or his losses.
 One lady had seen her night gown thrown out of the  window, and had managed adroitly to catch it; some one else on rushing  up to find his purse had been deluged by the fire engine, and Raeburn's  story of the little German boy excited great interest.
 The visitors were  inclined to make a hero of him.
 Once, when he had left the room, Erica  heard a discussion about him with no little amusement.
    "Who is the very tall, white-haired man?"    "The man who saved the child? I believe he must be the Bishop of  Steneborough; he is traveling in the Tyrol, I know, and I'm sure that  man is a somebody.
 So much dignity, and such power over everybody!  Didn't you see the way the captain of the fire brigade deferred to him?"    "Well, now I think of it," replied the other, "he has an earnest,  devotional sort of face, perhaps you're right.
 I'll speak to him when he  comes back.
 Ah!" in a lower voice, "there he is! And Confound it! He's  got no gaiters! Goodbye to my visions of life-long friendship and a  comfortable living for Dick!"    In spite of his anxiety about the lost packet, Raeburn laughed heartily  over Erica's account of this conversation.
 He had obtained leave to  search the deserted hotel, and a little before ten o'clock they made  their way across the square, over planks and charred rafters, broken  glass, and pools of water, which were hard to steer through in the  darkness.
 The fire was now quite out, and they were beginning to move  the furniture in again, but the place had been entirely dismantled, and  looked eerie and forlorn.
 On the staircase was a decapitated statue, and  broken and crushed plants were strewn about.
 Erica's room was quite bare  of furniture, nor could she find any of the things she wanted.
 The pen  with which she had been writing lay on the floor, and also a Japanese  fan soaked with water, but neither of these were very serviceable  articles to a person bereft of every toilet requisite.
    "I shall have to lie down tonight like a dog, and get up in the morning,  and shake myself," she said, laughing.
    And probably a good many people in Innsbruck were that evening in like  case.
    Notwithstanding the discomforts, however, and the past excitement, that  was the first night in which Erica had really slept since the day at  Fiesole, the first night unbroken by dreams about Brian, unhaunted by  that blanched, rigid face, which had stamped its image indelibly upon  her brain in the amphitheatre.
 She awoke, too, without that almost  intolerable dread of the coming day which had hitherto made early  morning hateful to her.
 It was everything to have an actual and  practicable duty ready to hand, everything to have a busy present which  would crowd out past and future, if only for a few hours.
 Also, the  disaster had its comic side.
 Through the thin partition she could hear  distinctly the complaints of the people in the next room.
    "How ARE we to get on with no soap? Do go and see if James has any.
"    Then came steps in the passage, and a loud knock at the opposite door.
    "James!"    No answer.
 A furiously loud second knock.
    "JAMES!"    "What's the matter? Another fire?"    "Have you any soap?"    "Any what?" sleepily.
    "Any SOAP?"    Apparently James was not the happy possessor of that necessary of life  for the steps retreated, and the bell was violently rung.
    "'What, no soap?'" exclaimed Erica, laughing; "'so he died, and she very  imprudently married the barber, etc.
'"    The chamber maid came to answer the bell.
    "Send some one to the nearest shop, please, and get me some soap.
"    "And a sponge," said another.
    "And a brush and comb," said the first.
    "Oh! And some hair pins," echoed the other.
 "Why, destruction! She  doesn't understand a word! What's the German for soap? Give me 'Travel  Talk.
'"    "It's burned.
"    "Well, then, show her the soap dish! Brush your hair with your hands!  This is something between Drum Crambo and Mulberry Bush!"    The whole day was not unlike a fatiguing game of hide-and-seek, and had  it not been for Raeburn's great anxiety, it would have been exceedingly  amusing.
 Everything was now inside the hotel again, but of course in the  wildest confusion.
 The personal property of the visitors was placed, as  it came to light, in the hall porter's little room; but things were to  be met with in all directions.
 At ten o'clock, one of Raeburn's boots  was found on the third story; in the evening, its fellow turned up  in the entrance hall.
 Distracted tourists were to be seen in all  directions, burrowing under heaps of clothes, or vainly opening  cupboards and drawers, and the delight of finding even the most trifling  possession was great.
 For hours Raeburn and Erica searched for the lost  papers in vain.
 At length, in the evening, the coat was found; but,  alas! The pocket was empty.
    "The envelope must have been taken out," said Erica.
 "Was it directed?"    "Unfortunately, yes," said Raeburn.
 "But, after all, there is still a  chance that it may have tumbled out as the coat fell.
 If so, we may find  it elsewhere.
 I've great faith in the honesty of these Innsbruck people,  notwithstanding the craze of some of them that property is theft.
 That  worthy man yesterday was right, I expect.
 I hear that the proprietor had  had a threatening letter not long ago to this effect:        "'Sein thun unser Dreissig,      Schuren thun wir fleissig.
      Dem Armen that's nichts      Dem Reichen schad's nichts.
    That is tolerably unmistakable, I think.
 I'll have it in next week's  'Idol,' with an article on the folly of socialism.
"    Judicious offers of reward failed to bring the papers to light, and  Raeburn was so much vexed about it, and so determined to search every  nook and cranny of the hotel, that it was hard to get him away even for  meals.
 Erica could not help feeling that it was hard that the brief days  of relaxation he had allowed himself should be so entirely spoiled.
    "Now, if I were a model daughter, I should dream where to find the  thing," she said, laughingly, as she wished him good night.
    She did not dream at all, but she was up as soon as it was light,  searching once more with minute faithfulness in every part of the hotel.
  At length she came to a room piled from floor to ceiling with linen,  blankets, and coverlets.
    "Have all these been shaken?" she asked of the maid servant who had been  helping her.
    "Well, not shaken, I think," owned the servant.
 "We were in a hurry, you  see; but they are all fresh folded.
"    "It might have slipped into one of them," said Erica.
 "Help me to shake  every one of these, and I will give you two gulden.
"    It was hard work, and somewhat hopeless work; but Erica set about it  with all the earnestness and thoroughness of her Raeburn nature, and at  length came her reward.
 At the very bottom of the huge pile they came  to a counterpane, and, as they opened it, out fell the large, thick  envelope directed to Herr Hasenbalg.
 With a cry of joy, Erica snatched  it up, pressed double the reward into the hands of the delighted  servant, and flew in search of her father.
 She found him groping in a  great heap of miscellaneous goods in the porter's room.
    "I've found my razors," he said, looking up, "and every  twopenny-halfpenny thing out of my traveling bag; but the papers, of  course, are nowhere.
"    "What's your definition of 'nowhere'?" asked Erica, laughingly covering  his eyes while she slipped the envelope into his hand.
    His look of relief made her happier than she had been for days.
 He stood  up quickly, and turned the envelope over to see that it had not been  tampered with.
    "This is my definition of a dear, good bairn," he said, putting his hand  on her head.
 "You have taken a hundred-weight off my heart, Eric.
 Where  did you find it?"    She described her search to him.
    "Well, now, nothing will satisfy me but a mountain," said Raeburn.
 "Are  you too tired? We could have a good climb before dinner.
"    "Oh, let us!" she exclaimed.
 "I have had such a longing to get nearer  the snow.
"    Each felt that the holiday had now begun.
 They threw care to the winds,  and gave themselves up altogether to the enjoyment of the loveliest walk  they had ever taken.
 Crossing the Kreuzer bridge, they made their way  past little wooden chalets, through groves of oak where the sunlight  came flickering in between the leaves, through pine woods whose long  vistas were solemn as cathedral aisles, until at last they gained the  summit of the lower range of hills, from which was a glorious view  on every hand.
 Down below lay the little town which would be forever  memorable to them; while above them rose the grand chain of snowy  mountains which still seemed as lofty and unapproachable as ever, though  they themselves were on high ground.
 Soft and velvety and green lay  that great upward sweep in the sunshine, shaded in some places by a dark  patch of pines, or gleaming with a heap of fallen snow.
 Here and there  some deep rugged cleft would be filled from top to bottom with the  gleaming whiteness, while above, crowning the steep and barren height,  the snow reigned supreme, unmelted as yet even by the hot May sun.
    And Erica was, in spite of her sorrow, unfeignedly happy.
 She could not  be sad when her father was so thoroughly enjoying himself, when for once  he was altogether removed from the baleful influences of hatred, malice,  and all uncharitableness.
 Here instead of sweeping denunciations,  which invariably drove him, as they drove even the patient Job, to an  assertion of his own righteousness there was the silent yet most real  teaching of Nature; and he must be a small-souled man, indeed, who,  in the presence of grand mountain scenery, can not forget his own  personality, realizing the infinite beauty and the unspeakable greatness  of nature.
 Erica's father was unquestionably a large-souled man, in  every sense of the word, a great man; but the best man in the world is  to a great extent dependent on circumstance, and the circumstances of  Raeburn's life had been exceptionally hard.
 Only two things on earth  acted as a check upon the one great fault which marred an otherwise fine  character.
 Beauty of scenery made him for the time being as humble as  a child, and the devotion of his own followers sometimes made him ask  himself whether he were worthy of such love.
    The following day the papers, which had caused them so much trouble and  anxiety, were safely delivered to Herr Hasenbalg at Salzburg; and then  came one more perfect holiday.
 In the months that followed, Erica loved  just to shut her eyes and forget a sad or stormy present, to call up  once more the remembrance of that time.
 To the minutest details she  always remembered it.
 The start in the early morning, which had seemed  cloudy and unpromising, the long, beautiful drive to Berchtesgaden,  and on beyond to the Konigsee.
 The perfect and unbroken calm of that  loveliest of lakes, so jealously guarded by its chain of mountains that  only in two places is it possible to effect a landing.
 The dark pines  and silvery birches clothing the sides of the mountains; the gray  limestone cliffs rising step and sheer from the water, in which their  slim, green skiff glided swiftly on, the oars, which were more like  long, brown spades, pulled by a man and woman, who took it in turns  to sit and stand; the man with gay tie and waistband, Tyrolese hat and  waving feather; the woman wearing a similar hat over a gayly embroidered  head-dress, ample white sleeves, a square-cut bodice, and blue plaid  skirt.
    Here and there a group of light-green larches just caught the sunshine,  or a little boat coming in the opposite direction would suddenly glide  round one of the bends in the lake, its oars splashing a wide line of  silvery brightness in the calm water, in vivid contrast to the dark-blue  prow.
 Then, as they rounded one of the abrupt curves came a glorious  view of snow mountains blue shadows below, and above, in the sunshine,  the most dazzling whiteness, while close to the water from the sheer  precipice of gray rock, sprung here and there a hardy pine.
    They landed beside a quaint little church with cupolas, and had an  exquisite walk through the woods just at the foot of the mountains where  the wealth of gentians and other Alpine flowers made Raeburn's felicity  complete.
    Presently came the return to the little boat, and a quiet row back to  the landing place where their carriage awaited them.
 And then followed  the delightful drive home, past the river which tossed its green waters  here and there into snow-like wreaths of foam, over quaint and shaky  wooden bridges, between gray rocks and groves of plane trees whose  trunks were half veiled in golden-brown moss.
 Then on beneath a hill  catching faraway glimpses of a darkened and mysterious sky through the  forest of stems.
 Then past larger and taller pine trees which, standing  further apart, let in more sky, and left space for the brown earth to  be flecked with sunshine.
 And here, in the most peaceful of all country  regions, they met a handsome-looking peasant in gay Tyrolean attire much  adorned with silver chains since it was Ascension day and a festival.
 He  was leading by the hand his little daughter.
    "That is a peaceful lot," said Raeburn glancing at them.
 "Would we like  to change places with them, little son Eric?"    She laughed and shook her head and fell, nevertheless, into a reverie,  wondering what such a character as her father's would have been under  less hard circumstances, trying to picture a possible life in that  sheltered green valley.
 All was so perfectly peaceful; the very river  grew broader and calmer, cattle grazed by the road side, women walked  slowly along with their knitting in their hands, the fruit trees were  white with blossom.
 As they reached the pretty village of Berchtesgaden  the sun was setting, the square comfortable-looking white houses with  their broad, dark eaves and balconies were bathed in a rosy glow, the  two spires of the little church stood out darkly against the evening  sky; in the platz women were filling their pitchers at a stone fountain  made in the shape of a rampant lion while others were kneeling before  the calvary at the entrance to the village, praying with the reverence  which is one of the characteristics of the Tyrolese.
 Towering above all  in the background rose the two Wartzmann peaks, standing there white and  majestic like guardian angels.
    "What foolish being called seven the perfect number?" said Raeburn,  turning back from a last look at the twin mountains which were now  assuming their cloud caps.
 "Two is the perfect number, is it not, little  one?"    She smiled and slipped her hand into his.
    Then came a wild, desolate part of the road, which passed through a  valley shut in on all sides by mountains, some of them snowy, all wild  and precipitous, and looking strangely desolate in the falling light.
  Erica could not help contrasting it with the view from the amphitheatre  at Fiesole, of that wider amphitheatre of green hills all glowing with  light and love.
 But presently came more peaceful glimpses; pretty little  Schellenburg with its serpentine river winding again and again through  the village street, and the happy-looking peasants chatting at their  doors with here and there a white-capped baby made much of by all.
    At last in the cool of the evening they reached Salsburg once more.
 But  the pleasures of the day were not yet over for as they drew up at the  door of their hotel a well-known figure suddenly emerged from the porch  and hurried toward the carriage.
    "Unexpected as a meteor," said a hearty voice in slightly foreign  accents.
 "Well, my good friend, well my guardian angel, how are you  both? We meet under more auspicious circumstances this time!"    It was Eric Haeberlein.
        .
 The Most Unkindest Cut of All         Those who persecuted them supposed of course that they were       defending Christianity, but Christianity can be defended in       no such way.
  It forbids all persecution all persecution for       the sake of religion.
  Force cannot possibly propagate the       truth or produce the faith, or promote the love in which the       gospel consists.
.
.
.
 Persecution can never arise from zeal       for the Gospel as truth from zeal for the Gospel properly       understood.
  If ever due to zeal in any measure, and not to       pride, selfishness, anger, ambition, and other hateful lusts      .
.
.
  It must be to a zeal which is in alliance with error.
      .
.
.
  The men (atheists) therefore, who, by their courage       and endurance were specially instrumental in convincing       their countrymen that persecution for the avowal and       advocacy even of atheism is a folly and a crime, have really       rendered a service to the cause of Christian truth, and       their names will not be recorded without honor when the       history of our century is impartially written.

    A few days later the brief holiday ended, and father and daughter were  both hard at work again in London.
 They had crossed from Antwerp by  night and had reached home about ten o'clock to find the usual busy life  awaiting them.
    Tom and Aunt Jean, who had been very dull in their absence, were  delighted to have them back again; and though the air was thick with  coming troubles, yet it was nevertheless a real home coming, while  Erica, in spite of her hidden sorrow, had a very real enjoyment in  describing her first foreign tour.
 They were making a late breakfast  while she talked, Raeburn being more or less absorbed in the "Daily  Review.
"    "You see, such an early newspaper is a luxury now," said Erica.
 "Not  that he's been behaving well abroad.
 He promised me when we started that  he'd eschew newspapers altogether and give his brain an entire rest; but  there is a beguiling reading room at Florence, and there was no keeping  him away from it.
"    "What's that? What are you saying?" said Raeburn, absently.
    "That very soon, father, you will be as absent-minded as King  Stars-and-Garters in the fairy tale, who one day, in a fit of  abstraction, buttered his newspaper and tried to read his toast.
"    Raeburn laughed and threw down the "Daily Review.
"    "Saucier than ever, isn't she, Tom? Well, we've come back to a few  disagreeables; but then we've come back, thank man! To roast beef and  Turkey towels, and after kickshaws and table napkins, one knows how to  appreciate such things.
"    "We could have done with your kickshaws here," said Tom.
 "If you hadn't  come back soon, Erica, I should have gone to the bad altogether, for  home life, with the cook to cater for one, is intolerable.
 That creature  has only two ideas in her head.
 We rang the changes on rice and stewed  rhubarb.
 The rhubarb in its oldest stage came up four days running.
 We  called it the widow's curse! Then the servants would make a point of  eating onions for supper so that the house was insufferable.
 And at last  we were driven from pillar to post by a dreadful process called house  cleaning in which, undoubtedly, life is not worth living.
 In the end,  Mr. Osmond took pity on me and lent me Brian's study.
 Imagine heretical  writings emanating from that room!"    This led the conversation round to Brian's visit to Florence, and Erica  was not sorry to be interrupted by a note from Mr. Bircham, requesting  her to write an article on the Kilbeggan murder.
 She found that the  wheels of the household machinery would need a good deal of attention  before they would move as smoothly as she generally contrived to make  them.
 Things had somehow "got to wrongs" in her absence.
 And when at  length she thought everything was in train and had got thoroughly into  the spirit of a descriptive article on the Irish tragedy, the cook  of two ideas interrupted her with what seemed, in contract, the most  trivial matters.
    "If you please, miss," she said, coming into the green room, just as the  three villains in black masks were in the act of killing their victim,  "I thought you'd wish to know that we are wanting a new set of kitchen  cloths; and if you'll excuse me mentioning it, miss, there's Jane, miss,  using glass cloths as tea cloths, and dusters as knife cloths.
"    Erica looked slightly distracted, but diverted her mind from the state  of Ireland to the state of the household linen, and, when left alone  once more, laughed to herself at the incongruity of the two subjects.
    It was nearly a fortnight before Brian returned from Switzerland.
 Erica  knew that he was in the well-known house on the opposite side of the  square, and through the trees in the garden, they could see each the  other's place of residence.
 It was a sort of nineteenth-century version  of the Rhine legend, in which the knight of Rolandseek looked down upon  Nomenwerth where his lady love was immured in a convent.
    She had rather dreaded the first meeting, but, when it came, she felt  nothing of what she had feared.
 She was in the habit of going on Sunday  morning to the eight o'clock service at the church in the square.
 It was  nearer than Charles Osmond's church, and the hour interfered less with  household arrangements.
 Just at the corner of the square on the morning  of Trinity Sunday, she met Brian.
 Her heart beat quickly as she shook  hands with him, but there was something in his bearing which set her  entirely at her ease after just the first minute.
 He looked much older,  and a certain restlessness in look and manner had quite left him, giving  place to a peculiar calm not unlike his father's expression.
 It was the  expression which a man wears when he has lost the desire of his heart,  yet manfully struggles on, allowing no bitterness to steal in, facing  unflinchingly the grayness of a crippled life.
 Somehow, joining in that  thanksgiving service seemed to give them the true key-note for their  divided lives.
 As they came out into the porch, he asked her a question.
    "You are an authority on quotations, I know; my father wants to verify  one for his sermon this morning.
 Can you help him? It is this:        'Revealed in love and sacrifice,      The Holiest passed before thine eyes,      One and the same, in threefold guise.
'"    "It is Whittier, I know," said Erica, promptly; "and I think it is in a  poem called 'Trinitas.
' Come home with me, and we will hunt for it.
"    So they walked back together silently, and found the poem, and at  Raeburn's request Brian stayed to breakfast, and fell back naturally  into his old place with them all.
    The following day Raeburn had to attend a meeting in the north of  England; he returned on the Tuesday afternoon, looking, Erica fancied,  tired and overdone.
    "Railway journeys are not quite the rest they once were to me," he  confessed, throwing himself down in a chair by the open window while she  brought him some tea.
 "This is very beguiling, little one; but see, I've  all these letters to answer before five.
"    "Your train must have been very late.
"    "Yes, there was a block on the line, and we stopped for half an hour in  the middle of a bean field bliss that a Londoner can't often enjoy.
"    "Did you get out?"    "Oh, yes, and sat upon the fence and meditated to the great delectation  of my olfactory nerves.
"    Erica's laugh was checked by a knock at the door.
 The servant announced  that a gentleman wanted to see Miss Raeburn.
    "Some message from Mr. Bircham, I expect," said Erica to her father.
  "Ask him upstairs, please.
 I only hope he doesn't want me to write  another article at the eleventh hour.
 If it's the little Irish  sub-editor, you must be very polite to him, father, for he has been kind  to me.
"    But it was no message from the "Daily Review" office; a perfect stranger  was shown into the room.
    He bowed slightly as he entered.
    "Are you Miss Erica Raeburn?" he asked, coming toward her.
    "I am," she replied.
 "What is your business with me?"    "I have to place this document in your hands.
"    He gave her a paper which she rapidly unfolded.
 To her dying day  she could always see that hateful bit of foolscap with its alternate  printing and writing.
 The words were to this effect:    Writ Subpoena Ad Test, at Sittings of High Court.
 IN THE HIGH COURT OF  JUSTICE, QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION.
 Between Luke Raeburn, Plaintiff, and  William Henry Pogson, Defendant VICTORIA, by the Grace of God, of the  United kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the  Faith, To Erica Raeburn, greeting.
 We command you to attend at the  sittings of the Queen's Bench division of our High Court of Justice to  be holden at Westminster on Tuesday, the Twentieth day of June, 18__, at  the hour of half past Ten in the forenoon, and so from day to day during  the said sittings, until the above cause is tried, to give evidence on  behalf of the Defendant.
 Witness, etc.
, etc.
    Erica read the paper twice before she looked up; she had grown white to  the very lips.
 Raeburn, recognizing the form of a subpoena, came  hastily forward, and in the merest glance saw how matters were.
 By no  possibility could the most malicious of opponents have selected a surer  means of torturing him.
    "Is this legal?" asked Erica, lifting to him eyes that flashed with  righteous indignation.
    "Oh, it is legal," he replied bitterly "the pound of flesh was legal.
 A  wife need not appear against her husband, but a daughter may be dragged  into court and forced to give evidence against her father.
"    As he spoke, such anger flashed from his eyes that the clerk shivered  all down his backbone.
 He thought he would take his departure as quickly  as might be, and drawing a little nearer, put down a coin upon the table  beside Erica.
    "This fee is to cover your expenses, madame," he said.
    "What!" exclaimed Erica, her anger leaping up into a sudden flame, "do  you think I shall take money from that man?"    She had an insane desire to snatch up the sovereign and fling it at the  clerk's head, but restraining herself merely flicked it back across the  table to him, just touching it with the back of her hand as though it  had been polluted.
    "You can take that back again," she said, a look of scorn sweeping over  her face.
 "Tell Mr. Pogson that, when he martyrs people he need not say:  'The martyrdom will make you hungry here is luncheon money,' or 'The  torture will tire you here is your cab fare!'"    "But, madame, excuse me," said the clerk, looking much embarrassed.
 "I  must leave the money, I am bound to leave it.
"    "If you leave it, I shall just throw it into the fireplace before your  eyes," said Erica.
 "But if indeed it can't be sent back, then give it to  the first gutter child you meet do anything you like with it! Hang it on  your watch chain as a memento of the most cruel case your firm every had  to do with!"    Her color had come back again, her cheeks were glowing, in her wrath she  looked most beautiful; the clerk would have been less than human if he  had not felt sorry for her.
 There was a moment's silence; he glanced  from the daughter to the father, whose face was still pale and rigid.
  A great pity surged up in the clerk's heart.
 He was a father himself;  involuntarily his thoughts turned to the little home at Kilburn where  Mary and Kitty would be waiting for him that evening.
 What if they  should ever be forced into a witness box to confirm a libel on his  personal character? A sort of moisture came to his eyes at the bare  idea.
 The counsel for the defense, too, was that Cringer, Q.
 C.
, the  greatest bully that ever wore silk.
 Then he glanced once more at the  silent, majestic figure with the rigid face, who, though an atheist, was  yet a man and a father.
    "Sir," he said, with the ring of real and deep feeling in his voice,  "sir, believe me, if I had known what bringing this subpoena meant, I  would sooner have lost my situation!"    Raeburn's face relaxed; he spoke a few courteous, dignified words,  accepting with a sort of unspoken gratitude the man's regret, and in  a few moments dismissing him.
 But even in these few moments the clerk,  though by no means an impressionable man, had felt the spell, the  strange power of fascination which Raeburn invariably exercised upon  those he talked with that inexplicable influence which made cautious,  hard-headed mechanics ready to die for him, ready to risk anything in  his cause.
    The instant the man was gone, Raeburn sat down at Erica's writing  table and began to answer his letters.
 His correspondents got very curt  answers that day.
 Erica could tell by the sound of his pan how sharp  were the down strokes, how short the rapidly written sentences.
    "Can I help you?" she asked, drawing nearer to him.
    He hastily selected two or three letters not bearing on his  anti-religious work, gave her directions, then plunged his pen in the  ink once more, and went on writing at lightning speed.
 When at length  the most necessary ones were done, he pushed back his chair, and getting  up began to pace rapidly to and fro.
 Presently he paused and leaned  against the mantel piece, his face half shaded by his hand.
    Erica stole up to him silently.
    "Sometimes, Eric," he said abruptly, "I feel the need of the word  'DEVIL!' My vocabulary has nothing strong enough for that man.
"    She was too heartsick to speak; she drew closer to him with a mute  caress.
    "Eric!" he said, holding her hands between his, and looking down at her  with an indescribably eager expression in his eyes, "Eric, surely NOW  you see that this persecuting religion, this religion which has  been persecuting innumerable people for hundreds of years, is false,  worthless, rotten to the core.
 Child! Child! Surely you can't believe in  a God whose followers try to promote His glory by sheer brutality like  this?"    It was the first time he had spoken to her on this subject since their  interview at Codrington.
 They had resolved never to touch upon it again;  but a sort of consciousness that some good must come to him through  this new bitterness, a hope that it must and would reconvince his child,  impelled Raeburn to break his resolution.
    "I could sooner doubt that you are standing here, father, with your arm  round me," said Erica, "than I could doubt the presence of your Father  and mine the All-Father.
"    "Even though his followers are such lying scoundrels as that Pogson?  What do you make of that? What do you think of that?"    "I think," she replied quietly, "that my father is too just a man to  judge Christianity by the very worst specimen of a Christian to be  met with.
 Any one who does not judge secularism by its very best  representatives, dead or living, is unfair and what is unfair in one  case is unfair in another.
"    "Well, if I judged it by you, perhaps I might take a different view  of it," said Raeburn.
 "But then you had the advantage of some years of  secularism.
"    "Not by me!" cried Erica.
 "How can it seem anything but very faulty when  you judge it only by faulty people? Why not judge it by the life and  character of Christ?"    Raeburn turned away with a gesture of impatience.
    "A myth! A poetic creation long ago distorted out of its true  proportions! There, child, I see we must stop.
 I only pain you and  torture myself by arguing the question.
"    "One more thing," said Erica, "before we go back to the old silence.
  Father, if you would only write a life of Christ I mean, a really  complete life; the one you wrote years ago was scarcely more than a  pamphlet.
"    He smiled, knowing that she thought the deep study necessary for such an  undertaking would lead to a change in his views.
    "My dear," he said, "perhaps I would; but just see how I am overdone.
 I  couldn't write an elaborate thing now.
 Besides, there is the book on the  Pentateuch not half finished though it was promised months ago.
 Perhaps  a year or two hence when Pogson gives me time to draw a long breath,  I'll attempt it; but I have an idea that one or other of us will have  to be 'kilt intirely' before that happy time arrives.
 Perhaps we shall  mutually do for each other, and reenact the historical song.
" And, with  laughter in his eyes, he repeated:    "There once were two cats of Kilkenny, Each thought there was one cat  too many, So they quarreled and spit, and they scratched and they bit,  Till, excepting their nails and the tips of their tails, Instead of two  cats, there weren't any.
"    Erica smiled faintly, but sighed the next minute.
    "Well, there! It's too grave a matter to jest about," said Raeburn.
 "Oh,  bairn! If I could but save you from that brute's malice, I should care  very little for the rest.
"    "Since you only care about it for my sake, and I only for yours, I think  we may as well give up caring at all," said Erica, looking up at him  with a brave smile.
 "And, after all, Mr. Cringer, Q.
 C.
 can only keep me  in purgatory for a few hours at the outside.
 Don't you think, too, that  such a cruel thing will damage Mr. Pogson in the eyes of the jury?"    "Unfortunately, dear, juries are seldom inclined to show any delicate  considerateness to an atheist," said Raeburn.
    And Erica knew that he spoke truly enough.
    No more was said just then.
 Raeburn began rapidly to run through  his remaining correspondence a truly miscellaneous collection.
 Legal  letters, political letters, business letters requests for his autograph,  for his help, for his advice a challenge from a Presbyterian minister in  the north of Scotland to meet him in debate; the like from a Unitarian  in Norfolk; a coffin and some insulting verses in a match box, and  lastly an abrasive letter from a clergyman, holding him responsible  for some articles by Mr. Masterman, which he had nothing whatever to do  with, and of which he in fact disapproved.
    "What would they think, Eric, if I insisted on holding the Bishop  of London responsible for every utterance of every Christian in the  diocese?" said Raeburn.
    "They would think you were a fool," said Erica, cutting the coffin into  little bits as she spoke.
    Raeburn smiled and penciled a word or two on the letter the pith of a  stinging reply.
        .
 Raeburn v.
 Pogson         Oh, God of mountains, stars, and boundless spaces!       Oh, God of freedom and of joyous hearts!       When Thy face looketh forth from all men's faces       There will be room enough in crowded marts.
       Brood Thou around me, and the noise is o'er;       Thy universe my closet with shut door.
         Heart, heart, awake!  The love that loveth all       Maketh a deeper calm than Horeb's cave.
       God in thee, can His children's folly gall?       Love may be hurt, but shall not love be brave?       Thy holy silence sinks in dews of balm;       Thou art my solitude, my mountain calm.
  George MacDonald    When a particularly unpleasant event has long been hanging over one's  head, sure to come at some time, though the precise date is unknown,  people of a certain disposition find it quite possible to live on pretty  comfortably through the waiting time.
 But when at length the date is  fixed, when you know that that which you dread will happen upon such and  such a day, then the waiting begins all at once to seem intolerable.
 The  vague date had been awaited calmly, but the certain date is awaited with  a wearing anxiety which tells fearfully on physical strength.
 When Erica  knew that the action for libel would begin in a fortnight's time, the  comparative calmness of the nine months which had passed since the  outset of the matter gave place to an agony of apprehension.
 Night after  night she had fearful dreams of being cross-examined by Mr. Cringer,  Q.
C.
, who always forced her to say exactly what she did not mean.
 Night  after night coldly curious eyes stared down at her from all parts of  a crowded court; while her misery was completed by being perfectly  conscious of what she ought to have said directly it was too late.
    By day she was too wise to allow herself to dwell on the future; she  worked doubly hard, laid in a stock of particularly interesting books,  and threw herself as much as possible into the lives of others.
 Happily,  the Farrants were in town, and she was able to see a great deal of them;  while on the very day before the trial came a substantial little bit of  happiness.
    She was sitting in the study doing some copying for her father when a  brougham stopped at the door.
 Erica, who never failed to recognize a  horse if she had once seen it before, who even had favorites among the  dozens of omnibus horses which she met daily in Oxford Street, at once  knew that either Donovan or Gladys had come to see her.
    She ran out into the hall to meet them, but had no sooner opened the  study door than the tiniest of dogs trotted into the room and began  sniffing cautiously at her father's clothes.
    "Tottie has made a very unceremonious entrance," said a clear, mellow  voice in the passage.
 "May we come in, or are you too busy today?"    "Oh, please come in.
 Father is home, and I do so want you to meet,"  said Erica.
 "You have brought Dolly, too! That is delightful.
 We are  dreadfully in want of something young and happy to cheer us up.
"    The two men shook hands with the momentary keen glance into each other's  eyes which those give who have heard much of one another but have never  been personally acquainted.
    "As to Dolly," said Donovan, "she requires no introduction to Mr.  Raeburn.
"    "No," said Erica, laughing, "she cried all over his coat two years ago.
"    Dolly did not often wait for introductions unless she disliked people.
  And no child could have found it in its heart to dislike anything so big  and kind and fatherly as Luke Raeburn.
    "We blought a little dog for Elica," she said, in her silvery treble.
    And the next moment she was established on Raeburn's knee, encouraged  to thrust a little, dimpled hand into his pocket for certain Edinburgh  dainties.
    "Dolly does not beat about the bush," said Donovan, smiling.
 "Would you  at all care to have this small animal? I knew you were fond of dogs,  and Gladys and I saw this little toy Esquimanx the other day and fell  in love with him.
 I find though that another dog rather hurts Waif's  feelings, so you will be doing a kindness to him as well if you will  accept 'Tottie.
'"    "Oh, how delightful of you! It was kind of you to think of it," said  Erica.
 "I have always so longed to have a dog of my own.
 And this is  such a little beauty! Is it not a very rare breed?"    "I believe it is, and I think he's a loving little beggar, too," replied  Donovan.
 "He is making himself quite at home here, is he not?"    And in truth the small dog seemed deeply interested in his new  residence.
 He was the tiniest of his kind, and was covered with long  black hair which stood straight up on end; his pointed nose, bright  brown eyes, and cunning little ears, set in the frame work of bushy  hair, gave him a most sagacious appearance.
 And just now he was brimful  of curiosity, pattering all over the room, poking his nose into a great  pile of "Idol-Breakers," sniffing at theological and anti-theological  books with perfect impartiality, rubbing himself against Raeburn's foot  in the most ingratiating way, and finally springing up on Erica's lap  with the oddest mixture of defiance and devotion in his eyes which said  as plainly as if he had spoken: "People may say what they like about  you, but I'm your faithful dog from this day forward!"    Raeburn was obliged to go out almost directly as he had an appointment  in the city, but Erica knew that he had seen enough of Donovan to  realize what he was and was satisfied.
    "I am so glad you have just met," she said when he had left the room.
  "And, as to Dolly, she's been a real god-send.
 I haven't seen my father  smile before for a week.
"    "Strange, is it not, how almost always children instinctively take to  those whom the world treats as outcasts.
 I have a great belief that  God lets the pure and innocent make up in part by their love for the  uncharitableness of the rest of us.
"    "That's a nice thought," said Erica.
 "I have never had much to do with  children, except with this one.
" And as she spoke she lifted Dolly on  her lap beside Tottie.
    "I have good reason to believe in both this kind and that," said  Donovan, touching the dusky head of the dog and the sunny hair of the  child.
 As he spoke there was a look in his eyes which made Erica feel  inclined almost to cry.
 She knew that he was thinking of the past  though there was no regret in his expression, only a shade of additional  gravity about his lips and an unusual light about his brow and eyes.
 It  was the face of a man who had known both the evil and the good, and had  now reached far into the Unseen.
    By and by they talked of Switzerland and of Brian, Donovan telling her  just what she wanted to know about him though he never let her feel that  he knew all about the day at Fiesole.
 And from that they passed to the  coming trial of which he spoke in exactly the most helpful way, not  trying to assure her, as some well-meaning people had done, that  there was really nothing to be grieved or anxious about; but fully  sympathizing with the pain while he somehow led her on to the thought of  the unseen good which would in the long run result from it.
    "I do believe that now, with all my heart.
" she said.
    "I knew you did," he replied, smiling a little.
 "You have learned it  since you were at Greyshot last year.
 And once learned it is learned  forever.
"    "Yes," she said musingly.
 "But, oh! How slowly one learns in such little  bits.
 It's a great mistake to think that we grasp the whole when the  light first comes to us, and yet it feels then like the whole.
"    "Because it was the whole you were then capable of," said Donovan.
 "But,  you see, you grow.
"    "Want to grow, at any rate," said Erica.
 "Grow conscious that there is  an Infinite to grow to.
"    Then, as in a few minutes he rose to go:    "Well, you have done me good, you and Dolly, and this blessed little  dog.
 Thank you very much for coming.
"    She went out with them to the door and stood on the steps with Tottie in  her arms, smiling a goodbye to little Dolly.
    "That's the bravest woman I know," thought Donovan to himself, "and the  sweetest save one.
 Poor Brian! Though, after all, it's a grand thing to  love such as Erica even without hope.
"    And all the afternoon there rang in his ears the line    "A woman's soul, most soft, yet strong.
"    The next day troubles began in good earnest.
 They were all very silent  at breakfast.
 Raeburn looked anxious and preoccupied, and Erica, not  feeling sure that conversation would not worry him, did not try to talk.
  Once Aunt Jean looked up for a moment from her paper with a question.
    "By the bye, what are you going to wear, Erica?"    "Sackcloth, I think," said Erica; "it would be appropriate.
"    Raeburn smiled a little at this.
    "Something cool, I should advise," he said.
 "The place will be like a  furnace today.
"    He pushed back his chair as he spoke and went away to his study.
 Tom had  to hurry away, too, being due at his office by nine o'clock; and Erica  began to rack her brains to devise the nicest of dinners for them that  evening.
 She dressed in good time, and was waiting for her father in  the green room when just before ten o'clock the front door opened, quick  steps came up the stairs, and, to her amazement, Tom entered.
    "Back again!" she exclaimed.
 "Have you got a holiday?"    "I've got my conge'," he said in a hoarse voice, throwing himself down  in a chair by the window.
    "Tom! What do you mean?" she cried, dismayed by the trouble in his face.
    "Got the sack," he said shortly.
    "What! Lost your situation? But how? Why?"    "I was called this morning into Mr. Ashgrove's private room; he informed  me that he had just learned with great annoyance that I was the nephew  of that (you can supply his string of abusive adjectives) Luke Raeburn.
  Was it true? I told him I had that honor.
 Was I, then, an atheist?  Certainly.
 A Raeburnite? Naturally.
 After which came a long oration, at  the end of which I found myself the wrong side of the office door with  orders never to darken it again, and next month's salary in my hand.
  That's the matter in brief, CUGINA.
"    His face settled into a sort of blank despair so unlike its usual  expression that Erica's wrath flamed up at the sight.
    "It's a shame!" she cried "a wicked shame! Oh, Tom dear, I am so sorry  for you.
 I wish this had come upon me instead.
"    "I wouldn't care so much," said poor Tom huskily, "if he hadn't chosen  just this time for it; but it will worry the chieftain now.
"    Erica was on the verge of tears.
    "Oh, what shall we do what can we do?" she cried almost in despair.
 "I  had not thought of that.
 Father will feel it dreadfully.
"    But to conceal the matter was now hopeless for, as she spoke, Raeburn  came into the room.
    "What shall I feel dreadfully?" he said, smiling a little.
 "If any man  ought to be case-hardened, I ought to be.
"    But as he drew nearer and saw the faces of the two, his own face grew  stern and anxious.
    "You at home, Tom! What's the matter?"    Tom briefly told his tale, trying to make as light of it as possible,  even trying to force a little humor into his account, but with poor  success.
 There was absolute silence in the green room when he paused.
  Raeburn said not a word, but he grew very pale, evidently in this matter  being by no means case-hardened.
 A similar instance, further removed  from his immediate circle, might have called forth a strong, angry  denunciation; but he felt too deeply anything affecting his own family  or friends to be able in the first keenness of his grief and anger to  speak.
    "My boy," he said at last, in a low, musical voice whose perfect  modulations taxed Tom's powers of endurance to the utmost, "I am very  sorry for this.
 I can't say more now; we will talk it over tonight.
 Will  you come to Westminster with us?"    And presently as they drove along the crowded streets, he said with a  bitter smile:    "There's one Biblical woe which by no possibility can ever befall us.
"    "What's that?" said Tom.
    "'Woe unto you when all men speak well of you,'" said Raeburn.
    A few minutes later, and the memorable trial of Raeburn v.
 Pogson had at  length begun.
 Raeburn's friends had done their best to dissuade him from  conducting his own case, but he always replied to them with one of his  Scotch proverbs "A man's a lion in his ain cause.
" His opening speech  was such an exceedingly powerful one that all felt on the first day  that he had been right though inevitably it added not a little to the  disagreeableness of the case.
    As soon as the court had risen, Erica went home with her aunt and Tom,  thankful to feel that at least one day was well over; but her father was  closeted for some hours with his solicitor and did not rejoin them  till late that evening.
 He came in then, looking fearfully tired,  and scarcely spoke all through dinner; but afterward, just as Tom was  leaving the room, he called him back.
    "I've been thinking things over," he said.
 "What was your salary with  Mr. Ashgrove?"    "One hundred pounds a year," replied Tom, wondering at what possible  hour the chieftain had found a spare moment to bestow upon his affairs.
    "Well, then, will you be my secretary for the same?"    For many years Tom had given all his spare time to helping Raeburn with  his correspondence, and for some time he had been the practical, though  unrecognized, sub-editor of the "Idol-Breaker," but all his work had  been done out of pure devotion to the "cause.
" Nothing could have  pleased him more than to give his whole time to the work while his great  love and admiration for Raeburn eminently qualified him for the service  of a somewhat autocratic master.
    Raeburn, with all his readiness to help those in any difficulty, with  all his geniality and thoroughness of character, was by no means the  easiest person to work with.
 For, in common with other strong and  self-reliant characters, he liked in all things to have his own way, and  being in truth a first-rate organizer, he had scant patience with other  people's schemes.
 Erica was very glad that he had made the proposal  to Tom for, though regretting that he should give his life to the  furtherance of work, much of which she strongly disapproved, she could  not but be relieved at anything which would save her father in some  degree from the immense strain of work and anxiety, which were now  altogether beyond the endurance of a single man, and bid fair to overtax  even Raeburn's giant strength.
    Both Charles Osmond and Brian appeared as voluntary witnesses on behalf  of the plaintiff, and naturally the first few days of the trial were  endurable enough.
 But on the Friday the defense began, and it became  evident that the most bitter spirit would pervade the rest of the  proceedings.
 Mr. Pogson had spared neither trouble nor expense; he had  brought witnesses from all the ends of the earth to swear that, in some  cases twenty years ago, they had heard the plaintiff speak such and  such words, or seen him do such and such deeds.
 The array of witnesses  appeared endless; there seemed no reason why the trial ever should come  to an end.
 It bid fair to be a CAUSE CELEBRE, while inevitably Raeburn's  notoriety made the public take a great interest in the proceedings.
 It  became the topic of the day.
 Erica rarely went in any public conveyance  without hearing it discussed.
    One day she heard the following cheering sentiment:    "Oh, of course you know the jury will never give a verdict for such a  fellow as Raeburn.
"    "I suppose they can't help being rather prejudiced against him because  of his views; but, upon my word, it seems a confounded shame.
" "Oh, I  don't see that," replied the first speaker.
 "If he holds such views, he  must expect to suffer for them.
"    Day after day passed and still the case dragged on.
 Erica became so  accustomed to spending the day in court that at last it seemed to her  that she had never done anything else all her life.
 Every day she hoped  that she might be called, longing to get the hateful piece of work over.
  But days and weeks passed, and still Mr. Cringer and his learned friends  examined other witnesses, but kept her in reserve.
 Mr. Bircham had been  exceedingly kind to her, and in the "Daily Review" office, where Erica  was treated as a sort of queen, great indignation had been caused by Mr.  Pogson;'s malice.
 "Our little lady" (her sobriquet there) received the  hearty support and sympathy of every man in the place from the editor  himself to the printer's devil.
 Every morning the office boy brought her  in court the allotted work for the day, which she wrote as well as  she could during the proceedings or at luncheon time, with the happy  consciousness that all her short comings would be set right by the  little Irish sub-editor who worshipped the ground she trod on and was  always ready with courteous and unofficious help.
    There were many little pieces of kindness which served to heighten  that dreary summer for Mr. Pogson's ill-advised zeal had stimulated  all lovers of justice into a protest against a most glaring instance  of bigotry and unfair treatment.
 Many clergymen spoke out bravely and  denounced the defendant's intolerance; many non-conformist ministers  risked giving dire offense to their congregations by saying a good word  for the plaintiff.
 Each protest did its modicum of good, but still  the weary case dragged on, and every day the bitterness on either side  seemed to increase.
    Mr. Pogson had, by fair means or foul, induced an enormous number of  witnesses to come forward and prove the truth of his statement, and day  after day there were the most wearisome references to old diaries, to  reports of meetings held in obscure places, perhaps more than a dozen  years ago, or to some hashed and mangled report of a debate which,  incredible though such meanness seems, had been specially constructed by  some unscrupulous opponent in such a way as to alter the entire meaning  of Raeburn's words--a process which may very easily be effected by a  judicious omission of contexts.
 Raeburn was cheered and encouraged,  however, in spite of all the thousand cares and annoyances of that time  by the rapidly increasing number of his followers, and by many tokens of  most touching devotion from the people for whom, however mistakenly,  he had labored with unwearying patience and zeal.
 Erica saw only too  plainly that Mr. Pogson was, in truth, fighting against Christianity,  and every day brought fresh proofs of the injury done to Christ's cause  by this modern instance of injustice and religious intolerance.
    It was a terribly trying position, and any one a degree less brave and  sincere would probably have lost all faith; but the one visible good  effected by that miserable struggle was the strange influence it exerted  in developing her character.
 She was one of those who seem to grow  exactly in proportion to the trouble they have had to bear.
 And so it  came to pass that, while evil was wrought in many quarters, in this one  good resulted good not in the least understood by Raeburn, or Aunt Jean,  or Tom, who merely knew that Erica was less hot and hasty than in former  times, and found it more of a relief than ever to come home to her  loving sympathy.
    "After all," they used to say, "the miserable delusion hasn't been able  to spoil her.
"    One day, just after the court had reassembled in the afternoon, Erica  was putting the finishing touches to a very sprightly criticism on a  certain political speech, when suddenly she heard the name, for which  she had waited so long, called in the clerk's most sonorous tones "Erica  Raeburn!"    She was conscious of a sudden white flash as every face in the crowded  court turned towards her, but more conscious of a strong Presence  which seemed to wrap her in a calm so perfect that the disagreeable  surroundings became a matter of very slight import.
 Here were hostile  eyes, indeed; but she was strong enough to face all the powers of evil  at once.
 A sort of murmur ran through the court as she entered the  witness box, but she did not heed it any more than she would have heeded  the murmur of the summer wind without.
 She just stood there, strong  in her truth and purity, able, if need be, to set a whole world at  defiance.
    "Pogson's made a mistake in calling her," said a briefless barrister  to one of his companions in adversity; they both spent their lives  in hanging about the courts, thankful when they could get a bit of  "deviling.
"    "Right you are!" replied the other, putting up his eyeglass to look at  Erica, and letting it drop after a brief survey.
 "I'd bet twenty to one  that girl loses him his case.
 And I'm hanged if he doesn't deserve to.
"    "Well, it is rather a brutal thing to make a man's own child give  evidence against him.
 Halloo! Just look at Raeburn! That man's either a  consummate actor, or else a living impersonation of righteous anger.
"    "No acting there," replied the other, putting up his eyeglass again.
  "It's lucky dueling is a thing of the past or I expect Pogson would  have a bullet in his heart before the day was over.
 I don't wonder he's  furious, poor fellow! Now, then here's old Cringer working himself up  into his very worst temper!"    The whispered dialogue was interrupted for a few minutes but was  continued at intervals.
    "By Jove, what a voice she's got! The jury will be flints if they are  not influenced by it.
 Ah, you great brute! I wouldn't have asked her  that question for a thousand pounds! How lovely she looks when she  blushes! He'll confuse her, though, as sure as fate.
 No, not a bit of  it! That was dignified, wasn't it? How the words rang, 'Of course not!'  I say, Jack, this will be as good as a lesson in elocution for us!"    "Raeburn looks up at that for the first time.
 Well, poor devil! However  much baited, he can, at any rate, feel proud of his daughter.
"    Then came a long pause.
 For the fire of questions was so sharp that  the two would not break the thread by speaking.
 Once or twice  some particularly irritating question was ruled by the judge to be  inadmissible, upon which Mr. Cringer looked, in a hesitatingly courteous  manner, toward him, and obeyed orders with a smiling deference; then,  facing round upon Erica, with a little additional venom, he visited his  annoyance upon her by exerting all his unrivaled skill in endeavoring to  make her contradict herself.
    "You'll make nothing of this one, Cringer," one of his friends had  said to him at the beginning of Erica's evidence.
 And he had smiled  confidently by way of reply.
 All the more was he now determined not  to be worsted by a young girl whom he ought to be able to put out of  countenance in ten minutes.
    The result of this was that, in the words of the newspaper reports,  "the witness's evidence was not concluded when the court rose.
" This was  perhaps the greatest part of the trial to Erica.
 She had hoped, not only  for her own, but for her father's sake, that her evidence might all be  taken in one day, and Mr. Cringer, while really harming his own cause  by prolonging her evidence, inflicted no slight punishment on the most  troublesome witness he had ever had to deal with.
    The next morning it all came over again with increased disagreeableness.
    "Erica always was the plucky one," said Tom to his mother as they  watched her enter the witness box.
 "She always did the confessing when  we got into scrapes.
 I only hope that brute of a Cringer won't put her  out of countenance.
"    He need not have feared, though in truth Erica was tried to the utmost.
  To begin with, it was one of the very hottest of the dog-days, and the  court was crowded to suffocation.
 This was what the public considered  the most interesting day of the trial for it was the most personal one,  and the English have as great a taste for personalities as the Americans  though it is not so constantly gratified.
 Apparently Mr. Cringer, being  a shrewd man, had managed in the night watches to calculate Erica's one  vulnerable point.
 She was fatally clear-headed; most aggravatingly and  palpably truthful; most unfortunately fascinating; and, though naturally  quick-tempered, most annoyingly self-controlled.
 But she was evidently  delicate.
 If he could sufficiently harass and tire her, he might make  her say pretty much what he pleased.
    This, at least, was the conclusion at which he had arrived.
 And if it  was indeed his duty to the defendant to exhaust both fair means and foul  in the endeavor to win him his case, then he certainly fulfilled his  duty.
 For six long hours, with only a brief interval for luncheon, Erica  was baited, badgered, tormented with questions which in themselves were  insults, assured that she had said what she had not said, tempted to say  what she did not mean, involved in fruitless discussions about places  and dates and, in fact, so thoroughly tortured, that most girls would  long before have succumbed.
 She did not succumb, but she grew whiter  and whiter save when some vile insinuation brought a momentary wave of  crimson across her face.
    Tom listened breathlessly to the examination which went on in a constant  crescendo of bitterness.
    "The plaintiff was in the habit of doing this?"    "Yes.
"    "Your suspicion was naturally excited, then?"    "Certainly not.
"    "Not excited?" incredulously.
    "Not in the least.
"    "You are an inmate of the plaintiff's house, I believe?"    "I am.
"    "But this has not always been the case?"    "All my life with the exception of two years.
"    "Your reason for the two years' absence had a connection with the  plaintiff's mode of life, had it not?"    "Not in the sense you wish to imply.
 It had a connection with our  extreme poverty.
"    "Though an inmate of you father's house, you are often away from home?"    "No, very rarely.
"    "Oblige me by giving a straightforward answer.
 What do you mean by  rarely?"    "Very seldom.
"    "This is mere equivocation; will you give me a straightforward reply?"    "I can't make it more so," said Erica, keeping her temper perfectly and  replying to the nagging interrogatories.
 "Do you mean once a year, twice  a year?" etc.
, etc.
, with a steady patience which foiled Mr. Cringer  effectually.
 He opened a fresh subject.
    "Do you remember the 1st of September last year?"    "I do.
"    "Do you remember what happened then?"    "Partridge shooting began.
"    There was much laughter at this reply; she made it partly because even  now the comic side of everything struck her, partly because she wanted  to gain time.
 What in the world was Mr. Cringer driving at?    "Did not something occur that night in Guilford Terrace which you were  anxious to conceal?"    For a moment Erica was dumfounded.
 It flashed upon her that he knew of  the Haeberlein adventure and meant to serve his purpose by distorting it  into something very different.
 Luckily she was almost as rapid a thinker  as her father; she saw that there was before her a choice of two evils.
  She must either allow Mr. Cringer to put an atrocious construction on  her unqualified "yes" or she must boldly avow Haeberlein's visit.
    "With regard to my father there was nothing to conceal," she replied.
    "Will you swear that there was NOTHING to conceal?"    "With regard to my father there was nothing to conceal," she replied.
    "Don't bandy words with me.
 Will you repeat my formula 'Nothing to  conceal?'"    "No, I will not repeat that.
"    "You admit that there WAS something to conceal?"    "If you call Eric Haeberlein 'something' yes.
"    There was a great sensation in the court at these words.
 But Mr. Cringer  was nonplused.
 The mysterious "something," out of which he had intended  to make such capital, was turned into a boldly avowed reality a reality  which would avail him nothing.
 Moreover, most people would now see  through his very unworthy maneuvers.
 Furiously he hurled question upon  question at Erica.
 He surpassed himself in sheer bullying.
 By this time,  too, she was very weary.
 The long hours of standing, the insufferable  atmosphere, the incessant stabs at her father's character made the  examination almost intolerable.
 And the difficulty of answering the fire  of questions was great.
 She struggled on, however, until the time came  when Raeburn stood up to ask whether a certain question was allowable.
  She looked at him then for the first time, saw how terribly he was  feeling her interminable examination, and for a moment lost heart.
 The  rows of people grew hazy and indistinct.
 Mr. Cringer's face got all  mixed up with his wig, she had to hold tightly to the railing.
 How much  longer could she endure?    "Yet you doubtless thought this probable?" continued her tormentor.
    "Oh, no! On the contrary, quite the reverse," said Erica with a  momentary touch of humor.
    "Are you acquainted with the popular saying: 'None are so blind as those  who will not see?'"    The tone was so insulting that indignation restored Erica to her full  strength; she was stung into giving a sharp retort.
    "Yes," she said very quietly.
 "It has often occurred to me during this  action as strangely applicable to the defendant.
"    Mr. Cringer looked as if he could have eaten her.
 There was a burst of  applause which was speedily suppressed.
    "Yet you do not, of course, mean to deny the whole allegation?"    "Emphatically!"    "Are you aware that people will think you either a deluded innocent or  an infamous deceiver?"    "I am not here to consider what people may think of me, but to speak the  truth.
"    And as she spoke she involuntarily glanced toward those twelve  fellow-countrymen of hers upon whose verdict so much depended.
 Probably  even the oldest, even the coldest of the jurymen felt his heart beat a  little faster as those beautiful, sad honest eyes scanned the jury box.
  As for the counsel for the defense, he prudently accepted his defeat  and, as Raeburn would not ask a single question of his daughter in  cross-examination, another witness was called.
    Long after, it was a favorite story among the young barristers of how  Mr. Cringer was checkmated by Raeburn's daughter.
    The case dragged on its weary length till August.
 At last, when two  months of the public time had been consumed, when something like 20,000  pounds had been spent, when most bitter resentment had been stirred up  among the secularists, Mr. Pogson's defense came to an end.
 Raeburn's  reply was short, but effective; and the jury returned a verdict in his  favor, fixing the damages, however, at the very lowest sum, not because  they doubted that Raeburn had been most grossly libeled, but because the  plaintiff had the misfortune to be an atheist.
        .
 Rose's Adventure         If Christians would teach Infidels to be just to       Christianity, they should themselves be just to infidelity.
       John Stuart Mill    The green room was one of those rooms which show to most advantage on a  winter evening; attractive and comfortable at all times, it nevertheless  reached its highest degree of comfort when the dusky green curtains were  drawn, when the old wainscoted walls were lighted up by the red glow  from the fire, and the well-worn books on the shelves were mellowed  by the soft light into a uniform and respectable brown.
 One November  evening, when without was the thickest of London fogs, Erica was sitting  at her writing table with Friskarina on her lap, and Tottie curled up  at her feet, preparing for one of her science classes, when she was  interrupted by the sound of a cab drawing up, speedily followed by a  loud ring at the bell.
    "Surely Monsieur Noirol can't have come already!" she said to herself,  looking at her watch.
 It was just six o'clock, a whole hour before  dinner time.
 Steps were approaching the door, however, and she was just  inhospitably wishing her guest elsewhere, when to her intense amazement  the servant announced "Miss Fane-Smith.
"    She started forward with an exclamation of incredulity for it seemed  absurd to think of Rose actually coming to see her in her father's  house.
 But incredulity was no longer possible when Rose herself entered,  in ulster and traveling hat, with her saucy laughing face, and her  invariable content with herself and the world in general.
    "Why, Erica!" she cried, kissing her on both cheeks, "I don't believe  you're half properly glad to see me! Did you think it was my wraith? I  assure you it's my own self in the flesh, and very cold flesh, too.
 What  a delightful room! I'd no idea atheists' homes were so much like other  people's.
 You cold-hearted little cousin, why don't you welcome me?"    "I am very glad to see you," said Erica, kissing her again.
 "But, Rose,  what did bring you here?"    "A fusty old cab, a four-wheeler, a growler, don't you call them? But,  if you knew why I have come to you in this unexpected way, you would  treat me like the heroine I am, and not stand there like an incarnation  of prudent hesitation.
 I've bee treated like the man in the parable,  I've fallen among thieves, and am left with my raiment, certainly, but  not a farthing besides in the world.
 And now, of course, you'll enact  the good Samaritan.
.
"    "Come and get warm," said Erica, drawing a chair toward the fire, but  still feeling uncomfortable at the idea of Mr. Fane-Smith's horror and  dismay could he have seen his daughter's situation.
    "How do you come to be in town, Rose, and where were you robbed?"    "Why, I was going to stay with the Alburys at Sandgale, and left home  about three, but at Paddington, when I went to get my ticket, lo and  behold my purse had disappeared, and I was left lamenting, like Lord  Ullin in the song.
"    "Have you any idea who took it?"    "Yes, I rather think it must have been a man on the Paddington platform  who walked with a limp.
 I remember his pushing up against me very  roughly, and I suppose that was when he took it.
 The porters were all  horrid about it, though, I could get no one to help me, and I hadn't  even the money to get my ticket.
 At last an old lady, who had heard of  my penniless condition, advised me to go to any friends I might happen  to have in London, and I bethought me of my cousin Erica.
 You will  befriend me, won't you? For it is impossible to get to Sandgale tonight;  there is no other train stopping there.
"    "I wish I knew what was right," said Erica, looking much perplexed.
 "You  see, Rose, I'm afraid Mr. Fane-Smith would not like you to come here.
"    "Oh, nonsense," said Rose, laughing.
 "He couldn't mind in such a case  as this.
 Why, I can't stay in the street all night.
 Besides, he doesn't  know anything about your home, how should he?"    This was true enough, but still Erica hesitated.
    "Who was that white-haired patriarchal-looking man whom I met in the  hall?" asked Rose.
 "A sort of devotional quaker-kind of man.
"    Erica laughed aloud at this description.
    "That's my father!" she said; and, before she had quite recovered her  gravity, Raeburn came into the room with some papers which he wanted  copied.
    "Father," said Erica, "this is Rose, and she has come to ask our help  because her purse has been stolen at Paddington, and she is stranded in  London with no money.
"    "It sounds dreadfully like begging," said Rose, looking up into the  brown eyes which seemed half kindly, half critical.
    They smiled at this, and became at once only kind and hospitable.
    "Not in the least," he said; "I am very glad you came to us.
"    And then he began to ask her many practical questions about her  adventure, ending by promising to put the matter at once into the hands  of the police.
 They were just discussing the impossibility of getting to  Sandgale that evening when Tom came into the room.
    "Where is mother?" he asked.
 "She has kept her cab at the door at least  ten minutes; I had to give the fellow an extra sixpence.
"    "That wasn't auntie's cab," said Erica, "she came home half an hour ago;  it was Rose's cab.
 I hope you didn't send away her boxes?"    "I beg your pardon," said Tom, looking much surprised and a little  amused.
 "The boxes are safe in the hall, but I'm afraid the cab is gone  beyond recall.
"    "You see it is evidently meant that I should quarter myself upon you!"  said Rose, laughing.
    Upon which Raeburn, with a grave and slightly repressive courtesy, said  they should be very happy if she would stay with them.
    "That will make my adventure perfect!" said Rose, her eyes dancing.
      At which Raeburn smiled again, amused to think of the uneventful life in  which such a trifling incident could seem an "adventure.
"    "It seems very inhospitable," said Erica, "but don't you think, Rose,  you had better go back to Greyshot?"    "No, you tiresome piece of prudence, I don't," said Rose perversely.
  "And what's more, I won't, as Uncle Luke has asked me to stay.
"    Erica felt very uncomfortable; she could have spoken decidedly had she  been alone with any of the three, but she could not, before them all,  say: "Mr. Fane-Smith thinks father an incarnation of wickedness and  would be horrified if he knew that you were here.
"    Tom had in the meantime walked to the window and drawn aside the  curtain.
    "The weather means to settle the question for you," he said.
 "You really  can't go off in such a fog as this; it would take you hours to get to  Paddington, if you ever did get there, which is doubtful.
"    They looked out and saw that he had not exaggerated matters; the fog had  grown much worse since Rose's arrival, and it had been bad enough then  to make traveling by no means safe.
 Erica saw that there was no help  for it.
 Mr. Fane-Smith's anger must be incurred, and Rose must stay with  them.
 She went away to see that her room was prepared, and coming back a  little later found that in that brief time Rose had managed to enthrall  poor Tom who, not being used to the genus, was very easily caught, his  philosophy being by no means proof against a fair-haired, bright-looking  girl who in a very few moments made him feel that she thought most  highly of him and cared as no one had ever cared before for his opinion.
  She had not the smallest intention of doing harm, but admiration was  what she lived for, and to flirt with every man she met had become  almost as natural and necessary to her as to breathe.
    Erica, out of loyalty to Mr. Fane-Smith and regard for Tom's future  happiness, felt bound to be hard-hearted and to separate them at dinner.
  Tom used to sit at the bottom of the table as Raeburn did not care for  the trouble of carving; Erica was at the head with her father in his  usual place at her right hand.
 She put Rose in between him and the  professor who generally dined with them on Saturday; upon the opposite  side were Aunt Jean and M.
 Noirol.
 Now Rose, who had been quite in her  element as long as she had been talking with Tom in the green room, felt  decidedly out of her element when she was safely ensconced between her  white-haired uncle and the shaggy-looking professor.
 If Erica had felt  bewildered when first introduced to the gossip and small "society" talk  of Greyshot, Rose felt doubly bewildered when for the first time in her  life she came into a thoroughly scientific atmosphere.
 She realized that  there were a few things which she had yet to learn.
 She was not fond of  learning so the discovery was the reverse of pleasant; she felt ignorant  and humbled, liking to be AU FAIT at everything and to know things and  do things just a little better than other people.
 Having none of the  humility of a true learner, she only felt annoyed at her own ignorance,  not raised and bettered and stimulated by a glimpse of the infinite  greatness of science.
    Raeburn, seeing that she was not in the least interested in the  discussion of the future of electricity, left the professor to continue  it with Tom, and began to talk to her about the loss of her purse,  and to tell her of various losses which he had had.
 But Rose had the  mortifying consciousness that all the time he talked he was listening to  the conversation between Erica and M.
 Noirol.
 As far as Rose could  make out it was on French politics; but they spoke so fast that her  indifferent school French was of very little service to her.
 By and by  Raeburn was drawn into the discussion and Rose was left to amuse herself  as well as she could by listening to a rapid flow of unintelligible  French on one side, and to equally unintelligible scientific talk on  the other.
 By and by this was merged into a discussion some recent book.
  They seemed to get deeply interested in a dispute as to whether Spinoza  was or was not at any time in his life a Cartesian.
    Rose really listened to this for want of something better to do, and  Raeburn, thinking that he had been neglecting her, and much relieved at  the thought that he had at length found some point of mutual interest,  asked her whether she had read the book in question.
    "Oh, I have no time for reading," said Rose.
    He looked a little amused at this statement.
 Rose continued:    "Who was Spinoza? I never heard any of his music.
"    "He was a philosopher, not a composer," said Raeburn, keeping his  countenance with difficulty.
    "What dreadfully learned people you are!" said Rose with one of her arch  smiles.
 "But do tell me, how can a man be a Cartesian? I've heard of  Cartesian wells, but never--"    She broke off for this was quite too much for Raeburn's gravity; he  laughed, but so pleasantly that she laughed too.
    "You are thinking of artesian wells, I fancy," he said in his  kindly voice; and he began to give her a brief outline of Descartes'  philosophy, which it is to be feared she did not at all appreciate.
  She was not sorry when Erica appealed to him for some disputed fact,  in which they all seemed most extraordinarily interested, for when the  discussion had lasted some minutes, Tom went off in the middle of dinner  and fetched in two or three bulky books of reference; these were eagerly  seized upon, to the entire disregard of the pudding which was allowed to  get cold.
    Presently the very informal meal was ended by some excellent coffee  in the place of the conventional dessert, after which came a hurried  dispersion as they were all going to some political meeting at the East  End.
 Cabs were unattainable and, having secured a couple of link-boys,  they set off, apparently in excellent spirits.
    "Fancy turning out on such a night as this!" said Rose, putting her arm  within Erica's.
 "I am so glad you are not going for now we can really  have a cozy talk.
 I've ever so much to tell you.
"    Erica looked rather wistfully after the torches and the retreating forms  as they made their way down the steps; she was much disappointed at  being obliged to miss this particular meeting, but luckily Rose was not  in the least likely to find this out for she could not imagine for a  moment that any one really cared about missing a political meeting,  particularly when it would have involved turning out on such a  disagreeable night.
    Erica had persuaded Rose to telegraph both to her friends at Sandgale  and to her mother to tell of her adventure and to say that she would  go on to Sandgale on the Monday.
 For, unfortunately, the next day was  Sunday, and Rose looked so aghast at the very idea of traveling then  that Erica could say nothing more though she surmised rightly enough  that Mr. Fane-Smith would have preferred even Sunday traveling to a  Sunday spent in Luke Raeburn's house.
 There was evidently, however, no  help for it.
 Rose was there, and there she must stay; all that Erica  could do was to keep her as much as might be out of Tom's way, and  to beg the others not to discuss any subjects bearing on their  anti-religious work; and since there was not the smallest temptation to  try to make Rose a convert to secularism, they were all quite willing to  avoid such topics.
    But, in spite of all her care, Erica failed most provokingly that day.
  To begin with, Rose pleaded a headache and would not go with her to the  early service.
 Erica was disappointed; but when, on coming home, she  found Rose in the dining room comfortably chatting over the fire to Tom,  who was evidently in the seventh heaven of happiness, she felt as if  she could have shaken them both.
 By and by she tried to give Tom a hint,  which he did not take at all kindly.
    "Women never like to see another woman admired," he replied with a  sarcastic smile.
    "But, Tom," she pleaded, "her father would be so dreadfully angry if he  saw the way you go on with her.
"    "Oh, shut up, do, about her father!" said Tom crossly.
 "You have crammed  him down our throats quite enough.
"    It was of no use to say more; but she went away feeling sore and  ruffled.
 She was just about to set off with Rose to Charles Osmond's  church when the door of the study was hastily opened.
    "Have you seen the last 'Longstaff Mercury'?" said Raeburn in the voice  which meant that he was worried and much pressed for time.
    "It was in here yesterday," said Erica.
    "Then, Tom, you must have moved it," said Raeburn sharply.
 "It's a most  provoking thing; I specially wanted to quote from it.
"    "I've not touched it," said Tom.
 "It's those servants; they never can  leave the papers alone.
"    He was turning over the contents of a paper rack, evidently not in the  best of tempers.
 Rose sprang forward.
    "Let me help," she said with one of her irresistible smiles.
    Erica felt more provoked than she would have cared to own.
 It was very  clear that those two would never find anything.
    "Look here, Erica," said Raeburn, "do see if it isn't upstairs.
 Tom is a  terrible hand at finding things.
"    So she searched in every nook and cranny of the house and at last found  the torn remains of the paper in the house maid's cupboard.
 The rest of  it had been used for lighting a fire.
    Raeburn was a good deal annoyed.
    "Surely, my dear, such things might be prevented," he said, not crossly  but in the sort of forbearing expostulatory tone which a woman  dislikes more than anything, specially if she happens to be a careful  housekeeper.
    "I told you it was your servants!" said Tom triumphantly.
    "They've orders again and again not to touch the newspapers," said  Erica.
    "Well, come along Tom," said Raeburn, taking up his hat.
 "We are very  late.
"    They drove off, and Erica and Rose made the best of their way to  church, to find the service begun, and seats unattainable.
 Rose was very  good-natured, however, about the standing.
 She began faintly to perceive  that Erica did not lead the easiest of lives; also she saw, with a  sort of wonder, what an influence she was in the house and how,  notwithstanding their difference in creed, she was always ready to meet  the others on every point where it was possible to do so.
 Rose could  not help thinking of a certain friend of hers who, having become a  ritualist, never lost an opportunity of emphasizing the difference  between her own views and the views of her family; and of Kate Righton  at Greyshot who had adopted the most rigid evangelical views, and  treated her good old father and mother as "worldly" and "unconverted"  people.
    In the afternoon Tom had it all his own way.
 Raeburn was in his study  preparing for his evening lecture; Mrs. Craigie had a Bible class at the  East End, in which she showed up the difficulties and contradictions of  the Old and New Testaments; Erica had a Bible class in Charles Osmond's  parish, in which she tried to explain the same difficulties.
 Rose was  therefore alone in the green room and quite ready to attract Tom and  keep him spellbound for the afternoon.
 It is possible, however, that no  great harm would have been done if the visit had come to a natural end  the following day; Rose would certainly have thought no more of Tom, and  Tom might very possibly have come to his senses when she was no longer  there to fascinate him.
 But on the Sunday evening when the toils of the  day were over, and they were all enjoying the restful home quiet which  did not come very often in their busy lives, Rose's visit was brought to  an abrupt close.
    Looked at by an impartial spectator, the green room would surely have  seemed a model of family peace and even of Sunday restfulness.
 Rose  was sitting at the piano playing Mendelssohn's "Christmas Pieces," and  giving great pleasure to every one for art was in this house somewhat  overshadowed by science, and it did not very often happen that they  could listen to such playing as Rose's which was for that reason a  double pleasure.
 Tom was sitting near her looking supremely peaceful.
 On  one side of the fireplace Mrs. Craigie and Mrs. MacNaughton were playing  their weekly game of chess.
 On the other side Raeburn had his usual  Sunday evening recreation, his microscope.
 Erica knelt beside him, her  auburn head close to his white one as they arranged their specimens or  consulted books of reference.
 The professor, who had looked in on his  way home from the lecture to borrow a review, was browsing contentedly  among the books on the table with the comfortable sense that he might  justifiably read in a desultory holiday fashion.
    It was upon this peaceful and almost Sabbatical group that a disturbing  element entered in the shape of Mr. Fane-Smith.
 He stood for an instant  at the door, taking in the scene, or rather taking that superficial view  which the narrow-minded usually take.
 He was shocked at the chessmen;  shocked at that profane microscope, and those week-day sections of  plants; shocked at the music, though he must have heard it played as a  voluntary on many church organs, and not only shocked, but furious, at  finding his daughter in a very nest of secularists.
    Every one seemed a little taken aback when he entered.
 He took no notice  whatever of Raeburn, but went straight up to Rose.
    "Go and put on your things at once," he said; "I have come to take you  home.
"    "Oh, papa," began Rose, "how you--"    "Not a word, Rose.
 Go and dress, and don't keep me waiting.
"    Erica, with a vain hope of making Mr. Fane-Smith behave at least  civilly, came forward and shook hands with him.
    "I don't think you have met my father before," she said.
    Raeburn had come a few steps forward; Mr. Fane-Smith inclined his about  a quarter of an inch; Raeburn bowed, then said to Erica:    "Perhaps Mr. Fane-Smith would prefer waiting in my study.
"    "Thanks, I will wait where I am," said Mr. Fane-Smith, pointedly,  ignoring the master of the house and addressing Erica.
 "Thank you," as  she offered him a chair, "I prefer to stand.
 Have the goodness to see  that Rose is quick.
"    "Thinks the chair's atheistical!" remarked Tom to himself.
    Raeburn, looking a degree more stately than usual, stood on the hearth  rug with his back to the fire, not in the least forgiving his enemy, but  merely adopting for himself the most dignified role.
 Mr. Fane-Smith a  few paces off with his anger and ill-concealed contempt did not show  to advantage.
 Something in the relative sizes of the two struck the  professor as comically like Landseer's "Dignity and Impudence.
" He  would have smiled at the thought had he not been very angry at the  discourteous treatment his friend was receiving.
 Mrs. MacNaughton sat  with her queen in her hand as though meditating her next move, but in  reality absorbed in watching the game played by the living chess-men  before her.
 Tom at last broke the uncomfortable silence by asking the  professor about some of Erica's specimens, and at length Rose came down,  much to every one's relief, followed by Erica, who had been helping her  to collect the things.
    "Are you ready?" said her father.
 "Then come at once.
"    "Let me at least say goodbye, papa," said Rose, very angry at being  forced to make this undignified and, as she rightly felt, rude exit.
    "Come at once," said Mr. Fane-Smith in an inexorable voice.
 As he left  the room he turned and bowed stiffly.
    "Go down and open the door for them, Tom," said Raeburn, who throughout  Mr. Fane-Smith's visit had maintained a stern, stately silence.
    Tom, nothing loth, obeyed.
 Erica was already half way downstairs with  the guests, but he caught them up and managed to say goodbye to Rose,  even to whisper a hope that they might meet again, to which Rose replied  with a charming blush and smile which, Tom flattered himself, meant that  she really cared for him.
 Had Rose gone quietly away the next morning,  he would not have been goaded into any such folly.
 A cab was waiting;  but, when Rose was once inside it, her father recovered his power of  speech and turned upon Erica as they stood by the front door.
    "I should have thought," he said in an angry voice, "that after our  anxiety to persuade you to leave your home, you might have known that  I should never allow Rose to enter this hell, to mix with blaspheming  atheists, to be contaminated by vile infidels!"    Erica's Highland hospitality and strong family loyalty were so outraged  by the words that to keep silent was impossible.
    "You forget to whom you are speaking," she said quickly.
 "You forget  that this is my father's house!"    "I would give a good deal to be able to forget," said Mr. Fane-Smith.
 "I  have tried to deal kindly with you, tried to take you from this accursed  place, and you repay me by tempting Rose to stay with you!"    Erica had recovered herself by this time.
 Tom, watching her, could not  but wonder at her self-restraint.
 She did not retaliate, did not even  attempt to justify her conduct; at such a moment words would have been  worse than useless.
 But Tom, while fully appreciating the common sense  of the non-resistance, was greatly astonished.
 Was this his old playmate  who had always had the most deliciously aggravating retort ready? Was  this hot-tempered Erica? That Mr. Fane-Smith's words were hurting her  very much he could see; he guessed, too, that the consciousness that he,  a secularist, was looking on at this unfortunate display of Christian  intolerance, added a sting to her grief.
    "It is useless to profess Christianity," stormed Mr. Fane-Smith, "if you  openly encourage infidelity by consorting with these blasphemers.
 You  are no Christian! A mere Socinian a Latitudinarian!"    Erica's lips quivered a little at this; but she remembered that Christ  had been called harder names still by religious bigots of His day, and  she kept silence.
    "But understand this," continued Mr. Fane-Smith, "that I approve less  than ever of your intimacy with Rose, and until you come to see your  folly in staying here, your worse than folly your deliberate choice of  home and refusal to put religious duty first there had better be no more  intercourse between us.
"    "Can you indeed think that religious duty ever requires a child to break  the fifth commandment?" said Erica with no anger but with a certain  sadness in her tone.
 "Can you really think that by leaving my father I  should be pleasing a perfectly loving God?"    "You lean entirely on your own judgment!" said Mr. Fane-Smith; "if  you were not too proud to be governed by authority, you would see that  precedent shows you to be entirely in the wrong.
 St.
 John rushed from  the building polluted by the heretic Cerinthus, a man who, compared with  your father, was almost orthodox!"    Erica smiled faintly.
    "If that story is indeed true, I should think he remembered before long  a reproof his intolerance brought him once.
 'Ye know not what spirit ye  are of.
" And really, if we are to fall back upon tradition, I may quote  the story of Abraham turning the unbeliever out of his tent on a  stormy night.
 'I have suffered him these hundred years,' was the Lord's  reproof, 'though he dishonored Me, and couldst thou not endure him for  one night?' I am sorry to distress you, but I must do what I know to be  right.
    "Don't talk to me of right," exclaimed Mr. Fane-Smith with a shudder.
  "You are wilfully putting your blaspheming father before Christ.
 But  I see my words are wasted.
 Let me pass! The air of this house is  intolerable to me!"    He hurried away, his anger flaming up again when Tom followed him,  closing the door of the cab with punctilious politeness.
 Rose was  frightened.
    "Oh, papa," she said, trembling, "why are you so angry? You haven't been  scolding Erica about it? If there was any fault anywhere, the fault was  mine.
 What did you say to her, papa? What have you been doing?"    Mr. Fane-Smith was in that stage of anger when it is pleasant to repeat  all one's hot words to a second audience and, moreover, he wanted to  impress Rose with the enormity of her visit.
 He repeated all that he  had said to Erica, interspersed with yet harder words about her perverse  self-reliance and disregard for authority.
    Rose listened, but at the end she trembled no longer.
 She had in her  a bit of the true Raeburn nature with its love of justice and its  readiness to stand up for the oppressed.
    "Papa," she said, all her spoiled-child manners and little affectations  giving place to the most perfect earnestness, "papa, you must forgive me  for contradicting you, but you are indeed very much mistaken.
 I may have  been silly to go there.
 Erica did try all she could to persuade me to go  back to Greyshot yesterday; but I am glad I stayed even though you  are so angry about it.
 If there is a noble, brave girl on earth, it is  Erica! You don't know what she is to them all, and how they all love  her.
 I will tell you what this visit has done for me.
 It has made me  ashamed of myself, and I am going to try to be wiser, and less selfish.
"    It was something of an effort to Rose to say this, but she had been very  much struck with the sight of Erica's home life, and she wanted to prove  to her father how greatly he had misjudged her cousin.
 Unfortunately,  there are some people in this world who, having once got an idea into  their heads, will keep it in the teeth of the very clearest evidence to  the contrary.
    In the meantime, Tom had rejoined Erica in the hall.
    "How can such a brute have such a daughter?" he said.
 "Never mind,  Cugina, you were a little brick, and treated him much better than he  deserved.
 If that is a Christian, and this a Latitudinarian and all the  other heresies he threw at your head, all I can say is, commend me to  your sort, and may I never have the misfortune to encounter another of  his!"    Erica did not reply; she felt too sick at heart.
 She walked slowly  upstairs, trying to stifle the weary longing for Brian which, though  very often present, became a degree less bearable when her isolated  position between two fires, as it were had been specially emphasized.
    "That's a nice specimen of Christian charity!" said Aunt Jean as they  returned to the green room.
    "And he set upon Erica at the door and hurled hard names at her as fast  as he could go," said Tom, proceeding to give a detailed account of Mr.  Fane-Smith's parting utterances.
    Erica picked up Tottie and held him closely, turning, as all lovers of  animals do in times of trouble, to the comforting devotion of those dumb  friends who do not season their love with curiosity or unasked advice,  or that pity which is less sympathetic than silence, and burdens us  with the feeling that our sad "case" will be gossiped over in the same  pitying tones at afternoon teas and morning calls.
 Tottie could not  gossip, but he could talk to her with his bright brown eyes, and do  something to fill a great blank in her life.
    Tom's account of the scene in the hall made every one angry.
    "And yet," said Mrs. MacNaughton, "these Christians, who used to us such  language as this, own as their Master one who taught that a mere angry  word which wounded a neighbor should receive severe punishment!"    Raeburn said nothing, only watched Erica keenly.
 She was leaning against  the mantel piece, her eyes very sad-looking, and about her face that  expression of earnest listening which is characteristic of those who  are beginning to learn the true meaning of humility and "righteous  judgment.
" She had pushed back the thick waves of hair which usually  overshadowed her forehead, and looked something between a lion with a  tangled mane and a saint with a halo.
    "Never mind," said the professor, cheerfully, "it is to bigotry like  this that we shall owe our recovery of Erica.
 And seriously, what can  you think of a religion which can make a man behave like this to one who  had never injured him, who, on the contrary, had befriended his child?"    "It is not Christ's religion which teaches him to do it," said Erica,  "it is the perversion of that religion.
"    "Then in all conscience the perversion is vastly more powerful and  extended than what you deem the reality.
"    "Unfortunately yes," said Erica, sighing.
 "At present it is.
"    "At present!" retorted the professor; "why, you have had more than  eighteen hundred years to improve it.
"    "You yourself taught me to have patience with the slow processes of  nature," said Erica, smiling a little.
 "If you allow unthinkable ages  for the perfecting of a layer of rocks, do you wonder that in a few  hundred years a church is still far from perfect?"    "I expect perfection in no human being," said the professor, taking up  a Bible from the table and turning over the pages with the air of a man  who knew its contents well; "when I see Christians in some sort obeying  this, I will believe that their system is the true system; but not  before.
" He guided his finger slowly beneath the following lines: "'Let  all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil-speaking be  put away from you, with all malice.
' There is the precept, you see, and  a very good precept, to be found in the secularist creed as well; but  now let us look at the practice.
 See how we secularists are treated!  Why, we live as it were in a foreign land, compelled to keep the law yet  denied the protection of the law! 'Outlaws of the constitution, outlaws  of the human race,' as Burke was kind enough to call us.
 No! When I see  Christians no longer slandering our leaders, no longer coining hateful  lies about us out of their own evil imaginations, when I see equal  justice shown to all men of whatever creed, then, the all-conquering  love.
 Christianity has yet to prove itself the religion of love; at  present it is the religion of exclusion.
"    Mrs. MacNaughton, who was exceedingly fond of Erica, looked sorry for  her.
    "You see, Erica," she said, "the professor judges by averages.
 No one  would deny that some of the greatest men in the world have been, and are  even in the present day, Christians; they have been brought up in it,  and can't free themselves from its trammels.
 You have a few people like  the Osmonds, a few really liberal men; but you have only to see how  they are treated by their confreres to realize the illiberality of the  religion as a whole.
"    "I think with you," said Erica, "that if the revelation of God's  love, and His purpose for all, be only to be learned from the lives of  Christians, it is a bad lookout for us.
 But God HAS given us one perfect  revelation of Himself, and the Perfect Son can make us see plainly even  when the imperfect sons are holding up to us a distorted likeness of the  Father.
"    She had spoken quietly, but with the tremulousness of strong feeling,  and, moreover, she was so sensitive that the weight of the hostile  atmosphere oppressed her, and made speaking a great difficulty.
 When  she had ended, she turned away from the disapproving eyes to the only  sympathetic eyes in the room the dog's.
 They looked up into hers with  that wistful endeavor to understand the meaning of something beyond  their grasp, which makes the eyes of animals so pathetic.
    There was a silence; her use of the adjective "perfect" had been  very trying to all her hearers, who strongly disapproved of the whole  sentence; but then she was so evidently sincere and so thoroughly  lovable that no one liked to give her pain.
    Aunt Jean was the only person who thought there was much chance of her  ever returning to the ranks of secularism; she was the only one who  spoke now.
    "Well, well," she said, pityingly, "you are but young; you will think  very differently ten years hence.
"    Erica kept back an angry retort with difficulty, and Raeburn, whose keen  sense of justice was offended, instantly came forward in her defense,  though her words had been like a fresh stab in the old wound.
    "That is no argument, Jean," he said quickly.
 "It is the very unjust  extinguisher which the elders use for the suppression of individuality  in the young.
"    As he spoke, he readjusted a slide in his microscope, making it plain to  all that he intended the subject to be dropped.
 He had a wonderful way  of impressing his individuality on others, and the household settled  down once more into the Sabbatical calm which had been broken by a  bigoted Sabbatarian.
    Nothing more was heard of Rose, nor did Erica have an opportunity of  talking over the events of that Sunday with her father for some days for  he was exceedingly busy; the long weeks wasted during the summer in  the wearisome libel case having left upon his hands vast arrears  of provincial work.
 In some of the large iron foundries you may see  hundreds of different machines all kept in action by a forty horse-power  engine; and Raeburn was the great motive-power which gave life to all  the branches of Raeburnites which now stretched throughout the length  and breadth of the land.
 Without him they would have relapsed, very  probably, into that fearfully widespread mass of indifference which is  not touched by any form of Christianity or religious revival, but which  had responded to the practical, secular teaching of the singularly  powerful secularist leader.
 He had a wonderful gift of stirring up the  heretofore indifferent, and making them take a really deep interest  in national questions.
 This was by far the happiest part of his  life because it was the healthy part of it.
 The sameness of his  anti-theological work, and the barrenness of mere down-pulling, were  distasteful enough to him; he was often heartily sick of it all, and  had he not thought it a positive duty to attack what he deemed a very  mischievous delusion, he would gladly have handed over this part of his  work to some one else, and devoted himself entirely to national work.
    He had been away from home for several days, lecturing in the north of  England.
 Erica was not expecting his return till the following day, when  one evening a telegram was brought in to her.
 It was from her father to  this effect:    "Expect me home by mail train about two A.
M.
 Place too hot to hold me.
"    He had now to a great extent lived down the opposition which had made  lecturing in his younger days a matter of no small risk to life and  limb; but Erica knew that there were reasons which made the people of  Ashborough particularly angry with him just now.
 Ashborough was one of  those strange towns which can never be depended upon.
 It was renowned  for its riots, and was, in fact (to use a slang word) a "rowdy" place.
  More than once in the old days Raeburn had been roughly handled there,  and Erica bore a special grudge to it, for it was the scene of her  earliest recollection one of those dark pictures which, having been  indelibly traced on the heart of a child, influence the whole character  and the future life far more than some people think.
    It was perhaps old memory which made her waiting so anxious that  evening.
 Moreover, she had at first no one to talk to, which made it  much worse.
 Aunt Jean had gone to bed with a bad toothache, and must on  no account be disturbed; and Tom had suddenly announced his intention  that morning of going down to Brighton on his bicycle, and had set off,  rather to Erica's dismay, since, in a letter to Charles Osmond, Donovan  happened to have mentioned that the Fane-Smiths had taken a house there  for six weeks.
 She hated herself for being suspicious; but Tom had been  so unlike himself since Rose's visit, and it was such an unheard-of  thing that he should take a day's holiday during her father's absence,  that it was scarcely possible to avoid drawing the natural inference.
  She was very unhappy about him, but did not of course feel justified in  saying a word to any one else about the matter.
 Charles Osmond happened  to look in for a few minutes later on, expecting to find Raeburn  at home, and then in her relief she did give him an account of the  unfortunate Sunday though avoiding all mention of Tom.
    "It was just like you to come at the very time I was wanting some one to  talk to," she said, sitting down in her favorite nook on the hearth rug  with Friskie on her lap.
 "Not a word has been said of that miserable  Sunday since though I'm afraid a good deal has been thought.
 After all,  you know, there was a ludicrous side to it as well.
 I shall never forget  the look of them all when Rose and I came down again: Mr. Fane-Smith  standing there by the table, the very incarnation of contemptuous anger,  and father just here, looking like a tired thunder cloud! But, though  one laughs at one aspect of it, one could cry one's eyes out over  the thing as a whole indeed, just now I find myself agreeing with Mr.  Tulliver that it's a 'puzzling world.
'"    "The fact is," said Charles Osmond, "that you consent patiently enough  to share God's pain over those who don't believe in Him; but you grumble  sorely at finding a lack of charity in the world; yet that pain is God's  too.
"    "Yes," sighed Erica; "but somehow from Christians it seems so hard!"    "Quite true, child," he replied, half absently.
 "It is hard most hard.
  But don't let it make you uncharitable, Erica.
 You are sharing God;'s  pain, but remember it is only His perfect love which makes that pain  bearable.
"    "I do find it hard to love bigots," said Erica, sighing.
 "They! What do  they know about the thousand difficulties which have driven people into  secularism? If they could but see that they and their narrow theories  and their false distortions of Christ's Gospel are the real cause of it  all, there would be some hope! But they either can't see it or won't.
"    "My dear, we're all a lot of blind puppies together," said Charles  Osmond.
 "We tumble up against each other just for want of eyes.
 We shall  see when we get to the end of the nine days, you know.
"    "You see now," said Erica; "you never hurt us, and rub us the wrong  way.
"    "Perhaps not," he replied, laughing.
 "But Mr. Roberts and some of my  other brethren would tell a different tale.
 By the bye, would you care  to help another befogged mortal who is in the region you are safely out  of? The evolution theory is the difficulty, and, if you have time to  enter into his trouble, I think you could help him much better than I  can.
 If I could see him, I might tackle him; but I can't do it on paper.
  You could, I think; and, as the fellow lives at the other side of the  world, one can do nothing except by correspondence.
"    Erica was delighted to undertake the task, and she was particularly  well fitted for it.
 Perhaps no one is really qualified for the post of  a clearer of doubts who has not himself faced and conquered doubts of a  similar nature.
    So there was a new interest for her on that long, lonely evening, and,  as she waited for her father's return, she had time to think out quietly  the various points which she would first take up.
 By and by she slept a  little, and then, in the silence of the night, crept down to the lower  regions to add something to the tempting little supper which she had  ready in the green room.
 But time crept on, and in the silence she could  hear dozens of clocks telling each hour, and the train had been long  due, and still her father did not come.
    At last she became too anxious to read or think to any purpose; she drew  aside the curtain, and, in spite of the cold, curled herself upon the  window seat with her face pressed close to the glass.
 Watching, in a  literal sense, was impossible, for there was a dense fog, if possible,  worse than the fog of the preceding Saturday, but she had the feeling  that to be by the window made her in some unaccountable way nearer to  her father, and it certainly had the effect of showing her that there  was a very good reason for unpunctuality.
    The old square was as quiet as death.
 Once a policeman raised her hopes  for a minute by pacing slowly up the pavement, but he passed on, and all  was still once more except that every now and then the furniture in the  room creaked, making the eerie stillness all the more noticeable.
 Erica  began to shiver a little, more from apprehension than from cold.
 She  wished the telegram had come from any other town in England, and  tried in vain not to conjure up a hundred horrible visions of possible  catastrophes.
 At length she heard steps in the distance, and straining  her eyes to penetrate the thick darkness of the murky night, was able  to make out just beneath the window a sort of yellow glare.
 She ran  downstairs at full speed to open the door, and there upon the step stood  a link-boy, the tawny light from his torch showing up to perfection  the magnificent proportions of the man in a shaggy brown Inverness, who  stood beside him, and bringing into strong relief the masses of white  hair and the rugged Scottish face which, spite of cold and great  weariness, bore its usual expression of philosophic calm.
    "I thought you were never coming," said Erica.
 "Why, you must be half  frozen! What a night it is!"    "We've been more than an hour groping our way from the station," said  Raeburn; "and cabs were unattainable.
" Then, turning to the link-boy,  "Come in, you are as cold and hungry as I am.
 Have you got something  hot, Eric?"    "Soup and coffee," said Erica.
 "Which would he like best?"    The boy gave his vote for soup, and, having seen him thoroughly  satisfied and well paid, they sent him home, and to his dying day he was  proud to tell the story of the foggy night when the people's tribune  had given him half of his own supper.
 The father and daughter were  soon comfortably installed beside the green room fire, Raeburn making a  hearty meal though it was past three o'clock.
    "I never dreamed of finding you up, little son Eric," he said when the  warmth and the food had revived him.
 "I only telegraphed for fear you  should lock up for the night and leave me to shiver unknown on the  doorstep.
"    "But what happened?" asked Erica.
 "Why couldn't you lecture?"    "Ashborough had worked itself up into one of its tumults, and the fools  of authorities thought it would excite a breach of the peace, which was  excited quite as much and probably more by my not lecturing.
 But I'm not  going to be beaten! I shall go down there again in a few weeks.
"    "Was there any rioting?"    "Well, there was a roughish mob, who prevented my eating my dinner in  peace, and pursued me even into my bedroom; and some of the Ashborough  lambs were kind enough to overturn my cab as I was going to the station.
  But, having escaped with nothing worse than a shaking, I'll forgive them  for that.
 The fact is they had burned me in effigy on the 5th and had so  much enjoyed the ceremony that, when the original turned up, they really  couldn't be civil to him, it would have been so very tame.
 I'm told  the effigy was such a fearful-looking monster that it frightened the  bairnies out of their wits, specially as it was first carried all round  the place on a parish coffin!"    "What a hateful plan that effigy-burning is!" said Erica.
 "Were you not  really hurt at all when they upset your cab?"    "Perhaps a little bruised," said Raeburn, "and somewhat angry with my  charitable opponents.
 I didn't so much mind being overturned, but I hate  being balked.
 They shall have the lecture, however, before long; I'm  not going to be beaten.
 On the whole, they couldn't have chosen a worse  night for their little game.
 I seriously thought we should never grope  our way home through that fog.
 It has quite taken me back to my young  days when this sort of thing met one on every hand; and there was no  little daughter to cheer me up then, and very often no supper either!"    "That was when you were living in Blank Street?"    "Yes, in a room about the size of a sentry box.
 It was bearable all  except the black beetles! I've never seen such beetles before or since  twice the size of the ordinary ones.
 I couldn't convince the landlady  that they even existed; she always maintained that they never rose to  the attics; but one night I armed myself with Cruden's Concordance and,  thanks to its weight and my good aim, killed six at a time, and produced  the corpses as evidence.
 I shall never forget the good lady's face!  'You see, sir,' she said, 'they never come by day; they 'ates the light  because their deeds is evil.
'"    "Were the beetles banished after that?" asked Erica, laughing.
    "No, they went on to the bitter end," said Raeburn with one of his  bright, humorous looks.
 "And I believe the landlady put it all down to  my atheistical views a just retribution for harboring such a notorious  fellow in her house! But there, my child, we mustn't sit up any longer  gossiping; run off to bed.
 I'll see that the lights are all out.
"        .
 Dreeing Out the Inch         Skepticism for that century we must consider as the decay of       old ways of believing, the preparation afar off for new,       better, and wider ways an inevitable thing.
  We will not       blame men for it; we will lament their hard fate.
  We will       understand that destruction of old forms is not destruction       of everlasting substances; that skepticism, as sorrowful and       hateful as we see it, is not an end but a beginning.
       Carlyle    One June evening, an elderly man with closely cropped iron-gray hair,  might have been seen in a certain railway carriage as the Folkestone  train reached its destination.
 The Cannon Street platform was, as usual,  the scene of bustle and confusion, most of the passengers were met by  friends or relatives, others formed a complete party in themselves, and,  with the exception of the elderly man, there was scarcely a unit  among them.
 The fact of his loneliness would not, of course, have been  specially remarkable had it not been that he was evidently in the last  stage of some painful illness; he was also a foreigner and, not being  accustomed to the English luggage system, he had failed to secure a  porter as the train drew up and so, while the others were fighting their  way to the van, he, who needed assistance more than any of them, was  left to shift for himself.
 He moved with great difficulty, dragging  down from the carriage a worn black bag, and occasionally muttering to  himself, not as a peevish invalid would have done, but as if it were a  sort of solace to his loneliness.
    "The hardest day I've had, this! If I had but my Herzblattchen now, how  quickly she would pilot me through this throng.
 Ah well! Having managed  to do the rest, I'll not be beaten by this last bit.
 Potztausend! These  English are all elbows!"    He frowned with pain as the self-seeking crowd pushed and jostled him,  but never once lost his temper, and at length, after long waiting,  his turn came and, having secured his portmanteau, he was before long  driving away in the direction of Bloomsbury.
 His strength was fast  ebbing away, and the merciless jolting of the cab evidently tried him  to the utmost, but he bore up with the strong endurance of one who knows  that at the end of the struggle relief awaits him.
    "If he is only at home," he muttered to himself, "all will be well.
  He'll know where I ought to go; he'll do it all for me in the best way.
  ACH! Gott in himmel! But I need some one!"    With an excruciating jerk the cab drew up before a somewhat grim-looking  house; Had he arrived at the himmel he had just been speaking of, the  traveler could not have given an exclamation of greater relief.
 He  crawled up the steps, overruled some question on the part of the  servant, and was shown into a brightly lighted room.
 At one glance he  had taken in the whole of that restful picture so welcome to his sore  need.
 It was a good sized room, lined with books, which had evidently  seen good service, many of them had been bought with the price of  foregone meals, almost all of them embodied some act of denial.
 Above  the mantel piece hung a little oil painting of a river scene, the sole  thing not strictly of a useful order, for the rest of the contents of  this study were all admirably adapted for working purposes, but were the  reverse of luxurious.
    Seated at the writing table was the master of the house, who had  impressed his character plainly enough on his surroundings.
 He looked  up with an expression of blank astonishment on hearing the name of his  visitor, then the astonishment changed to incredulity; but, when  the weary traveler actually entered the room, he started up with an  exclamation of delight which very speedily gave place to dismay when he  saw how ill his friend was.
    "Why, Haeberlein!" he said, grasping his hand, "what has happened to  you?"    "Nothing very remarkable," replied Haeberlein, smiling.
 "Only a great  wish to see you before I die.
" Then, seeing that Raeburn's face changed  fearfully at these words, "Yes, it has come to that, my friend.
 I've a  very short time left, and I wanted to see you; can you tell me of rooms  near here, and of a decent doctor?"    "Of a doctor, yes," said Raeburn, "of one who will save your life, I  hope; and for rooms there are none that I know of except in this house,  where you will of course stay.
"    "With the little Herzblattchen to nurse me?" said Haeberlein with a sigh  of weary content as he sank back in an arm chair.
 "That would be a very  perfect ending; but think what the world would say of you if I, who  have lent a hand to so much that you disapprove, died in your house;  inevitably you would be associated with my views and my doings.
"    "May be!" said Raeburn.
 "But I hope I may say that I've never refused  to do what was right for fear of unpleasant consequences.
 No, no, my  friend, you must stay here.
 A hard life has taught me that, for one in  my position, it is mere waste of time to consider what people will say;  they will say and believe the worst that can be said and believed about  me; and thirty years of this sort of thing has taught me to pay very  little regard to appearances.
"    As he spoke he took up the end of a speaking tube which communicated  with the green room, Haeberlein watching his movements with the placid,  weary indifference of one who is perfectly convinced that he is in the  right hands.
 Presently the door opened and Erica came in.
 Haeberlein  saw now what he had half fancied at Salzburg that, although loving  diminutives would always come naturally to the lips when speaking of  Erica, she had in truth lost the extreme youthfulness of manner which  had always characterized her.
 It had to a great extent been crushed out  of her by the long months of wearing anxiety, and though she was often  as merry and kittenish as ever her habitual manner was that of a strong,  quick temperament kept in check.
 The restraint showed in everything.
  She was much more ready to hear and much less ready to criticize, her  humorous talk was freer from sarcasm, her whole bearing characterized by  a sort of quiet steadfastness which made her curiously like her father.
  His philosophical calm had indeed been gained in a very different way,  but in each the calmness was the direct result of exceptionally trying  circumstances brought to bear on a noble nature.
    "Herr Haeberlein has come here to be nursed," said Raeburn when the  greetings were over.
 "Will you see that a room is got ready, dear?"    He went out into the hall to dismiss the cab, and Haeberlein seized the  opportunity to correct his words.
    "He thinks I shall get better, but it is impossible, my Herzblattchen;  it is only a question of weeks now, possibly only of days.
 Was I wrong  to come to you?"    "Of course not," she said with the sort of tender deference with which  she always spoke to him.
 "Did you think father would let you go anywhere  else?"    "I didn't think about it," said Haeberlein wearily; "but he wouldn't, you  see.
"    Raeburn returned while he was speaking, and Erica went away quickly to  see to the necessary preparations.
 Herr Haeberlein had come, and she did  not for a moment question the rightness of her father's decision; but  yet in her heart she was troubled about it, and she could see that both  her aunt and Tom were troubled too.
 The fact was that for some time  they had seen plainly enough that Raeburn's health was failing, and they  dreaded any additional anxiety for him.
 A man can not be involved  in continual and harassing litigation and at the same time agitate  perseveringly for reform, edit a newspaper, write books, rush from  Land's End to John O'Groat's, deliver lectures, speak at mass meetings,  teach science, befriend every unjustly used person, and go through the  enormous amount of correspondence, personal supervision, and inevitable  interviewing which falls to the lot of every popular leader, without  sooner or later breaking down.
    Haeberlein had come, however, and there was no help for it.
 They all did  their very utmost for him, and those last weeks of tender nursing were  perhaps the happiest of his life.
 Raeburn never allowed any one to see  how the lingering expectation, the dark shadow of the coming sorrow,  tried him.
 He lived his usual busy life, snatching an hour whenever he  could to help in the work of nursing, and bringing into the sick room  the strange influence of his strength and serenity.
    The time wore slowly on.
 Haeberlein, though growing perceptibly weaker,  still lingered, able now and then to enter into conversation, but for  the most part just lying in patient silence, listening with a curious  impartiality to whatever they chose to read to him, or whatever they  began to talk about.
 He had all his life been a man of no particular  creed, and he retained his curious indifference to the end, though Erica  found that he had a sort of vague belief in a First Cause, and a shadowy  expectation of a personal existence after death.
 She found this out  through Brian, who had a way of getting at the minds of his patients.
    One very hot afternoon she had been with him for several hours when  about five o'clock her father came into the room.
 Another prosecution  under the blasphemy Laws had just commenced.
 He had spent the whole day  in a stifling law court, and even to the dying man his exhaustion was  apparent.
    "Things gone badly?" he asked.
    "Much as I expected," said Raeburn, taking up a Marechal Niel rose  from the table and studying it abstractedly.
 "I've had a sentence  of Auerbach's in my head all day, 'The martyrdom of the modern world  consists of a long array of thousands of trifling annoyances.
' These  things are in themselves insignificant, but multiplication makes them a  great power.
 You have been feeling this heat, I'm afraid.
 I will relieve  guard, Erica.
 Is your article ready?"    "Not quite," she replied, pausing to arrange Haeberlein's pillows while  her father raised him.
    "Thank you, little Herzblattchen," he said, stroking her cheek, "auf  wiedersehen.
"    "Auf wiedersehen," she replied brightly and, gathering up some papers,  ran downstairs to finish her work for the "Daily Review.
"    A few minutes later Brian came in for his second visit.
    "Any change?" he asked.
    "None, I think," she answered, and went on with her writing with an  apprehensive glance every now and then at the clock.
 The office boy was  mercifully late however, and it must have been quite half an hour after  she had left Haeberlein's room that she heard his unwelcome ring.
 Late  as it was, she was obliged to keep him waiting a few minutes for it was  exceedingly difficult in those days to get her work done.
 Not only was  the time hard to obtain, but the writing itself was a difficulty; her  mind was occupied with so many other things, and her strength was so  overtasked that it was often an effort almost intolerable to sit down  and write on the appointed subject.
    She was in the hall giving her manuscript to the boy when she saw her  father come downstairs; she followed him into the study, and one look at  his face told her what had happened.
 He was leaning back in the chair  in which but a few weeks before she had seen Haeberlein himself; it came  over her with a shudder that he looked almost as ill now as his friend  had looked.
 She sat down on the arm of his chair, and slipped her hand  into his, but did not dare to break the silence.
 At last he looked up.
    "I think you know it," he said.
 "It is all over, Erica.
"    "Was Brian there?" she asked.
    "Happily, yes; but there was nothing to be done.
 The end was strangely  sudden and quite painless, just what one would have wished for him.
 But  oh, child! I can ill spare such a friend just now!"    His voice failed, and great tears gathered in his eyes.
 He let his head  rest for a minute on Erica's shoulder, conscious of a sort of relief in  the clasp of arms which had so often, in weak babyhood, clung to him  for help, conscious of the only comfort there could be for him as his  child's kisses fell on his lips, and brow, and hair.
    "I am overdone, child," he said at length as though to account for  breaking down, albeit, by the confession, which but a short time before  he would never have made, that his strength was failing.
    All through the dreary days that followed, Erica was haunted by those  words.
 The work had to go on just as usual, and it seemed to tell on her  father fearfully.
 The very cay after Haeberlein's death it was necessary  for him to speak at a mass meeting in the north of England, and he came  back from it almost voiceless and so ill that they were at their wits'  end to know what to do with him.
 The morrow did not mend matters for  the jury disagreed in the blasphemy trial, and the whole thing had to be  gone through again.
    A more trying combination of events could hardly have been imagined,  and Erica, as she stood in the crowded cemetery next day at the funeral,  thought infinitely less of the quixotic Haeberlein whom she had,  nevertheless, loved very sincerely than of her sorely overtasked father.
  He was evidently in dread of breaking down, and it was with the greatest  difficulty that he got through his oration.
 To all present the sight  was a most painful one and, although the musical voice was hoarse and  strained, seeming, indeed, to tear out each sentence by sheer force of  will, the orator had never carried his audience more completely with  him.
 Their tears were, however, more for the living than for the dead;  for the man who was struggling with all his might to restrain his  emotion, painfully spurring on his exhausted powers to fulfill the duty  in hand.
 More than once Erica thought he would have fainted, and she  was fully prepared for the small crowd of friends who gathered round her  afterward, begging her to persuade him to rest.
 The worst of it was that  she could see no prospect of rest for him, though she knew how sorely he  longed for it.
 He spoke of it as they drove home.
    "I've an almost intolerable longing for quiet," he said to her.
 "Do you  remember Mill's passage about the two main constituents of a satisfied  life excitement and tranquillity? How willingly would I change places  today with that Tyrolese fellow whom we saw last year!"    "Oh! If we could but go to the Tyrol again!" exclaimed Erica; but  Raeburn shook his head.
    "Out of the question just now, my child; but next week when this  blasphemy trial is over, I must try to get a few days' holiday that is  to say, if I don't find myself in prison.
"    She sighed the sigh of one who is burdened almost beyond endurance.
 For  recent events had proved to her, only too plainly, that her confidence  that no jury would be found to convict a man under the old blasphemy  laws was quite mistaken.
    That evening, however, her thoughts were a little diverted from her  father.
 For the first time for many months she had a letter from Rose.
  It was to announce her engagement to Captain Golightly.
 Rose seemed very  happy, but there was an undertone of regret about the letter which was  uncomfortably suggestive of her flirtation with Tom.
 Also there were  sentences which, to Erica, were enigmatical, about "having been so  foolish last summer," and wishing that she "could live that Brighton  time over again.
" All she could do was to choose the time and place for  telling Tom with discrimination.
 No opportunity presented itself till  late in the evening when she went down as usual to say good night to  him, taking Rose's letter with her.
 Tom was in his "den," a small  room consecrated to the goddess of disorder books, papers, electric  batteries, crucibles, chemicals, new temperance beverages, and fishing  rods were gathered together in wild confusion.
 Tom himself was stirring  something in a pipkin over the gas stove when Erica came in.
    "An unfallible cure for the drunkard's craving after alcohol," he said,  looking up at her with a smile.
 "'A thing of my own invention,' to quote  the knight in 'Through the Looking Glass.
' Try some?"    "No, thank you," said Erica, recoiling a little from the very  odoriferous contents of the pipkin.
 "I have had a letter from Rose this  evening.
"    Tom started visibly.
    "What, has Mr. Fane-Smith relented?" he asked.
    "Rose had something special to tell me," said Erica, unfolding the  letter.
    But Tom just took it from her hands without ceremony, and began to read  it.
 A dark flush came over his face Erica saw that much, but afterward  would not look at him, feeling that it was hardly fair.
 Presently he  gave her the letter once more.
    "Thank you," he said in a voice so cold and bitter that she could hardly  believe it to be his.
 "As you probably see, I have been a fool.
 I shall  know better how to trust a woman in the future.
"    "Oh, Tom," she cried.
 "Don't let it--"    He interrupted her.
    "I don't wish to talk," he said.
 "Least of all to one who has adopted  the religion which Miss Fane-Smith has been brought up in a religion  which of necessity debases and degrades its votaries.
"    Her eyes filled with tears, but she new that Christianity would in this  case be better vindicated by silence than by words however eloquent.
 She  just kissed him and wished him good night.
 But as she reached the door,  his heart smote him.
    "I don't say it has debased you," he said; "but that that is its natural  tendency.
 You are better than your creed.
"    "He meant that by way of consolation," thought Erica to herself as she  went slowly upstairs fighting with her tears.
    But of course the consolation had been merely a sharper stab; for to  tell a Christian that he is better than his creed is the one intolerable  thing.
    What had been the extent of the understanding with Rose, Erica never  learned, but she feared that it must have been equivalent to a promise  in Tom's eyes, and much more serious than mere flirtation in Rose's,  otherwise the regret in the letter was, from one of Rose's way of  thinking, inexplicable.
 From that time there was a marked change in  Tom; Erica was very unhappy about him, but there was little to be done  except, indeed, to share all his interests as much as she could, and to  try to make the home life pleasant.
 But this was by no means easy.
 To  begin with, Raeburn himself was more difficult than ever to work with,  and Tom, who was in a hard, cynical mood, called him overbearing where,  in former times, he would merely have called him decided.
 The very best  of men are occasionally irritable when they are nearly worked to death;  and under the severe strain of those days, Raeburn's philosophic calm  more than once broke down, and the quick Highland temper, usually kept  in admirable restraint, made itself felt.
    It was not, however, for two or three days after Haeberlein's funeral  that he showed any other symptoms of illness.
 One evening they were all  present at a meeting at the East End at which Donovan Farrant was also  speaking.
 Raeburn's voice had somewhat recovered, and he was speaking  with great force and fluency when, all at once in the middle of  a sentence, he came to a dead pause.
 For half a minute he stood  motionless; before him were the densely packed rows of listening faces,  but what they had come there to hear he had not the faintest notion.
 His  mind was exactly like a sheet of white paper; all recollection of the  subject he had been speaking on was entirely obliterated.
 Some men would  have pleaded illness and escaped, others would have blundered on.
  But Raeburn, who never lost his presence of mind, just turned to the  audience and said quietly: "Will some one have the goodness to tell me  what I was saying? My memory has played me a trick.
"    "Taxation!" shouted the people.
    A short-hand writer close to the platform repeated his last sentence,  and Raeburn at once took the cue and finished his speech with perfect  ease.
 Every one felt, however, that it was an uncomfortable incident,  and, though to the audience Raeburn chose to make a joke of it, he knew  well enough that it boded no good.
    "You ought to take a rest," said Donovan to him when the meeting was  over.
    "I own to needing it," said Raeburn.
 "Pogson's last bit of malice will,  I hope, be quashed in a few days and, after that, rest may be possible.
  He is of opinion that 'there are mony ways of killing a dog though ye  dinna hang him,' and, upon my word, he's not far wrong.
"    He was besieged here by two or three people who wanted to ask his  advice, and Donovan turned to Erica.
    "He has been feeling all this talk about Herr Haeberlein; people say the  most atrocious things about him just because he gave him shelter at the  last," she said.
 "Really sometimes the accusations are so absurd that  we ourselves can't help laughing at them.
 But though I don't believe in  being 'done to death by slanderous tongues,' there is no doubt that the  constant friction of these small annoyances does tell on my father  very perceptibly.
 After all, you know the very worst form of torture is  merely the perpetual falling of a drop of water on the victim's head.
"    "I suppose since last summer this sort of thing has been on the  increase?"    "Indeed it has," she replied.
 "It is worse, I think, than you have any  idea of.
 You read your daily paper and your weekly review, but every  malicious, irritating word put forth by every local paper in England,  Scotland, or Ireland comes to us, not to speak of all that we get from  private sources.
"    On their way home they did all in their power to persuade Raeburn to  take an immediate holiday, but he only shook his head.
    "'Dree out the inch when ye have thol'd the span,'" he said, leaning  back wearily in the cab but taking care to give the conversation an  abrupt turn before relapsing into silence.
    At supper, as ill luck would have it, Aunt Jean relieved her fatigue  and anxiety by entering upon one of her old remonstrances with Erica.
  Raeburn was not sitting at the table; he was in an easy chair at the  other side of the room, and possibly she forgot his presence.
 But  he heard every word that passed, and at last started up with angry  impatience.
    "For goodness' sake, Jean, leave the child alone!" he said.
 "Is it not  enough for me to be troubled with bitterness and dissension outside  without having my home turned into an arguing shop?"    "Erica should have thought of that before she deserted her own  party," said Aunt Jean; "before, to quote Strauss, she had recourse to  'religious crutches.
' It is she who has introduced the new element into  the house.
"    Erica's color rose, but she said nothing.
 Aunt Jean seemed rather  baffled by her silence.
 Tom watched the little scene with a sort of  philosophic interest.
 Raeburn, conscious of having spoken sharply to his  sister and fearing to lose his temper again, paced the room silently.
  Finally he went off to his study, leaving them to the unpleasant  consciousness that he had been driven out of his own dining room.
 But  when he had gone, the quarrel was forgotten altogether; they forgot  differences of creed in a great mutual anxiety.
 Raeburn's manner had  been so unnatural, he had been so unlike himself, that in their trouble  about it they entirely passed over the original cause of his anger.
 Aunt  Jean was as much relieved as any one when before long he opened his door  and called for Erica.
    "I have lost my address book," he said; "have you seen it about?"    She began to search for it, fully aware that he had given her something  to do for him just out of loving consideration, and with the hope that  it would take the sting from her aunt's hard words.
 When she brought  him the book, he took her face between both his hands, looked at her  steadily for a minute, and then kissed her.
    "All right, little son Eric," he said, with a sigh.
 "We understand each  other.
"    But she went upstairs feeling miserable about him, and an hour or two  later, when all the house was silent, her feeling of coming trouble  grew so much that at length she yielded to one of those strange, blind  impulses which come to some people and crept noiselessly out on to the  dark landing.
 At first all seemed to her perfectly still and perfectly  dark; but, looking down the narrow well of the staircase, she could see  far below her a streak of light falling across the tiles in the passage.
  She knew that it must come from beneath the door of the study, and it  meant that her father was still at work.
 He had owned to having a bad  headache, and had promised not to be late.
 It was perplexing.
 She stole  down the next flight of stairs and listened at Tom's door; then, finding  that he was still about, knocked softly.
 Tom, with his feet on the  mantel piece, was solacing himself with a pipe and a novel; he started  up, however, as she came in.
    "What's the matter?" he asked, "is any one ill?"    "I don't know," said Erica, shivering a little.
 "I came to know whether  father had much to do tonight; did he tell you?"    "He was going to write to Jackson about a situation for the eldest  son of that fellow who died the other day, you know; the widow,  poor creature, is nearly worried out of her life; she was here this  afternoon.
 The chieftain promised to see about it at once; he wouldn't  let me write, and of course a letter from himself will be more likely to  help the boy.
"    "But it's after one o'clock," said Erica, shivering again; "he can't  have been all this time over it.
"    "Well, perhaps he is working at something else," said Tom.
 "He's  not been sleeping well lately, I know.
 Last night he got through  thirty-three letters, and the night before he wrote a long pamphlet.
"    Erica did not look satisfied.
    "Lend me your stove for a minute," she said; "I shall make him a cup of  tea.
"    They talked a little about the curious failure of memory noticed for the  first time that evening.
 Tom was more like himself than he had been for  several days; he came downstairs with her to carry a light, but she went  alone into the study.
 He had not gone up the first flight of stairs,  however, when he heard a cry, then his own name called twice in tones  that made him thrill all over with a nameless fear.
 He rushed down  and pushed open the study door.
 There stood Erica with blanched face;  Raeburn sat in his customary place at the writing table, but his head  had fallen forward and, though the face was partly hidden by the desk,  they could see that it was rigid and deathly pale.
    "He has fainted," said Tom, not allowing the worse fear to overmaster  him.
 "Run quick, and get some water, Erica.
"    She obeyed mechanically.
 When she returned, Tom had managed to get  Raeburn on to the floor and had loosened his cravat; he had also noticed  that only one letter lay upon the desk, abruptly terminating at "I am,  yours sincerely.
" Whether the "Luke Raeburn" would ever be added, seemed  to Tom at that moment very doubtful.
 Leaving Erica with her father,  he rushed across the square to summon Brian, returning in a very few  minutes with the comforting news that he was at home and would be with  them immediately.
 Erica gave a sigh of relief when the quick, firm steps  were heard on the pavement outside.
 Brian was so closely associated with  all the wearing times of illness and anxiety which had come to them in  the last six years that, in her trouble, she almost forgot the day at  Fiesole regarding him not as her lover, but as the man who had once  before saved her father's life.
 His very presence inspired her with  confidence, the quiet authority of his manner, the calm, business-like  way in which he directed things.
 Her anxiety faded away in the  consciousness that he knew all about it, and would do everything as  it should be done.
 Before very long Raeburn showed signs of returning  consciousness, sighed uneasily; then, opening his eyes, regained his  faculties as suddenly as he had lost them.
    "Halloo!" he exclaimed, starting up.
 "What's all this coil about? What  are you doing to me?"    They explained things to him.
    "Oh! Fainted, did I!" he said musingly.
 "I have felt a little faint once  or twice lately.
 What day is it? What time is it?" Tom mentioned  the meeting of the previous evening, and Raeburn seemed to recollect  himself.
 He looked at his watch, then at the letter on his desk.
 "Well,  it's my way to do things thoroughly," he said with a smile; "I must have  been off for a couple of hours.
 I am very sorry to have disturbed your  slumbers in this way.
"    As he spoke, he sat down composedly at his desk, picked up the pen  and signed his name to the letter.
 They stood and watched him while he  folded the sheet and directed the envelope; his writing bore a little  more markedly than usual the tokens of strong self-restraint.
    "Perhaps you'll just drop that in the pillar on your way home," he said  to Brian.
 "I want Jackson to get it by the first post.
 If you will look  in later on, I should be glad to have a talk with you.
 At present I'm  too tired to be overhauled.
"    Then, as Brian left the room, he turned to Erica.
    "I am sorry to have given you a fright, my child; but don't worry about  me, I am only a little overdone.
"    Again that fatal admission, which from Raeburn's lips was more alarming  than a long catalogue of dangerous symptoms from other men!    There followed a disturbed night and a long day in a crowded law court,  then one of the most terrible hours they had ever had to endure while  waiting for the verdict which would either consign Raeburn to prison  or leave him to peace and freedom.
 So horrible was the suspense that to  draw each breath was to Erica a painful effort.
 Even Raeburn's composure  was a little shaken as those eternal minutes dragged on.
    The foreman returned.
 The court seemed to throb with excitement.
 Raeburn  lifted a calm, stern face to hear his fate.
 He knew what no one else in  the court knew, that this was to him a matter of life and death.
    "Are you agreed, gentlemen?"    "Yes.
"    People listened breathlessly.
    "Do you find the defendant guilty, or not?"    "Not guilty.
"    The reaction was so sharp as to be almost overpowering.
 But poor Erica's  joy was but short-lived.
 She looked at her father's face and knew that,  although one anxiety was ended, another was already begun.
        .
 Halcyon Days         There is a sweetness in autumnal days,       Which many a lip doth praise;       When the earth, tired a little, and grown mute       Of song, and having borne its fruit,       Rests for a little ere the winter come.
       It is not sad to turn the face toward home,       Even though it show the journey nearly done;       It is not sad to mark the westering sun,       Even though we know the night doth come,       Silence there is, indeed, for song,       Twilight for noon,       But for the steadfast soul and strong       Life's autumn is as June.
  From the "Ode of Life"    "Anything in the papers this evening?" asked a young clergyman, who  was in one of the carriages of the Metropolitan Railway late in the  afternoon of an August day.
    "Nothing of much interest," replied his wife, handing him the newspaper  she had been glancing through.
 "I see that wretched Raeburn is ill.
 I  wish he'd die.
"    "Oh! Broken down at last, has he?" said the other.
 "Where is it? Oh,  yes, I see.
 Ordered to take immediate and entire rest.
 Will be paralyzed  in a week if he doesn't.
 Pleasant alternative that! Result of excessive  overwork.
 Fancy calling this blasphemous teaching work! I could hang  that man with my own hands!"    Erica had had a long and harassing day.
 She was returning from the city  where she had gone to obtain leave of absence from Mr. Bircham; for her  father was to go into the quietest country place that could be found,  and she of course was to accompany him.
 At the "Daily Review" office she  had met with the greatest kindness, and she might have gone home cheered  and comforted had it not been her lot to overhear this conversation.
 Tom  was with her.
 She saw him hastily transcribing the uncharitable remarks,  and knew that the incident would figure in next week's "Idol-Breaker.
"  It was only a traceable instance of the harm done by all such words.
    "Will you change carriages?" asked Tom.
    "Yes," she said; and as she rose to go she quietly handed her card to  the lady, who, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson thereby.
    But it would be unjust to show only the dark side of the picture.
 Great  sympathy and kindness was shown them at that time by many earnest and  orthodox Christians, and though Raeburn used to accept this sympathy  with the remark: "You see, humanity overcomes the baleful influences of  religion in the long run," yet he was always touched and pleased by the  smallest signs of friendliness; while to Erica such considerateness was  an inestimable help.
 The haste and confusion of those days, added to the  anxiety, told severely on her strength; but there is this amount of good  in a trying bit of "hurrying life," the rest, when it comes, is doubly  restful.
    It was about six o'clock on an August evening when Raeburn and Erica  reached the little country town of Firdale.
 They were to take up their  abode for the next six weeks at a village about three miles off, one  of the few remaining places in England which maintained its primitive  simplicity, its peaceful quiet having never been disturbed by shriek of  whistle or snort of engine.
    The journey from town had been short and easy, but Raeburn was terribly  exhausted by it; he complained of such severe headache that they made  up their minds to stay that night at Firdale, and were soon comfortably  established in the most charming old inn, which in coaching days had  been a place of note.
 Here they dined, and afterward Raeburn fell asleep  on a big old-fashioned sofa, while Erica sat by the open window, able in  spite of her anxiety to take a sort of restful interest in watching the  traffic in the street below.
 Such a quiet, easy-going life these Firdale  people seemed to lead.
 They moved in such a leisurely way; bustle and  hurry seemed an unknown thing.
 And yet this was market day, as was  evident by the country women with their baskets, and by occasional  processions of sheep or cattle.
 One man went slowly by driving a  huge pig; he was in sight for quite five minutes, dawdling along,  and allowing the pig to have his own sweet will as far as speed was  concerned, but occasionally giving him a gentle poke with a stick when  he paused to burrow his nose in the mud.
 Small groups of men stood  talking at the corner of the market place; a big family went by,  evidently returning from a country walk; presently the lamps were  lighted, and then immense excitement reigned in the little place for at  the corner where the two main streets crossed each other at right angles  a cheap-jack had set up his stall and, with flaring naptha lamps to show  his goods, was selling by auction the most wonderful clocks at the very  lowest prices in fact, the most superior glass, china, clothing, and  furniture that the people of Firdale had ever had the privilege of  seeing.
 Erica listened with no little amusement to his fervid appeals to  the people not to lose this golden opportunity, and to the shy responses  of the small crowd which had been attracted and which lingered on,  tempted yet cautious, until the cheap-jack had worked himself up into  a white heat of energetic oratory, and the selling became brisk and  lively.
    By and by the silvery moonlight began to flood the street, contrasting  strangely with the orange glare of the lamps.
 Erica still leaned her  head against the window frame, still looked out dreamily at the Firdale  life, while the soft night wind lightly lifted the hair from her  forehead and seemed to lull the pain at her heart.
    It was only in accordance with the general peacefulness when by and by  her father crossed the room, looking more like himself than he had done  for some days.
    "I am better, Eric," he said cheerfully "better already.
 It is just the  consciousness that there is nothing that need be done.
 I feel as if  I should sleep tonight.
" He looked out at the moonlit street.
 "What a  perfect night it is!" He exclaimed.
 "What do you say, little one; shall  we drive over to this rural retreat now? The good folks were told to  have everything ready, and they can hardly lock up before ten.
"    She was so glad to see him take an interest in anything, and so greatly  relieved by his recovery of strength and spirits, that she gladly fell  in with the plan, and before long they set off in one of the wagonettes  belonging to the Shrub Inn.
    Firdale wound its long street of red-roofed houses along a sheltered  valley in between fir-crowned heights; beyond the town lay rich,  fertile-looking meadows, and a winding river bordered by pollard  willows.
 Looking across these meadows, one could see the massive tower  of the church, its white pinnacles standing out sharp and clear in the  moonlight.
 As Raeburn and Erica crossed the bridge leading out of the  town, the clock in the tower struck nine, and the old chimes began  to play the tune which every three hours fell on the ears of the  inhabitants of Firdale.
    "'Life let us cherish,'" said Raeburn with a smile.
 "A good omen for us,  little one.
"    And whether it was the mere fact that he looked so much more cheerful  already, or whether the dear old tune, with its resolute good humor and  determination to make the best of things, acted upon Erica's sensitive  nature, it would be hard to say, but she somehow shook off all her cares  and enjoyed the novelty of the moonlight drive like a child.
 Before long  they were among the fir trees, driving along the sandy road, the  sweet night laden with the delicious scent of pine needles, and to the  overworked Londoners in itself the most delicious refreshment.
 All at  once Raeburn ordered the driver to stop and, getting out, stooped down  by the roadside.
    "What is it?" asked Erica.
    "Heather!" he exclaimed, tearing it up by handfuls and returning to the  carriage laden.
 "There! Shut your eyes and bury your face in that,  and you can almost fancy you're on a Scottish mountain.
 Brian deserves  anything for sending us to the land of heather; it makes me feel like a  boy again.
"    The three miles were all too short to please them, but at last  they reached the little village of Milford and were set down at a  compact-looking white house known as Under the Oak.
    "That direction is charming," said Raeburn, laughing; "imagine your  business letters sent from the 'Daily Review' office to 'Miss Raeburn,  Under the Oak, Milford!' They'll think we're living in a tent.
 You'll be  nicknamed Deborah!"    It was not until the next morning that they fully understood the  appropriateness of the direction.
 The little white house had been built  close to the grand old oak which was the pride of Milford.
 It was indeed  a giant of its kind; there was something wonderfully fine about its  vigorous spread of branches and its enormous girth.
 Close by was a  peaceful-looking river, flowing between green banks fringed with willow  and marestail and pink river-herb.
 The house itself had a nice little  garden, gay with geraniums and gladiolus, and bounded by a hedge of  sunflowers which would have gladdened the heart of an aesthete.
 All was  pure, fresh, cleanly, and perfectly quiet.
    From the windows nothing was to be seen except the village green with  its flocks of geese and its tall sign post; the river describing a sort  of horseshoe curve round it, and spanned by two picturesque bridges.
  In the distance was a small church and a little cluster of houses, the  "village" being completed by a blacksmith's forge and a post office.
 To  this latter place they had to pay a speedy visit for, much to Raeburn's  amusement, Erica had forgotten to bring any ink.
    "To think that a writer in the 'Daily Review' should forget such a  necessary of life!" he said, smiling.
 "One would think you were your  little 'Cartesian-well' cousin instead of a journalist!"    However, the post office was capable of supplying almost anything likely  to be needed in the depths of the country; you could purchase there  bread, cakes, groceries, hob-nailed boots, paper, ink, and most  delectable toffee!    The relief of the country quiet was unlike anything which Erica had  known before.
 There was, indeed, at first a good deal of anxiety about  her father.
 His acquiescence in idleness, his perfect readiness to spend  whole days without even opening a book, proved the seriousness of his  condition.
 For the first week he was more completely prostrated than she  had ever known him to be.
 He would spend whole days on the river, too  tired even to speak, or would drag himself as far as the neighboring  wood and stretch himself at full length under the trees while she sat by  sketching or writing.
 Bur Brian was satisfied with his improvement when  he came down on one of his periodical visits, and set Erica's mind at  rest about him.
    "You father has such a wonderful constitution," he said as they paced to  and fro in the little garden.
 "I should not be surprised if, in a couple  of months, he is as strong as ever; though most men would probably feel  such an overstrain to the end of their days.
"    After that, the time at Milford was pure happiness.
 Erica learned to  love every inch of that lovely neighborhood, from the hill of Rocksbury  with its fir-clad heights, to Trencharn Lake nestled down among the  surrounding heath hills.
 In after years she liked to recall all those  peaceful days, days when time had ceased to exist at any rate, as  an element of friction in life.
 There was no hurrying here, and the  recollection of it afterward was a perpetual happiness.
 The quiet river  where they had one day seen an otter, a marked event in their uneventful  days; the farm with its red gables and its crowd of gobbling turkeys;  the sweet-smelling fir groves with their sandy paths; and their own  particular wood where beeches, oaks, and silvery birch trees were  intermingled, with here and there a tall pine sometimes stately and  erect, sometimes blown aslant by the wind.
    Here the winding paths were bordered with golden moss, and sheltered by  a tangled growth of bracken and bramble with now and then a little clump  of heather or a patch of blue harebells.
 Every nook of that place grew  familiar to them and had its special associations.
 There was the shady  part under the beeches where they spent the hot days, and this was  always associated with fragments of "Macbeth" and "Julius Caesar.
" There  was the cozy nook on the fir hill where in cool September they had read  volume after volume of Walter Scott, Raeburn not being allowed to have  anything but light literature, and caring too little for "society"  novels to listen to them even now.
 There was the prettiest part of all  down below, the bit of sandy cliff riddled with nest holes by the sand  martins; here they discovered a little spring, the natural basin scooped  out in the rock, festooned with ivy and thickly coated with the pretty  green liverwort.
 Never surely was water so cold and clear as that which  flowed into the basin with its ground of white sand, and overflowed into  a little trickling stream; while in the distance was heard the roar of  the river as it fell into a small waterfall.
 There was the ford from  which the place was named and which Erica associated with a long happy  day when Brian had come down to see her father.
 She remembered how they  had watched the carts and horses splashing though the clear water, going  in muddy on one side and coming out clean on the other.
 She had just  listened in silence to the talk between Brian and her father which  happened to turn on Donovan Farrant.
    They discussed the effect of early education and surroundings upon  the generality of men, and Raeburn, while prophesying great things for  Donovan's future and hoping that he might live to see his first  Budget, rather surprised them both by what he said about his tolerable  well-known early life.
 He was a man who found it very difficult to make  allowances for temptations he had never felt, he was convinced that  under Donovan's circumstances he should have acted very differently, and  he made the common mistake of judging others by himself.
 His ruggedly  honest nature and stern sense of justice could not get over those past  failings.
 However, this opinion about the past did not interfere with  his present liking of the man.
 He liked him much; and when, toward  the end of their six weeks' stay at Milford, Donovan invited them to  Oakdene, he was really pleased to accept the invitation.
 He hoped to  be well enough to speak at an important political meeting at Ashborough  about the middle of October, and as Ashborough was not far from Oakdene,  Donovan wrote to propose a visit there en route.
    At length the last evening came.
 Raeburn and Erica climbed Rocksbury for  the last time, and in the cool of the evening walked slowly home.
    "I have always dreaded old age," he said.
 "But I shall dread it no more.
  This has been a foretaste of the autumn of life, and it has been very  peaceful.
 I don't see why the winter should not be the same if I have  you with me, little one.
"    "You shall have me as long as I am alive," she said, giving his strong  hand a little loving squeeze.
    "Truth to tell," said Raeburn, "I thought a few weeks ago that it would  be a case of 'Here lies Luke Raeburn, who died of litigation!' But,  after all, to be able to work to the last is the happiest lot.
 Tis an  enviable thing to die in harness.
"    They were walking up a hill, a sort of ravine with steep high banks on  either side, and stately pines stretching their blue-green foliage up  against the evening sky.
 A red glow of sunset made the dark stems look  like fiery pillars, and presently as they reached the brow of the hill  the great crimson globe was revealed to them.
 They both stood in perfect  silence watching till it sunk below the horizon.
    And a great peace filled Erica's heart though at one time her father's  wish would have made her sad and apprehensive.
 In former times she had  set her whole heart on his learning before death that he was teaching  error.
 Now she had learned to add to "Thy will be done," the clause  which it takes some of us a life time to say, "Not my will.
"        .
 Ashborough         There's a brave fellow!       There's a man of pluck!       A man who is not afraid to say his say,       Though a whole town's against him.
       Longfellow         A man's love is the measure of his fitness for good or bad       company here or elsewhere.
  Oliver Wendell Holmes.
    The week at Oakdene proved in every way a success; Raeburn liked his  host heartily, and the whole atmosphere of the house was a revelation  to him.
 The last morning there had been a little clouded for news had  reached them of a terrible colliery accident in the north of England.
  The calamity had a special gloom about it for it might very easily have  been prevented, the owners having long known that the mine was unsafe.
    "I must say it is a little hard to see how such a horrible sin as  carelessness of the lives of human beings can ever bring about the  greater good which we believe evil to do," said Erica, as she took her  last walk in the wood with Donovan.
    "'Tis hard to see at the time," he replied.
 "But I am convinced that it  is so.
 The sin is never good, never right; but when men will sin, then  the result of the sin, however frightful, brings about more good  that the perseverance in sin with no catastrophe would have done.
 A  longer-deferred good, of course, than the good which would have resulted  by adhering from the first to the right, and so far inferior.
"    "Of course," said Erica, "I can see that a certain amount of immediate  good may result from this disaster.
 It will make the owners of other  mines more careful.
"    "And what of the hundred unseen workings that will result from it?" said  Donovan, smiling.
 "In the first shock of horror one can not even glimpse  the larger view, but later on--"    He paused for a minute; they were down in the valley close to the little  church; he opened the gate and led the way to a bench under the great  yew tree.
 Sitting here, they could see the recumbent white cross with  its ever-fresh crown of white flowers.
 Erica knew something of the story  it told.
    "Shall I tell you what turned me from an anti-theist to an atheist?"  said Donovan.
 "It was the horror of knowing that a little child's life  had been ruined by carelessness.
 I had been taught to believe in a  terrific phantom who was severely just; but when it seemed that the one  quality of justice was gone, then I took refuge in the conviction that  there could be no God at all.
 That WAS a refuge for the time, for it is  better to believe in no God than to believe in an immoral God and it was  long years before a better refuge found me.
 Yet, looking back now  over these seven-and-twenty years, I see how that one little child's  suffering has influenced countless lives! How it was just the most  beautiful thing that could have happened to her!"    Erica did not speak for a moment, she read half dreamily the words  engraved on the tombstone.
 Nearly sixteen years since that short,  uneventful life had passed into the unseen, and yet little Dot was at  this moment influencing the world's history.
    She was quite cheerful again as they walked home, and, indeed, her  relief about her father's recovery was so great that she could not be  unhappy for long about anything.
 They found Raeburn on the terrace with  Ralph and Dolly at his heels, and the two-year-old baby, who went by the  name of Pickle, on his shoulder.
    "I shall quite miss these bairnies," he said as Donovan joined them.
    "Gee up, horsey! Gee up!" shouted Pickle from his lofty perch.
    "And oh, daddy, may we go into Gleyshot wiv you?" said Dolly, coaxingly.
  "Elica's father's going to give me a playcat.
"    "And me a whip," interposed Ralph.
 "We may come with you, father, mayn't  we?"    "Oh! Yes," said Donovan, smiling; "if Mr. Raeburn doesn't mind a crowded  carriage.
"    Erica had gone into the house.
    "I don't know how to let you go," said Gladys, "We have so much enjoyed  having you.
 I think you had much better stay here will Monday and leave  those two to take care of themselves at Ashborough.
"    "Oh, no," said Erica, smiling, "that would never do! You don't realize  what an event this is to me.
 It is the first time father has spoken  since his illness.
 Besides, I have not yet quite learned to think him  well enough to look after himself though, of course, he is getting quite  strong again.
"    "Well, since you will go, come and choose a book for your journey," said  Gladys.
    "Oh, I should like that," said Erica; "a nice homish sort of book,  please, where the people lived in Arcadia and never heard of law  courts!"    Early in the afternoon they drove to Greyshot, stopping first of all at  the toy shop.
 Raeburn, who was in excellent spirits, fully entered  into the difficulties of Dolly's choice.
 At length a huge toy cat was  produced.
    "Oh, I should like that one!" said Dolly, clapping her hands.
 "What a  'normous, gleat big cat it is!"    "I shouldn't have known what it was meant for," said Raeburn,  scrutinizing the rather shapeless furry quadruped.
 "How is it that you  can't make them more like cats than this?"    "I don't know, sir, how it is," said the shopwoman; "we get very good  dogs and rabbits, and donkeys, but they don't seem to have attained to  the making of cats.
"    This view of the matter so tickled Raeburn that he left Ralph and Dolly  to see the "'normous gleat big cat" wrapped up, and went out of the shop  laughing.
    But just outside, a haggard, wild-looking man came up to him and began  to address him in excited tones.
    "You are the vile atheist, Luke Raeburn!" he cried, "Oh, I know you well  enough.
 I tell you, you have lost my son's soul; do you hear, wretched  infidel, you destroyed my son's soul! His guilt is upon you! And I will  have vengeance! Vengeance!"    "My friend," said Raeburn quietly, "supposing your son had what you call  a soul, do you think that I, a man, should be able to destroy it?"    "You have made him what you are yourself," cried the man, "an accursed  infidel, an incarnate devil! But I tell you I will have vengeance,  vengeance!"    "Have the goodness not to come so near my daughter," said Raeburn for  the man was pushing up roughly against Erica, who had just come out of  the shop.
 The words were spoken in such an authoritative manner that the  man shrunk back awed, and in another minute the children had rejoined  them, and they drove off to the station.
    "What was that man saying?" asked Erica.
    "Apparently his son has become a secularist, and he means to revenge  himself on me," said Raeburn.
 "If it wouldn't have lost me this train,  I would have given him in charge for using threatening language.
 But no  doubt the poor fellow was half-witted.
"    Donovan had walked on to the station and so had missed this incident,  and though for the time it saddened Erica, yet she speedily forgot it in  talking to the children.
 The arrival at Ashborough, too, was exciting,  and she was so delighted to see her father once more in the enjoyment  of full health and strength that she could not long be disquieted about  anything else.
 It was a great happiness to her to hear him speak upon  any subject on which they were agreed, and his reception that evening  at the Ashborough Town Hall was certainly a most magnificent one.
 The  ringing cheers made the tears start to her eyes.
 The people had been  roused by his late illness and, though many of them disliked his  theological views, they felt that in political matters he was a man whom  they could very ill spare.
 His speech was a remarkably powerful one, and  calculated to do great good.
 Erica's spirits rose to their very highest  pitch and, as they went back together to their hotel, she kept both  Raeburn and Donovan in fits of laughter.
 It was long months since her  father had seen her so brilliant and witty.
    "You are 'fey,' little one," he said.
 "I prophesy a headache for you  tomorrow.
"    And the prophecy came true for Erica awoke the next morning with a sense  of miserable oppression.
 The day, too, was gray and dreary-looking, it  seemed like a different world altogether.
 Raeburn was none the worse  for his exertions; he took a quiet day, however, went for a walk with  Donovan in the afternoon, and set off in good time for his evening  lecture.
 It was Sunday evening, Erica was going to church with Donovan,  and had her walking things on when her father looked into the room to  say goodbye.
    "What, going out?" he said.
 "You don't look fit for it, Eric.
"    "Oh!" she said, "it is no use to give way to this sort of headache; it's  only one's wretched nerves.
"    "Well, take carte of yourself," he said, kissing her.
 "I believe you  are worn out with all these weeks of attendance on a cantankerous old  father.
"    She laughed and brightened up, going out with him to the head of the  stairs, and returning to watch him from the window.
 Just as he left the  door of the hotel, a small child fell face downward on the pavement on  the opposite side of the road and began to cry bitterly.
 Raeburn crossed  over and picked up the small elf; they could hear him saying: "There,  there, more frightened than hurt, I think," as he brushed the dust from  the little thing's clothes.
    "How exactly like father!" said Erica, smiling; "he never would let us  think ourselves hurt.
 I believe it is thanks to him that Tom has grown  up such a Stoic, and that I'm not a very lachrymose sort of being.
"    A little later they started for church, but toward the end of the Psalms  Donovan felt a touch on his arm.
 He turned to Erica; she was a white as  death, and with a strange, glassy look in her eyes.
    "Come," she said in a hoarse whisper, "come out with me.
"    He thought she felt faint, but she walked steadily down the aisle.
 When  they were outside she grasped his arm and seemed to make a great effort  to speak naturally.
    "Forgive me for disturbing you," she said, "but I have such a dreadful  feeling that something is going to happen.
 I feel that I must go to my  father.
"    Donovan thought that she was probably laboring under a delusion.
 He knew  that she was always very anxious about her father and that Ashborough,  owing to various memories, was exactly the place where this anxiety  would be likely to weigh upon her.
 He thought, too, that Raeburn was  very likely right and that she was rather overdone by the strain of  those long weeks of solitary attendance.
 But he was much too wise to  attempt to reason away her fears; he knew that nothing but her father's  presence would set her at rest, and they walked as fast as they could to  the Town Hall.
 He was just turning down a street which led into the High  Street when Erica drew him instead in the direction of a narrow byway.
    "Down here," she said, walking straight on as though she held some  guiding clew in her hand.
    He was astonished as she could not possibly have been in this part of  the town before.
 Moreover, her whole bearing was very strange; she was  still pale and trembling, and her ungloved hands felt as cold as ice  while, although he had given her his arm, he felt all the time that she  was leading him.
    At length a sound of many voices was heard in the distance.
 Donovan felt  a sort of thrill pass through the hand that rested on his arm, and Erica  began to walk more quickly than ever.
 A minute more, and the little  byway led them out into the market place.
 It was lighted with the  electric light, and tonight the light was concentrated at one end, the  end at which stood the Town Hall.
 Instinctively Donovan's eyes were  turned at once toward that brightest point and also toward the sound,  the subdued roar of the multitude which they had heard on their way.
  There was another sound, too a man's ringing voice, a stentorian voice  which reached them clearly even at that distance.
 Raeburn stood alone,  facing an angry, tumultuous throng, with his back to the closed door  of the building and his tawny eyes scanning the mass of hostile faces  below.
    "Every Englishman has a right to freedom of speech.
 You shall not rob me  or any other man of a right.
 I have fought for this all my life, and I  will fight as long as I've breath.
"    "That shall not be long!" shouted another speaker.
 "Forward, brothers!  Down with the infidel! Vengeance, vengeance.
"    The haggard, wild-looking man who had addressed Raeburn the day before  at Greyshot now sprang forward; there was a surging movement in the  crowd like wind in a corn field.
 Donovan and Erica, hurrying forward,  saw Raeburn surrounded on every side, forced away from the door, and  at length half stunned by a heavy blow from the fanatical leader; then,  taken thus at a disadvantage, he was pushed backward.
 They saw him fall  heavily down the stone steps.
    With a low cry Erica rushed toward him, breaking away from Donovan and  forcing a way through that rough crowd as if by magic.
 Donovan, though  so much taller and stronger, was longer in reaching the foot of the  steps, and when at length he had pushed his way through the thickest  part of the throng he was hindered for the haggard-looking man who  had been the ringleader in the assault ran into his very arms.
 He was  evidently struck with horror at the result of his mad enterprise and now  meditated flight.
 But Donovan stopped him.
    "You must come with me, my friend," he exclaimed, seizing the fanatic by  the collar.
    Nor did he pause till he had handed him over to a policeman.
 Then once  more he forced a passage through the hushed crowd and at last reached  the foot of the steps.
 He found Erica on the ground with her father's  head raised on her knees.
 He was perfectly unconscious, but it seemed  as if his spirit and energy had been transmitted to his child.
 Erica  was giving orders so clearly and authoritatively that Donovan could only  marvel at her strength and composure.
    "Stand back!" she was saying as he approached.
 "How can he come to while  you are shutting out the air? Some one go quickly and fetch a door or a  litter.
 You go, and you.
"    She indicated two or three more respectable-looking men, and they at  once obeyed her.
 She looked relieved to see Donovan.
    "Won't you go inside and speak to the people?" she said.
 "I have sent  for a doctor.
 If some one doesn't go soon, they will come out, and then  there might be a riot.
 Tell them if they have any feeling for my father  to separate quietly.
 Don't let them all out upon these people; there is  sure to be fighting if they meet.
"    Donovan could not bear to leave her in such a position, but just then a  doctor came up, and the police began to drive back the crowd; and since  the people were rather awed by what had happened, they dispersed meekly  enough.
 Donovan went into the Town Hall then, and gradually learned what  had taken place.
 It seemed that soon after the beginning of Raeburn's  lecture, a large crowd had gathered outside, headed by a man  named Drosser, a street preacher, well-known in Ashborough and the  neighborhood.
 This crowd had stormed the doors of the hall and had  created such an uproar that it was impossible to proceed with the  lecture.
 The doors had been quite unequal to the immense pressure from  without, and Raeburn, foreseeing that they would give way and knowing  that, if the insurgents met his audience, there would be serious risk to  the lives of many, had insisted on trying to dismiss the crowd without,  or, at any rate, to secure some sort of order.
 Several had offered to go  with him, but he had begged the audience to keep still and had gone out  alone the crowd being so astonished by this unexpected move that they  fell back for a moment before him.
 Apparently his plan would have  succeeded very well had it not been for Drosser's deliberate assault.
 He  had gained a hearing from the people and would probably have dispersed  them had he not been borne down by brute force.
    It was no easy task to tell the audience what had happened; but Donovan  was popular and greatly respected and, thanks to his tact, their wrath,  though very great, was restrained.
 In fact, Raeburn was so well known  to disapprove of any sort of violence that Donovan's appeal to them  to preserve order for his sake met with a deep, suppressed murmur of  assent.
 When all was safe he hurried back to the hotel where they were  glad enough of his services.
 Raeburn had recovered his senses for a  minute but only to sink almost immediately into another swoon.
 For many  hours this went on; he would partly revive, even speak a few words,  and then sink back once more.
 Every time Erica thought it would end  in death, nor could she gather comfort from the looks of either of the  doctors or of Donovan.
    "This is not the first time I've been knocked down and trampled on,"  said Raeburn, faintly, in one of his intervals of consciousness, "but it  will be the last time.
"    And though the words were spoken with a touch of his native humor  and might have borne more than one interpretation, yet they answered  painfully to the conviction which lay deep in Erica's heart.
    "Then let me send a telegram from the 'Ashborough Times' office," said  Donovan to her in one of the momentary pauses.
 "I have sent for your  cousin and Mrs. Craigie and for Brian.
"    For the first time Erica's outward composure gave way.
 Her mouth began  to quiver and her eyes to fill.
    "Oh! Thank you," she said; and there was something in her voice that  went to Donovan's heart.
        .
 Mors Janua Vitae         Therefore to whom turn I but to Thee, the ineffable Name?       Builder and maker Thou, of houses not made with hands!       What, have fear of change from Thee who art ever the same?       Doubt that thy power can fill the heart that Thy power expands?         And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence       For the fullness of the days?  Have we withered or agonized?       Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence?       Why rushed the discords in, but that harmony should be prized?       R.
 Browning    Early on the Monday morning three anxious-looking travelers arrived by  the first train from London, and drove as fast as might be to the Park  Hotel at Ashborough.
 They were evidently expected for the moment their  cab stopped a door on one of the upper floors was opened, and some one  ran quickly down the stairs to meet them.
    "Is he better?" asked Aunt Jean.
    Erica shook her head and, indeed, her face told them much more than  the brief words of the telegram.
 She was deathly white, and had that  weighed-down look which people wear when they have watched all night  beside one who is hovering between life and death.
 She seemed to recover  herself a little as her hand rested for a moment in Brian's.
    "He has been asking for you," she said.
 "Do go to him.
 The faintness  has quite passed off, and they say inflammation has set in; he is in  frightful pain.
"    Her lips grew a shade whiter as she spoke and, with an effort, she  seemed to turn away from some horrible recollection.
    "There is some breakfast ready for you in here," she said to her aunt.
  "You must have something before you see him.
 Oh, I am so glad you have  come, auntie!"    Aunt Jean kissed her and cried a little; trouble always brought these  two together however much they disagreed at other times.
 Tom did not say  a word, but began to cut a loaf to pieces as though they had the  very largest appetites; the great pile of slices lay untouched on the  trencher, but the cutting had served its purpose of a relief to his  pent-up feelings.
    Later on there was a consultation of doctors; their verdict was perhaps  a little more hopeful than Erica had dared to expect.
 Her father had  received a fearful internal injury and was in the greatest danger, but  there was still a chance that he might recover, it was just possible;  and knowing how his constitution had rallied when every one had thought  him dying three years before, she grew very hopeful.
 Without hope she  could hardly have got through those days for the suffering was terrible.
  She hardly knew which she dreaded most, the nights of fever and delirium  when groans of anguish came from the writhing lips, or the days with  their clear consciousness when her father never uttered a word of  complaint but just silently endured the torture, replying always, if  questioned as to the pain, "It's bearable.
"    His great strength and vigor made it seem all the more piteous that he  should now be lying in the very extremity of suffering, unable to bear  even the weight of the bed clothes.
 But all through that weary time his  fortitude never gave way, and the vein of humor which had stood him in  such good stead all his life did not fail him even now.
 On the Monday  when he was suffering torments, they tried the application of leeches.
  One leech escaped, and they had a great hunt for it, Raeburn astonishing  them all by coming out with one of his quaint flashes of wit and  positively making them laugh in spite of their anxiety and sorrow.
    The weary days dragged on, the torture grew worse, opium failed to  deaden the pain, and sleep, except in the very briefest snatches, was  impossible.
 But at last on the Thursday morning a change set in, the  suffering became less intense; they knew, however, that it was only  because the end was drawing near and the life energy failing.
    For the second time Sir John Larkom came down from London to see the  patient, but every one knew that there was nothing to be done.
 Even  Erica began to understand that the time left was to be measured only  by hours.
 She learned it in a few words which Sir John Larkom said to  Donovan on the stairs.
 She was in her own room with the door partly  open, eagerly waiting for permission to go back to her father.
    "Oh, it's all up with the poor fellow," she heard the London doctor say.
  "A wonderful constitution; most men would not have held out so long.
"    At the time the words did not convey any very clear meaning to Erica;  she felt no very sharp pang as she repeated the sentence to herself;  there was only a curious numb feeling at her heart and a sort of dull  consciousness that she must move, must get away somewhere, do something  active.
 It was at first almost a relief to her when Donovan returned and  knocked at her door.
    "I am afraid we ought to come to the court," he said.
 "They will, I am  sure, take your evidence as quickly as possible.
"    She remembered then that the man Drosser was to be brought up before the  magistrates that morning; she and Donovan had to appear as witnesses of  the assault.
 She went into her father's room before she started; he  had specially asked to see her.
 He was quite clear-minded and calm,  and began to speak in a voice which, though weak and low, had the old  musical ring about it.
    "You are going to give evidence, Eric," he said, holding her hand in  his.
 "Now, I don't forgive that fellow for having robbed me of life, but  one must be just even to one's foes.
 They will ask you if you ever saw  Drosser before; you will have to tell them of that scene at Greyshot,  and you must be sure to say that I said, as we drove off: 'No doubt the  poor fellow is half-witted.
' Those were my words, do you remember?"    "Yes," she said, repeating the words after him at his request.
 "I  remember quite well.
"    "Those words may affect Drosser's case very much, and I don't wish any  man to swing for me I have always disapproved of the death penalty.
  Probably, though, it will be brought in as manslaughter yes, almost  certainly.
 There go, my child, and come back to me as soon as you can.
"    But the examination proved too much for Erica's physical powers; she was  greatly exhausted by the terrible strain of the long days and nights  of nursing, and when she found herself in a hot and crowded court,  pitilessly stared at, confronted by the man who was in fact her father's  murderer, and closely questioned by the magistrate about all the details  of that Sunday evening, her overtasked strength gave way suddenly.
    She had told clearly and distinctly about the meeting at Greyshot, and  had stated positively that in the Ashborough market place she had seen  Drosser give her father a heavy blow and then push him down the Town  Hall steps.
    "Can you recollect whether others pushed your father at the same time?"  asked the magistrate.
 "Don't answer hurriedly; this is an important  matter.
"    All at once the whole scene came vividly before Erica the huge crowd,  the glare of the lights, her father standing straight and tall, as she  should never see him again, his thick white hair stirred by the wind,  his whole attitude that of indignant protest; then the haggard face of  the fanatic, the surging movement in the black mass of people, and that  awful struggle and fall.
 Was it he who was falling? If so she was surely  with him, falling down, down, endlessly down.
    There was a sudden stir and commotion in the court, a murmur of pity,  for Luke Raeburn's daughter had fallen back senseless.
    When she came to herself, she was lying on the floor of an office-like  room, with her head on Mrs. MacNaughton's lap.
 Brian was bending over  her, chafing her hands.
 A clock in the building struck one, and the  sound seemed to recall things to her mind.
 She started up.
    "Oh!" she cried, "why am I not with my father? Where have you taken me  to?"    "It's all right, dear," said Mrs. MacNaughton soothingly; "you shall come  back directly you are well enough.
"    "I remember it all now," she said; "did I finish? Must I go back there?"    It was some relief to know that Donovan had been able to supplement her  evidence, and that the examination was in fact over, Drosser having been  remanded for a week.
 She insisted on going back to the hotel at once,  and spent the whole of the afternoon and evening with her father.
 He was  not in great pain now, but very restless, and growing weaker every hour.
  He was able, however, to see several of his friends, and though the  farewells evidently tried him, he would not refuse to see those who had  come hundreds of miles for that last glimpse.
    "What does it matter if I am exhausted?" he said when some one  remonstrated with him.
 "It will make no difference at all as far as I  am concerned, and it will be a happiness to them for the rest of their  lives.
 Besides, I shall not die today, perhaps not tomorrow; depend upon  it, I shall die hard.
"    They persuaded Erica to rest for the first part of the night.
 She left  Tom and Brian to watch, and went to her room, making them promise to  call her if there were any signs of change.
    At last the full realization had come to her; though she hated leaving  her father, it was yet a sort of relief to get away into the dark, to be  able to give way for a moment.
    "Anything but this, oh, God," she sobbed, "anything but this!"    All else would have been easy enough to bear, but that he should be  killed by the violence and bigotry of one who at any rate called himself  a Christian, this seemed to her not tolerable.
 The hope of years had  received its death blow, the life she most loved was sinking away in  darkness, the work which she had so bravely taken as her life work was  all but over, and she had failed.
 Yes, in spite of all her efforts, all  her longings, all her love, she had failed, or at any rate apparently  failed, and in moments of great agony we do not in fact can not  distinguish between the real and the apparent.
 Christ Himself could not  do it.
    She did not dare to let her sobs rise for it was one of the trials of  that time that they were not in their own home but in a busy hotel where  the partitions were thin and every sound could be heard in the adjoining  rooms.
 Moreover, Aunt Jean was sleeping with her and must not be  disturbed.
 But as she lay on the floor, trying to stifle the restrained  sobs which shook her from head to foot trying to check the bitter tears  which would come, her thoughts were somehow lifted quite away from the  present; strange little memories of her childish days returned to her,  days when her father had been to her the living incarnation of all that  was noble and good.
 Often it is not the great events of a child's life  which are so vividly remembered; memory seems to be strangely capricious  and will single out some special word or deed, some trifling sign of  love which has stamped itself indelibly upon the grain to bear its  golden harvest of responding love through a life time.
 Vividly there  came back to her now the eager happiness with which she had awaited a  long promised treat, as a little thing of seven years old.
 Her father  was to take her on some special excursion, she had long ago forgotten  what the particular occasion was, only it was something that could come  but once, the day lost, the treat would be lost.
 But the evening before,  when she was on the very tiptoe of expectation, a celebrated action for  libel had come to an end much sooner than was expected, and when her  father returned in the evening he had to tell her that his case was to  come on the next day, and that he could not possibly take her.
 Even  now she could recall the bitterness of the disappointment, but not so  vividly as the look in her father's face as he lifted her off the floor  where she had thrown herself in the abandonment of her grief.
 He had  not said a word then about the enormity of crying, he had just held her  closely in his arms, feeling the disappointment a thousand times more  than she felt it herself, and fully realizing that the loss of such a  long-looked-for happiness was to a child what the loss of thousands of  pounds would be to a man.
 He had been patient with her though she had  entirely failed to see why he could not put off the case just for that  day.
    "You'll understand one day, little one," he had said, "and be glad that  you have had your share of pain in a day that will advance the cause of  liberty.
"    She remembered protesting that that was impossible, that she should  always be miserable; at which he had only smiled.
    Then it came to Erica that the life upon earth was, after all, as  compared with the eternal life, what the day is in the life of a child.
  It seemed everything at the time, but was in truth such a fragment.
 And  as she lay there in the immeasurably greater agony of later life, once  more sobbing: "I had hoped, I had planned, this is more than I can  bear!" a Comforter infinitely grater, a Father whose love was infinitely  stronger, drew her so near that the word "near" was but a mockery, and  told her, as the earthly father had told her with such perfect truth:  "One day you will understand, child; one day you will be glad to have  shared the pain!"    In the next room there was for some time quiet.
 Poor Tom, heavy with  grief and weariness, fell asleep beside the fire; Raeburn was for the  most part very still as if wrapped in thought.
 At length a heavy sigh  made Brian ask if he were in pain.
    "Pain of mind," he said, "not of body.
 Don't misunderstand me," he  said after a pause, with the natural fear least Brian should fancy his  secularism failed him at the near approach of death.
 "For myself I am  content; I have had a very full life, and I have tried always yes, I  think I may say always--to work entirely for the good of Humanity.
 But  I am wretched about Erica.
 I do not see how the home can be a very happy  one for her when I am gone.
"    For a minute Brian hesitated; but it seemed to him when he thought out  the matter, that a father so loving as Raeburn would find no jealousy at  the thought that the love he had deemed exclusively his own might, after  all, have been given to another.
    "I do not know whether I am right to tell you," he said.
 "Would it make  you happier to know that I love Erica that I have loved her for nearly  nine years?"    Raeburn gave an ejaculation of astonishment.
 There was a long silence;  for the idea, once suggested to him, he began to see what a likely thing  it was and to wonder that he had not thought of it before.
    "I think you are well suited to each other," he said at last.
 "Now  I understand your visit to Florence.
 What took you away again so  suddenly?"    Brian told him all about the day at Fiesole.
 He seemed greatly touched;  all the little proofs and coincidences which had never struck him at  the time were so plain now.
 They were still discussing it when, at  about five o'clock, Erica returned.
 She was pale and sad, but the worn,  harassed, miserable look had quite gone.
 It was a strange time and place  for a betrothal.
    "Brian has been telling me about the day at Fiesole," said Raeburn,  letting his weak, nerveless hands play about in her hair as she knelt  beside the bed.
 "You have been a leal bairn to me, Eric; I don't think  I could have spared you then even though Brian so well deserved you.
 But  now it makes me very happy to leave you to him; it takes away my only  care.
"    Erica had colored faintly, but there was an absence of responsiveness in  her manner which troubled Raeburn.
    "You do still feel as you did at Fiesole?" he asked.
 "You are sure of  your own mind? You think you will be happy?"    "I love Brian," she said in a low voice.
 "But, oh, I can't think now  about being happy!" She broke off suddenly and hid her face in the bed  clothes.
    There was silence in the room.
 In a minute she raised herself and turned  to Brian who stood beside her.
    "You will understand," she said, looking right into his eyes.
 "There is  only one thing that I can feel just now.
 You do understand, I know.
"    With a sudden impulse she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him.
    And Brian did understand.
 He knew, too, that she wanted to have her  father to herself.
 Even in the very fulfillment of his desire he was  obliged to stand aside, obliged even yet to be patient.
 Never surely had  an impulsive, impetuous man a longer training.
    When he had gone Raeburn talked for some time of Erica's future, talked  for so long, indeed, that she grew impatient.
 How trifling now seemed  the sacrifice she had made at Fiesole to which he kept on referring.
    "Oh, why do you waste the time in talking of me?" she said at last.
    "Why?" he said smiling.
 "Because you are my bairn of what else should  I speak or think? For myself, I am very content, dear, though I should  have liked a few more years of work.
 It was not to be, you see; and, in  the end, no doubt this will work good to the cause of--" he broke off,  unwilling to pain her.
    "Ah, child!" he said after a pause, "How miserable you and I might have  been for these two years if we had not loved each other.
 You are not to  think, little one, that I have not known what your wishes have been for  me.
 You, and Brian, and Osmond, and of late that noble fellow Farrant,  have often made me see that Christianity need not necessarily warp the  intellect and cripple the life.
 I believe that for you, and such as  you, the system is not rooted in selfishness.
 But, dear, you are but the  exceptions, the rare exceptions.
 I know that you have wished with all  your heart that I should come to think as you do, while I have been  wishing you back into the ranks of secularism.
 Well! It wasn't to be.
 We  each of us lost our wish.
 But there is this left, that we each know the  other to be honest; each deem it a case of honest mistake.
 I've felt  that all along.
 We've a common love of truth and a common love of  humanity.
 Oh, my child! Spite of all the creeds, we are very near to  each other!"    "Very near," she whispered.
 And words which Charles Osmond had spoken  years ago returned to her memory.
 "I think death will be your gate of  life.
 You will wake up and exclaim: 'Who'd have thought it?'"    After all, death would in a sense make them yet nearer! But human nature  is weak, and it is hard for us to realize the Unseen.
 She could not  then feel that it was anything but hard, bitter, heart-breaking that he  should be leaving her in this way.
    The pain had now almost entirely ceased, and Raeburn, though very  restless, was better able to talk than on the previous day.
 He asked for  the first time what was passing in the world, showed special interest in  the accounts of the late colliery accident, and was greatly touched  by the gallant efforts of the rescuers who had to some extent been  successful.
 He insisted, too, on hearing what the various papers had  to say about his own case, listening sometimes with a quiet smile,  sometimes with a gleam of anger in his eyes.
 After a very abusive  article, which he had specially desired to hear, he leaned back with an  air of weariness.
    "I'm rather tired of this sort of thing!" he said with a sigh.
 "What  will the 'Herald' do when it no longer has me to abuse?"    Of Drosser and of the events of that Sunday evening he spoke strangely  little.
 What he did say was, for the most part, said to Professor Gosse.
    "You say I was rash to go alone," he replied when the professor had  opened the subject.
 "Well, that may be.
 It is not, perhaps, the first  time that in personal matters I've been lacking in due caution.
 But I  thought it would prevent a riot.
 I still think it did so.
"    "And what is your feeling about the whole matter?" asked the professor.
  "Do you forgive Drosser for having given you this mortal injury?"    "One must bow to necessity," said Raeburn quietly.
 "When you speak of  forgiving I don't quite understand you; but I don't intend to hand down  a legacy of revenge to my successors.
 The law will duly punish the man,  and future atheists will reap the benefit of my death.
 There is, after  all, you know, a certain satisfaction in feeling that I died as I have  lived, in defending the right of free speech.
 I can't say that I could  not have wished that Drosser had made an end of me at nine-and-seventy  rather than at nine-and-forty.
 I shall live on in their hearts, and that  is a glorious immortality! The only immortality I have ever looked for.
"    In the afternoon to the astonishment of all, Mr. Fane-Smith came over  from Greyshot, horrified to hear that the man who he had once treated  with scant justice and actual discourtesy was lying on his death bed,  a victim to religious fanaticism.
 Spite of his very hard words to her,  Erica had always respected Mr. Fane-Smith, and she was glad that he had  come at the last.
 Her aunt had not come; she had hesitated long, but in  the end the recollection that Greyshot would be greatly scandalized, and  that, too, on the very eve of her daughter's wedding turned the scale.
  She sent affectionate messages and a small devotional book, but stayed  at home.
    Mr. Fane-Smith apologized frankly and fully to Raeburn for his former  discourtesy and then plunged at once into eager questions and eager  arguments.
 He could not endure the thought that the man in whom at the  last he was able to recognize a certain nobility of character, should be  sinking down into what he considered everlasting darkness.
 Bitterly  did he now regret the indifference of former years, and the actual  uncharitableness in which he had of late indulged.
    Raeburn lay very passively listening to an impassioned setting forth of  the gospel, his hands wandering about restlessly, picking up little bits  of the coverlet in that strange way so often noticed in dying people.
    "You are mistaken," he said when at length Mr. Fane-Smith ceased.
 "Had  you argued with me in former years, you would never have convinced me,  your books and tracts could never have altered my firm convictions.
  All my life I have had tracts and leaflets showered down upon me with  letters from pious folks desiring my conversion.
 I have had innumerable  letters telling me that the writers were praying for me.
 Well, I think  they would have done better to pray for some of my orthodox opponents  who are leading immoral lives; but, insofar as prayers show a certain  amount of human interest, I am very willing that they should pray for me  though they would have shown better taste if they had not informed me  of their supplications.
 But don't mistake me; it is not in this way that  you will ever prove the truth of your religion.
 You must show justice  to your opponents first.
 You must put a different spirit into your pet  word, 'Charity.
' I don't think you can do it.
 I think your religion  false.
 I consider that it is rooted in selfishness and superstition.
  Being convinced of this when I was still young, I had to find some other  system to take its place.
 That system I found in secularism.
 For thirty  years I have lived as a secularist and have been perfectly content  notwithstanding that my life has been a very hard one.
 As a secularist I  now die content.
"    Mr. Fane-Smith shuddered.
 This was of course inexpressibly painful to  him.
 He could not see that what had disgusted Raeburn with religion  had been the distortion of Christ's teaching, and that in truth the  secularist creed embodied much of the truest and loftiest Christianity.
    Once more he reiterated his arguments, striving hard to show by words  the beauty of his religion.
 But Christianity can only be vindicated  by deeds, can only be truly shown forth in lives.
 The country, the  "Christian Country," as it was fond of styling itself, had had thirty  years in which to show to Raeburn the loving kindness, the brotherhood,  the lofty generosity which each professed follower of Christ ought to  show in his life.
 Now the time was over, and it was too late.
    The dying man bent forward, and a hard look came into his eyes, and a  sternness overspread his calm face.
    "What has Christianity done for me?" he asked.
 "Look at my life.
 See how  I have been treated.
"    And Mr. Fane-Smith was speechless.
 Conscience-stricken, he knew that  to this there was no reply that HE could honestly make, and a question  dawned upon his mind Was his own "Christianity" really that of Christ?    As evening drew on, Raeburn's life was slowly ebbing away.
 Very slowly,  for to the last he fought for breath.
 All his nearest friends were  gathered round him, and to the end he was clearly conscious and, as in  life, calmly philosophical.
    "I have been well 'friended' all my life," he said once, looking round  at the faces by his bedside.
    They were all too broken-hearted to respond, and there were long  silences, broken only by the laboring breath and restless movements of  the dying man.
    Toward midnight there was a low roll of distant thunder, and gradually  the storm drew nearer and nearer.
 Raeburn asked to be raised in bed that  he might watch the lightning which was unusually beautiful.
 It was a  strange, weird scene the plainly furnished hotel room, sparsely lighted  by candles, the sad group of watchers, the pale, beautiful face of the  young girl bending over the pillow, and the strong, rugged Scotchman  with his white hair and keen brown eyes, upon whose face death had  already set his pale tokens.
 From the uncurtained window could be seen  the dark outline of the adjacent houses and the lights lower down the  hill scattered here and there throughout the sleeping city.
 Upon all  this the vivid lightning played, and the distant thunder followed with  its mighty crash, rolling and echoing away among the surrounding hills.
    "I am glad to have seen one more storm," said Raeburn.
    But soon he grew weary, tired just with the slight exertion of looking  and listening.
 He sighed.
 To a strong, healthy man in the very prime of  life, this failing of the powers was hard to bear.
 Death was very near;  he knew it well enough knew it by this slow, sure, painless sinking.
    He held Erica's hand more closely, and after that lay very still, once  or twice asking for more coverings over his feet.
 The night wore on.
  After a long silence, he looked up once more and said to Tom:    "I promised Hazeldine a sovereign toward the fund for--" he broke off  with a look of intense weariness, adding after an interval "He'll tell  you.
 See that it's paid.
"    The storm had passed, and the golden-red dawn was just breaking when  once more the silence was broken.
    "Come nearer, Eric," he whispered "nearer!"    Then came a long pause.
    There was stillness that fearful stillness when the watchers begin to  hush their very breath, that they may catch the last faint breathings.
  Poor Tom could stand it no longer; he just buried his face in his hands  and sobbed.
 Perhaps Erica envied him.
 Violent grief would surely have  been more endurable than this terrible sinking, this dread of not  keeping up to the end.
 Was she falling with him down those horrible  steps? Was she sinking with him beneath the cold, green waves? Oh, death  cruel death! Why had he not taken them together on that summer day?    Yet what was she saying? The death angel was but God's messenger, and  her father could never, never be beyond the care of One who loved him  infinitely eternally.
 If He the Father were taking him from her, why,  she would trust Him, though it should crush her whole world.
    "Nearer, Eric nearer.
" How those last words rang in her ears as she  waited there with her hands in his.
 She knew they would be the last for  he was sinking away into a dreamily passive state just dying because too  tired to live.
    "Nearer, nearer!" Was this agony indeed to heal the terrible division  between them? Ah, mystery of evil, mystery of pain, mystery of death!  Only the love of the Infinitely Loving can fathom you only the trust in  that Love give us a glimpse of your meaning.
    She felt a tightening of the fingers that clasped hers.
 He was still  conscious; he smiled just such a smile as he used to give her when, as a  little thing, she had fretted about his leaving home.
    She pressed her quivering lips to his, clung to him, and kissed him  again and again.
 There was a sigh.
 A long interval, and another sigh.
  After that, silence.
        .
 Results Closely Following         But that one man should die ignorant who had capacity for       knowledge, this I call a tragedy.
  Carlyle    Not what I think, but what Thou art, makes sure.
 George MacDonald    A wave of strangely varied feeling swept through the country in the next  four-and-twenty hours.
    From the Raeburnites came a burst of mingled wrath and grief, and a  bitter outcry against the religion which inevitably they thought tended  to produce such fanatics as Drosser.
 From the poor and oppressed came a  murmur of blank despair; they had looked upon Raeburn as the deliverer  from so much that now weighed upon them, and were so perfectly conscious  that he understood their wants and difficulties in a way which others  failed to do, that his death in the very prime of manhood simply stunned  them.
 The liberal-minded felt a thrill of horror and indignation at  the thought that such deeds as this could take place in the nineteenth  century; realizing, however, with a shudder that the rash act of the  ignorant fanatic was, in truth, no worse than the murder of hatred, the  perpetual calumny and injustice which thousands of professing Christians  had meted out to Raeburn.
 In nothing had the un-Christlikeness of the  age been more conspicuous than in the way in which Raeburn had all his  life been treated.
    The fashionable world felt a sort of uncomfortableness.
 The news reached  them at their laziest time of year; they came in from shooting parties  to read the account in the papers; they discussed it in ball rooms  and at evening parties at Brighton and Greyshot and the other autumnal  resorts.
 "So he was dead! Well, really they were tired of hearing his  name! It was rather horrible, certainly, that his daughter should have  seen it all, but such infamous creatures as Raeburn had no business  to have daughters.
 No doubt she would stand it very well anything, you  know, for a little notoriety.
 Such people lived for notoriety.
 Of course  the papers had put in a lot of twaddle that he had said on his death bed  'always had tried to work entirely for the good of humanity,' and that  sort of nonsense.
 This coffee ice is excellent.
 Let me get you another,"  after which the subject would be dropped, and the speakers would return  to the ball room to improve upon Raeburn's life, which they presumed so  severely to criticize, by a trois temps enlivened by a broad flirtation.
    Here and there a gleam of good was effected inasmuch as some of the  excessively narrow began to see what narrowness leads to.
 Mr. Cuthbert,  coming home from his annual Swiss tour, was leaning back sleepily in  a first-class carriage at the Folkestone station when the voice of a  newsboy recalled him to the every-day world with a slight shock.
 There  was the usual list of papers; he was sleepy and thought he would not get  one, but then came the loud voice, not a couple of yards from his ear,  "Death of Mr. Raeburn! Death of Luke Raeburn this da-ay!"    Mr. Cuthbert had his head out of the window in a moment.
    "Here, paper!"    "These boys will call anything to sell their papers," he remarked to his  companion; "I dare say it's nothing more than a rumor.
"    "Precious good thing for the country if it was true," replied the other,  a young fellow of two-and-twenty who dawdled through life upon an income  of 5,000 pounds a year, and found it quite possible to combine the  enjoyment of lax living with the due expression of very orthodox  sentiments.
    Mr. Cuthbert did not answer; his eye was traveling down a column of the  newspaper, and he felt a curious pricking of remorse as he read.
 He had  once been rude to Erica Raeburn; he had all his life retailed dubious  stories about her father, knowing all the time that had any one believed  such stories of himself upon such shaky evidence, he would have used  very strong language about them.
 And now this fellow was dead! Curiously  enough, Mr. Cuthbert, who had many times remarked that "Raeburn ought  to be shut up, or better still, hung," was now the one to wish him alive  again.
 Ugh! It was a horrible story.
 He quite shivered as he read the  account of those days of torture.
    But in a room at the Park Hotel, Ashborough, two very different men were  discussing the same subject.
 Mr. Fane-Smith, with all his faults, had  always been well-intentioned, and though frightful harm may be done by  people with good intentions, they can never stand upon the same level  as those who wilfully and maliciously offend.
 All too plainly now he saw  how grievously he had failed with regard to Raeburn, and patiently did  he listen to Donovan's account of the really good work which Raeburn had  effected in many instances.
    "Much as you may hate his views, you must at least see that, as some one  has well expressed it, 'It takes a high-souled man to move the masses  even to a cleaner sty.
' And I say that a man who worked as he worked,  striving hard to teach the people to live for the general good,  advocating temperance, promoting the spread of education, and somehow  winning those whom no one else had ever touched to take an intelligent  interest in politics, in science, and in the future of the race, that  such a man claims our respect however much we may disagree with him.
"    "But that he should have died ignorant like this!" exclaimed Mr.  Fane-Smith with a shudder.
    "'Tis in truth a tragedy," said Donovan, sighing.
 "But I can well  believe that in another world the barriers which he allowed to distort  his vision will be removed; the very continuance of existence would  surely be sufficient.
"    "You are a universalist?" said Mr. Fane-Smith, not in the condemnatory  tone he would once have assumed, but humbly, anxiously, like one who  gropes his way in a dark place.
    "Yes," replied Donovan.
 "Believing in a universal Father, I am naturally  that.
 Upon any other system, what do you make of the good which exists  in so many of those who deny all in which you believe? Where does the  good go to? I stood beside the death bed of that noble man this morning.
  At the very last I saw most touching proofs of his strong sense of  justice, his honesty, his desire to promote the good of others, his  devotion to his child.
 Can you believe that all that goodness, which of  necessity comes from God, is to go down into what you call everlasting  punishment? Don't mistake me.
 Thank God there is a punishment which no  one would wish to forego, such punishment, such drawing forth of the  native good, such careful help in the rooting out of what is evil as all  good fathers give to their children.
"    They were interrupted by the opening of the door.
 Mr. Fane-Smith started  and almost trembled when, on turning round, he saw Erica.
 She was pale,  but preternaturally calm looking, however, they all felt, as if in her  father's death, she had received her own death blow.
    "I thought I heard you," she said in that strangely "gravened" voice  which is sometimes one of the consequences of great and sudden trouble.
  "Has Donovan taken you into the next room? Will you come?"    For his life Mr. Fane-Smith could not have refused anything which she  asked him; there was something in her manner that made the tears rush to  his eyes though he was not, as a rule, easily moved.
    He followed her obediently though with a sort of reluctance; but when he  was once there he was glad.
 Ever since the previous day he had not been  able to rid himself of that stern, hard look with which Raeburn had so  terribly rebuked him; it had persistently haunted him.
 There was nothing  stern in this dead face.
 It was still and passionless, bearing the  look of repose which, spite of a harassed life, it had always borne in  moments of leisure.
 He hardly looked as though he were dead.
 Erica could  almost have fancied that he was but resting after the toils of a hard  day, having fallen asleep for a few minutes, as she had often seen him  in his arm chair on a Sunday evening.
    Mr. Fane-Smith did not say a word, his eyes wandered from the calm face  to the still hands which clasped some sprigs of his native heather, the  heather which Donovan's children had sent only the day before, but just  in time to win one of his last smiles.
 Donovan and Erica spoke together  in low tones, but something in the sound of that "gravened" voice  arrested Mr. Fane-Smith's attention.
 He had not heard what had passed  before, and there was nothing special in the words that fell now upon  his ear; it was rather that his own soul was in a state of receptivity,  and so through the first channel that came to hand he was able to  receive a new truth.
    "I am only his child; God is his Father.
"    And there, by the lifeless body of Luke Raeburn, one, who during his  life had judged him with the very hardest judgment, learned for the  first time what Fatherhood means.
    As long as there was anything to be done, Erica struggled on although  the days were terribly hard and were rendered infinitely harder by  the sort of publicity which attended them.
 There was the necessity of  appearing at the inquest; there was the necessity of reading every  word that was written about her father.
 She could not help reading the  papers, could not keep her hands off them, though even now most cruel  things were said.
 There was the necessity of attending the great public  funeral in London, of seeing the thousands of grief-stricken people, of  listening to the professor's words so broken with sobs that they could  hardly be heard.
 A week later there was the necessity of going down to  the Ashborough assizes to appear as a witness in the trial of Drosser.
    "What do you feel toward this man?" some one asked her once.
    "A great pity," she replied.
 "It is not nearly so hard for me to forgive  this poor fanatic as to forgive those who have taught him his dark  creed, or to forgive those who, while calling themselves Christians,  have hated my father with the hatred that is quite as bad as murder.
"    But when the trial was over and there was no longer any necessity to  do anything, Erica suddenly broke down.
 She had never till now yielded  though not a night had passed in which she had not been haunted by the  frightful recollections of that Sunday evening and the days following.
  But the evening she returned from Ashborough she could hold out no  longer.
    Very quietly she bore that sad return to the empty house, going into all  the familiar rooms and showing no sign of grief, because those she loved  were with her, watching her with the anxious solicitude which people  cannot help showing at such a time though it is usually more of a trial  than a comfort.
 Erica longed inexpressibly to be alone, and when at  length, deceived by her unnatural calm, they were persuaded to leave  her, she crept down to the study and shut herself in, and no longer  tried to resist the inevitable, the mere surroundings were quite  sufficient to open the flood gates of her grief; the books which her  father had loved, the table, the empty chair, the curious cactus which  they had brought back from Italy, and in the growth of which they had  taken such an interest! the desk at which her father had toiled for  so many long years.
 She hid her face from the light and broke into a  passionate fit of weeping.
 Then exhausted, nerveless, powerless, she  could no longer cope with that anguish of remembrance which was her  nightly torment.
 Once more there rose before her that horrible scene in  the Ashborough market place; once more she could see the glare of light,  the huge crowd, the sudden treacherous movement, the fall; once more she  heard the crash, the hushed murmur; once more felt the wild struggle to  get through that pushing, jostling throng that she might somehow reach  him.
 That nightmare recollection only gave place to a yet more painful  one, to the memory of days of such agony that to recall them was almost  to risk her reason.
 She had struggled bravely not to dwell upon these  things, but this night her strength was gone, she could do nothing, and  Brian, coming at last to seek her, found that the climax he had long  foreseen had come.
    "Oh," she sobbed, "if you love me, Brian, be willing to let me go! Don't  pray for me to live! Promise that you will not!"    A shade came over Brian's face.
 Was the dead father still to absorb all  her love? Must he even now resign all to him? Lose Erica at last after  these long years of waiting! There was a look of agony in his eyes, but  he answered quietly and firmly:    "I will pray only that God's will may be done, darling.
"    A sort of relief was apparent in Erica's flushed, tear-stained face as  though he had given her leave to be ill.
    After that, for long, weary weeks, she lay at the very gate of death,  and those who watched by her had not the heart to wish her back to life  again.
        .
 A New Year's Dawn         And the murky planets, I perceived, were but cradles for the       infant spirits of the universe of light.
.
.
.
  And in sight       of this immeasurability of life no sadness could endure.
.
.
.
       And I exclaimed, Oh!  How beautiful is death, seeing that       we die in a world of life and of creation without end! And I       blessed God for my life upon earth, but much more for the       life in those unseen depths of the universe which are       comprised of all but the Supreme Reality, and where no       earthly life or perishable hope can enter.
 Richter    For many weeks Erica had scarcely a conscious interval.
 Now and then she  had been dimly aware that Brian was in the room, or that Aunt Jean, and  Mrs. MacNaughton, and her many secularist friends were nursing her; but  all had been vague, dream-like, seen through the distorting fever-mist.
  On night, however, she woke after a sleep of many hours to see things  once more as they really were.
 There was her little room with its  green-paneled walls, and its familiar pictures, and familiar books.
  There was Aunt Jean sitting beside the fire, turning over the pages of  an "Idol-Breaker," while all the air seemed to be ringing and echoing  with the sound of church bells.
    "Auntie," she said, "what day is it?"    Aunt Jean came at once to her bedside.
    "It is New Year's day," she said; "it struck twelve about five minutes  ago, dear.
"    Erica made no comment though the words brought back to her the sense of  her desolation brought back to her, too, the remembrance of another New  Year's day long ago when she had stood beside her father on the deck of  the steamer, and the bells of Calais had gayly pealed in spite of her  grief.
 She took the food her aunt brought her, and promised to go to  sleep once more.
    "I shall have to wake up again in this misery!" she thought to herself.
  "Oh, if one could only sleep right on!"    But God sometimes saves us from what we have most dreaded; and when at  sunrise Erica woke once more, before any recollection returned to her  mind, she became conscious of One who said to her, "Lo, I am with you  always! Behold, I make all things new!"    Streaks of golden light were stealing in between the window curtains.
  She lay quite still, able to face life once more in the strength of that  Inner Presence; able to endure the well-known sights and sounds because  she could once more realize that there was One who made even "the wrath  of man to praise" Him; who, out of blackest evil and cruelest pain,  could at length bring good.
 Presently, passing from the restfulness of  that conscious communion, she remembered a strange dream she had had  that night.
    She had dreamed that she was sitting with Donovan in the little church  yard at Oakdene; in her hand she held a Greek Testament, but upon the  page had only been able to see one sentence.
 It ran thus, "Until the  times of the Restitution of all things.
" Donovan had insisted that  the word should rightly be "restoration.
" She had clung to the old  rendering.
 While they discussed the distinction between the words,  a beautiful girl had all at once stood before them.
 Erica knew in an  instant who it must be by the light which shone in her companion's face.
    "You are quite right," she had said, turning her beautiful eyes upon  him.
 "It is not the mere giving back of things that were, it is the  perfecting of that which was here only in ideal; it is the carrying out  of what might have been.
 All the time there has been progress, all the  time growth, and so restoration is better, wider, grander than anything  we could dream of here!"    And, as she left them, there had come to both a sort of vision of the  Infinite, in sight of which the whole of earthly existence was but as  an hour, and the sum of human suffering but as the pin prick to a strong  man, and yet both human suffering and human existence were infinitely  worth while.
 And over them stole a wonderful peace as they realized  the greatness of God's universe, and that in it was no wasted thing,  no wasted pain, but order where there seemed confusion, and a soul of  goodness where there seemed evil.
    And, after all, what was this dream compared with the reality which she  knew to exist? Well, it was perhaps a little fragment, a dim shadow, a  seeing through the glass darkly; but mostly it was a comfort because she  was all the time conscious that there was an infinitely Better which it  has not entered into the heart of man to conceive.
    Brian came in for his morning visit with a face so worn and anxious that  it made her smile.
    "Oh!" she said, looking up at him with quiet, shining eyes, "how I have  been troubling you all these weeks! But you are not to be troubled any  more, darling.
 I am going to get better.
"    And with a sort of grateful, loving tenderness, she drew his face down  to hers and kissed him.
    "Where is Tom?" she asked presently, beginning for the first time to  take an interest in the world again.
    "Tom has gone to Oakdene for a day or two," said Brian.
 "He is going to  be Donovan's private secretary.
"    "How glad I am!" she said.
 "Dear old Tom, he does so deserve to be  happy!"    "They want you to go there as soon as you are well enough to be moved,"  said Brian.
    "I should like that," she said with a touch of her old eagerness of  manner.
 "I want to get well quickly; there is so much work for us to do  you know.
 Oh, Brian! I feel that there is work which HE would wish me to  do, and I'm so glad, so glad to be left to do it!"    Brian thought of the enormous impetus given to the cause of secularism  by Raeburn's martyrdom.
 The momentary triumph of bigotry and intolerance  had, as in all other ages, been followed by this inevitable consequence  a dead loss to the persecuting side.
 Would people at length learn the  lesson? Would the reign of justice at length dawn? Would the majority  at length believe that the All Father needs not to be supported by  persecuting laws and unjust restrictions?    Yet it was not these thoughts which brought the tears to his eyes it was  the rapture caused by Erica's words.
    "My darling will live, and is glad to live!" he thought.
 "Who could bear  witness to the truth so well? Who be so sweet a reconciler?"    "Why, Brian! Brian!" exclaimed Erica as the great drops fell on her hand  lying clasped in his.
    And there was that in tone and look and touch which made Brian more than  content.
            End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of We Two, by Edna Lyall    .
         Produced by An Anonymous Volunteer            "PIGS IS PIGS"    By Ellis Parker Butler          Mike Flannery, the Westcote agent of the Interurban Express Company,  leaned over the counter of the express office and shook his fist.
  Mr. Morehouse, angry and red, stood on the other side of the counter,  trembling with rage.
 The argument had been long and heated, and at last  Mr. Morehouse had talked himself speechless.
 The cause of the trouble  stood on the counter between the two men.
 It was a soap box across  the top of which were nailed a number of strips, forming a rough but  serviceable cage.
 In it two spotted guinea-pigs were greedily eating  lettuce leaves.
    "Do as you loike, then!" shouted Flannery, "pay for thim an' take  thim, or don't pay for thim and leave thim be.
 Rules is rules, Misther  Morehouse, an' Mike Flannery's not goin' to be called down fer breakin'  of thim.
"    "But, you everlastingly stupid idiot!" shouted Mr. Morehouse, madly  shaking a flimsy printed book beneath the agent's nose, "can't you read  it here-in your own plain printed rates? 'Pets, domestic, Franklin to  Westcote, if properly boxed, twenty-five cents each.
'" He threw the book  on the counter in disgust.
 "What more do you want? Aren't they pets?  Aren't they domestic? Aren't they properly boxed? What?"    He turned and walked back and forth rapidly; frowning ferociously.
    Suddenly he turned to Flannery, and forcing his voice to an artificial  calmness spoke slowly but with intense sarcasm.
    "Pets," he said "P-e-t-s! Twenty-five cents each.
 There are two of them.
  One! Two! Two times twenty-five are fifty! Can you understand that? I  offer you fifty cents.
"    Flannery reached for the book.
 He ran his hand through the pages and  stopped at page sixty four.
    "An' I don't take fifty cints," he whispered in mockery.
 "Here's the  rule for ut.
 'Whin the agint be in anny doubt regardin' which of two  rates applies to a shipment, he shall charge the larger.
 The con-sign-ey  may file a claim for the overcharge.
' In this case, Misther Morehouse,  I be in doubt.
 Pets thim animals may be, an' domestic they be, but pigs  I'm blame sure they do be, an' me rules says plain as the nose on  yer face, 'Pigs Franklin to Westcote, thirty cints each.
' An' Mister  Morehouse, by me arithmetical knowledge two times thurty comes to sixty  cints.
"    Mr. Morehouse shook his head savagely.
 "Nonsense!" he shouted,  "confounded nonsense, I tell you! Why, you poor ignorant foreigner, that  rule means common pigs, domestic pigs, not guinea pigs!"    Flannery was stubborn.
    "Pigs is pigs," he declared firmly.
 "Guinea-pigs, or dago pigs or Irish  pigs is all the same to the Interurban Express Company an' to Mike  Flannery.
 Th' nationality of the pig creates no differentiality in the  rate, Misther Morehouse! 'Twould be the same was they Dutch pigs or  Rooshun pigs.
 Mike Flannery," he added, "is here to tind to the expriss  business and not to hould conversation wid dago pigs in sivinteen  languages fer to discover be they Chinese or Tipperary by birth an'  nativity.
"    Mr. Morehouse hesitated.
 He bit his lip and then flung out his arms  wildly.
    "Very well!" he shouted, "you shall hear of this! Your president shall  hear of this! It is an outrage! I have offered you fifty cents.
 You  refuse it! Keep the pigs until you are ready to take the fifty cents,  but, by George, sir, if one hair of those pigs' heads is harmed I will  have the law on you!"    He turned and stalked out, slamming the door.
 Flannery carefully lifted  the soap box from the counter and placed it in a corner.
 He was not  worried.
 He felt the peace that comes to a faithful servant who has done  his duty and done it well.
    Mr. Morehouse went home raging.
 His boy, who had been awaiting the  guinea-pigs, knew better than to ask him for them.
 He was a normal boy  and therefore always had a guilty conscience when his father was  angry.
 So the boy slipped quietly around the house.
 There is nothing so  soothing to a guilty conscience as to be out of the path of the avenger.
  Mr. Morehouse stormed into the house.
 "Where's the ink?" he shouted at  his wife as soon as his foot was across the doorsill.
    Mrs. Morehouse jumped, guiltily.
 She never used ink.
 She had not seen  the ink, nor moved the ink, nor thought of the ink, but her husband's  tone convicted her of the guilt of having borne and reared a boy, and  she knew that whenever her husband wanted anything in a loud voice the  boy had been at it.
    "I'll find Sammy," she said meekly.
    When the ink was found Mr. Morehouse wrote rapidly, and he read the  completed letter and smiled a triumphant smile.
    "That will settle that crazy Irishman!" he exclaimed.
 "When they get  that letter he will hunt another job, all right!"    A week later Mr. Morehouse received a long official envelope with the  card of the Interurban Express Company in the upper left corner.
 He tore  it open eagerly and drew out a sheet of paper.
 At the top it bore the  number A6754.
 The letter was short.
 "Subject--Rate on guinea-pigs,"  it said, "Dr.
 Sir--We are in receipt of your letter regarding rate on  guinea-pigs between Franklin and Westcote addressed to the president  of this company.
 All claims for overcharge should be addressed to the  Claims Department.
"    Mr. Morehouse wrote to the Claims Department.
 He wrote six pages of  choice sarcasm, vituperation and argument, and sent them to the Claims  Department.
    A few weeks later he received a reply from the Claims Department.
  Attached to it was his last letter.
    "Dr.
 Sir," said the reply.
 "Your letter of the 16th inst.
, addressed to  this Department, subject rate on guinea-pigs from Franklin to Westcote,  ree'd.
 We have taken up the matter with our agent at Westcote, and his  reply is attached herewith.
 He informs us that you refused to receive  the consignment or to pay the charges.
 You have therefore no claim  against this company, and your letter regarding the proper rate on the  consignment should be addressed to our Tariff Department.
"    Mr. Morehouse wrote to the Tariff Department.
 He stated his case  clearly, and gave his arguments in full, quoting a page or two from the  encyclopedia to prove that guinea-pigs were not common pigs.
    With the care that characterizes corporations when they are  systematically conducted, Mr. Morehouse's letter was numbered, O.
K'd,  and started through the regular channels.
 Duplicate copies of the bill  of lading, manifest, Flannery's receipt for the package and several  other pertinent papers were pinned to the letter, and they were passed  to the head of the Tariff Department.
    The head of the Tariff Department put his feet on his desk and yawned.
  He looked through the papers carelessly.
    "Miss Kane," he said to his stenographer, "take this letter.
 'Agent,  Westcote, N.
 J.
 Please advise why consignment referred to in attached  papers was refused domestic pet rates.
"'    Miss Kane made a series of curves and angles on her note book and waited  with pencil poised.
 The head of the department looked at the papers  again.
    "Huh! guinea-pigs!" he said.
 "Probably starved to death by this time!  Add this to that letter: 'Give condition of consignment at present.
'"    He tossed the papers on to the stenographer's desk, took his feet from  his own desk and went out to lunch.
    When Mike Flannery received the letter he scratched his head.
    "Give prisint condition," he repeated thoughtfully.
 "Now what do thim  clerks be wantin' to know, I wonder! 'Prisint condition, 'is ut? Thim  pigs, praise St.
 Patrick, do be in good health, so far as I know, but I  niver was no veternairy surgeon to dago pigs.
 Mebby thim clerks wants  me to call in the pig docther an' have their pulses took.
 Wan thing I  do know, howiver, which is they've glorious appytites for pigs of their  soize.
 Ate? They'd ate the brass padlocks off of a barn door I If the  paddy pig, by the same token, ate as hearty as these dago pigs do,  there'd be a famine in Ireland.
"    To assure himself that his report would be up to date, Flannery went  to the rear of the office and looked into the cage.
 The pigs had been  transferred to a larger box--a dry goods box.
    "Wan, -- two, -- t'ree, -- four, -- five, -- six, -- sivin, -- eight!"  he counted.
 "Sivin spotted an' wan all black.
 All well an' hearty an'  all eatin' loike ragin' hippypottymusses.
 He went back to his desk and  wrote.
    "Mr. Morgan, Head of Tariff Department," he wrote.
 "Why do I say dago  pigs is pigs because they is pigs and will be til you say they ain't  which is what the rule book says stop your jollying me you know it as  well as I do.
 As to health they are all well and hoping you are the  same.
 P.
 S.
 There are eight now the family increased all good eaters.
 P.
  S.
 I paid out so far two dollars for cabbage which they like shall I put  in bill for same what?"    Morgan, head of the Tariff Department, when he received this letter,  laughed.
 He read it again and became serious.
    "By George!" he said, "Flannery is right, 'pigs is pigs.
' I'll have to  get authority on this thing.
 Meanwhile, Miss Kane, take this letter:  Agent, Westcote, N.
 J.
 Regarding shipment guinea-pigs, File No.
 A6754.
  Rule 83, General Instruction to Agents, clearly states that agents  shall collect from consignee all costs of provender, etc.
, etc.
,  required for live stock while in transit or storage.
 You will proceed to  collect same from consignee.
"    Flannery received this letter next morning, and when he read it he  grinned.
    "Proceed to collect," he said softly.
 "How thim clerks do loike to be  talkin'! Me proceed to collect two dollars and twinty-foive cints off  Misther Morehouse! I wonder do thim clerks know Misther Morehouse?  I'll git it! Oh, yes! 'Misther Morehouse, two an' a quarter, plaze.
'  'Cert'nly, me dear frind Flannery.
 Delighted!' Not!"    Flannery drove the express wagon to Mr. Morehouse's door.
 Mr. Morehouse  answered the bell.
    "Ah, ha!" he cried as soon as he saw it was Flannery.
 "So you've come to  your senses at last, have you? I thought you would! Bring the box in.
"    "I hev no box," said Flannery coldly.
 "I hev a bill agin Misther John  C.
 Morehouse for two dollars and twinty-foive cints for kebbages aten by  his dago pigs.
 Wud you wish to pay ut?"    "Pay--Cabbages--!" gasped Mr. Morehouse.
 "Do you mean to say that two  little guinea-pigs--"    "Eight!" said Flannery.
 "Papa an' mamma an' the six childer.
 Eight!"    For answer Mr. Morehouse slammed the door in Flannery's face.
 Flannery  looked at the door reproachfully.
    "I take ut the con-sign-y don't want to pay for thim kebbages," he said.
  "If I know signs of refusal, the con-sign-y refuses to pay for wan dang  kebbage leaf an' be hanged to me!"    Mr. Morgan, the head of the Tariff Department, consulted the president  of the Interurban Express Company regarding guinea-pigs, as to whether  they were pigs or not pigs.
 The president was inclined to treat the  matter lightly.
    "What is the rate on pigs and on pets?" he asked.
    "Pigs thirty cents, pets twenty-five," said Morgan.
    "Then of course guinea-pigs are pigs," said the president.
    "Yes," agreed Morgan, "I look at it that way, too.
 A thing that can come  under two rates is naturally due to be classed as the higher.
 But are  guinea-pigs, pigs? Aren't they rabbits?"    "Come to think of it," said the president, "I believe they are more like  rabbits.
 Sort of half-way station between pig and rabbit.
 I think the  question is this--are guinea-pigs of the domestic pig family? I'll ask  professor Gordon.
 He is authority on such things.
 Leave the papers with  me.
"    The president put the papers on his desk and wrote a letter to Professor  Gordon.
 Unfortunately the Professor was in South America collecting  zoological specimens, and the letter was forwarded to him by his wife.
  As the Professor was in the highest Andes, where no white man had ever  penetrated, the letter was many months in reaching him.
 The president  forgot the guinea-pigs, Morgan forgot them, Mr. Morehouse forgot them,  but Flannery did not.
 One-half of his time he gave to the duties of  his agency; the other half was devoted to the guinea-pigs.
 Long before  Professor Gordon received the president's letter Morgan received one  from Flannery.
    "About them dago pigs," it said, "what shall I do they are great in  family life, no race suicide for them, there are thirty-two now shall  I sell them do you take this express office for a menagerie, answer  quick.
"    Morgan reached for a telegraph blank and wrote:    "Agent, Westcote.
 Don't sell pigs.
"    He then wrote Flannery a letter calling his attention to the fact that  the pigs were not the property of the company but were merely being held  during a settlement of a dispute regarding rates.
 He advised Flannery to  take the best possible care of them.
    Flannery, letter in hand, looked at the pigs and sighed.
 The dry-goods  box cage had become too small.
 He boarded up twenty feet of the rear  of the express office to make a large and airy home for them, and went  about his business.
 He worked with feverish intensity when out on his  rounds, for the pigs required attention and took most of his time.
 Some  months later, in desperation, he seized a sheet of paper and wrote  "160" across it and mailed it to Morgan.
 Morgan returned it asking for  explanation.
 Flannery replied:    "There be now one hundred sixty of them dago pigs, for heavens sake let  me sell off some, do you want me to go crazy, what.
"    "Sell no pigs," Morgan wired.
    Not long after this the president of the express company received a  letter from Professor Gordon.
 It was a long and scholarly letter, but  the point was that the guinea-pig was the Cava aparoea while the common  pig was the genius Sus of the family Suidae.
 He remarked that they were  prolific and multiplied rapidly.
    "They are not pigs," said the president, decidedly, to Morgan.
 "The  twenty-five cent rate applies.
"    Morgan made the proper notation on the papers that had accumulated in  File A6754, and turned them over to the Audit Department.
 The Audit  Department took some time to look the matter up, and after the usual  delay wrote Flannery that as he had on hand one hundred and sixty  guinea-pigs, the property of consignee, he should deliver them and  collect charges at the rate of twenty-five cents each.
    Flannery spent a day herding his charges through a narrow opening in  their cage so that he might count them.
    "Audit Dept.
" he wrote, when he had finished the count, "you are way off  there may be was one hundred and sixty dago pigs once, but wake up don't  be a back number.
 I've got even eight hundred, now shall I collect  for eight hundred or what, how about sixty-four dollars I paid out for  cabbages.
"    It required a great many letters back and forth before the Audit  Department was able to understand why the error had been made of billing  one hundred and sixty instead of eight hundred, and still more time for  it to get the meaning of the "cabbages.
"    Flannery was crowded into a few feet at the extreme front of the  office.
 The pigs had all the rest of the room and two boys were employed  constantly attending to them.
 The day after Flannery had counted the  guinea-pigs there were eight more added to his drove, and by the time  the Audit Department gave him authority to collect for eight hundred  Flannery had given up all attempts to attend to the receipt or the  delivery of goods.
 He was hastily building galleries around the express  office, tier above tier.
 He had four thousand and sixty-four guinea-pigs  to care for! More were arriving daily.
    Immediately following its authorization the Audit Department sent  another letter, but Flannery was too busy to open it.
 They wrote another  and then they telegraphed:    "Error in guinea-pig bill.
 Collect for two guinea-pigs, fifty cents.
  Deliver all to consignee.
"    Flannery read the telegram and cheered up.
 He wrote out a bill as  rapidly as his pencil could travel over paper and ran all the way to the  Morehouse home.
 At the gate he stopped suddenly.
 The house stared at  him with vacant eyes.
 The windows were bare of curtains and he could see  into the empty rooms.
 A sign on the porch said, "To Let.
" Mr. Morehouse  had moved! Flannery ran all the way back to the express office.
  Sixty-nine guinea-pigs had been born during his absence.
 He ran out  again and made feverish inquiries in the village.
 Mr. Morehouse had not  only moved, but he had left Westcote.
 Flannery returned to the express  office and found that two hundred and six guinea-pigs had entered the  world since he left it.
 He wrote a telegram to the Audit Department.
    "Can't collect fifty cents for two dago pigs consignee has left town  address unknown what shall I do? Flannery.
"    The telegram was handed to one of the clerks in the Audit Department,  and as he read it he laughed.
    "Flannery must be crazy.
 He ought to know that the thing to do is to  return the consignment here," said the clerk.
 He telegraphed Flannery to  send the pigs to the main office of the company at Franklin.
    When Flannery received the telegram he set to work.
 The six boys he  had engaged to help him also set to work.
 They worked with the haste of  desperate men, making cages out of soap boxes, cracker boxes, and all  kinds of boxes, and as fast as the cages were completed they filled them  with guinea-pigs and expressed them to Franklin.
 Day after day the cages  of guineapigs flowed in a steady stream from Westcote to Franklin,  and still Flannery and his six helpers ripped and nailed and  packed--relentlessly and feverishly.
 At the end of the week they had  shipped two hundred and eighty cases of guinea-pigs, and there were in  the express office seven hundred and four more pigs than when they began  packing them.
    "Stop sending pigs.
 Warehouse full," came a telegram to Flannery.
 He  stopped packing only long enough to wire back, "Can't stop," and kept  on sending them.
 On the next train up from Franklin came one of  the company's inspectors.
 He had instructions to stop the stream of  guinea-pigs at all hazards.
 As his train drew up at Westcote station  he saw a cattle car standing on the express company's siding.
 When he  reached the express office he saw the express wagon backed up to the  door.
 Six boys were carrying bushel baskets full of guinea-pigs from the  office and dumping them into the wagon.
 Inside the room Flannery, with'  his coat and vest off, was shoveling guinea-pigs into bushel baskets  with a coal scoop.
 He was winding up the guinea-pig episode.
    He looked up at the inspector with a snort of anger.
    "Wan wagonload more an, I'll be quit of thim, an' niver will ye catch  Flannery wid no more foreign pigs on his hands.
 No, sur! They near was  the death o' me.
 Nixt toime I'll know that pigs of whaiver nationality  is domistic pets--an' go at the lowest rate.
"    He began shoveling again rapidly, speaking quickly between breaths.
    "Rules may be rules, but you can't fool Mike Flannery twice wid the same  thrick--whin ut comes to live stock, dang the rules.
 So long as Flannery  runs this expriss office--pigs is pets--an' cows is pets--an' horses  is pets--an' lions an' tigers an' Rocky Mountain goats is pets--an' the  rate on thim is twinty-foive cints.
"    He paused long enough to let one of the boys put an empty basket in the  place of the one he had just filled.
 There were only a few guinea-pigs  left.
 As he noted their limited number his natural habit of looking on  the bright side returned.
    "Well, annyhow," he said cheerfully, "'tis not so bad as ut might be.

 Sands          PREFACE    Under this head, I desire to say a few words upon three subjects,  --my friends, my book, and myself.
    My friends, though not legion in number, have been, in their  efforts in my behalf, disinterested, sincere, and energetic.
    My book: I lay it, as my first offering, at the shrine of my  country's fame.
 "Would it were worthier.
" While our soldiers  are first in every field where they meet our enemies, and while  the wisdom of our legislators is justified before all the world,  in the perfection of our beloved institutions, our literature  languishes.
 This should not be so; for literature, with its  kindred arts, makes the true glory of a nation.
 We bow in spirit  when Greece is named, not alone because she was the mother of  heroes and lawgivers, but because her hand rocked the cradle of  a literature as enduring as it is beautiful and brilliant, and  cherished in their infancy those arts which eventually repaid her  nursing care in a rich harvest of immortal renown.
    For myself I have little to say.
 I have not written for fame, and  if my life had been a happy one I should never have written at all.
  As it was, I early came to drink of the bitter cup; and sorrow,  whilst it cuts us off from the outer, drives us back upon the inner  world;--and then the unquiet demon of ceaseless thought is roused,  and the brain becomes "a whirling gulf of phantasy and flame," and  we rave and--write! Yes, write! And men read and talk about genius,  and, God help them! Often envy its unhappy possessors the fatal gift  which lies upon heart and brain like molten lead! Of all who have  gained eminence among men as poets, how few are there of whom it may  not be justly said, "They have come up through much tribulation.

          MAZELLI          Canto I.
         I.
         "Stay, traveller, stay thy weary steed,         The sultry hour of noon is near,       Of rest thy way-worn limbs have need,         Stay, then, and, taste its sweetness here.
       The mountain path which thou hast sped       Is steep, and difficult to tread,       And many a farther step 'twill cost,       Ere thou wilt find another host;       But if thou scorn'st not humble fare,       Such as the pilgrim loves to share,--       Not luxury's enfeebling spoil,       But bread secured by patient toil--       Then lend thine ear to my request,       And be the old man's welcome guest.
       Thou seest yon aged willow tree,         In all its summer pomp arrayed,       'Tis near, wend thither, then, with me,       My cot is built beneath its shade;       And from its roots clear waters burst       To cool thy lip, and quench thy thirst:--       I love it, and if harm should, come         To it, I think that I should weep;       'Tis as a guardian of my home,       So faithfully it seems to keep       Its watch above the spot where I       Have lived so long, and mean to die.
       Come, pardon me for prating thus,       But age, you know, is garrulous;       And in life's dim decline, we hold       Thrice dear whate'er we loved of old,--       The stream upon whose banks we played,       The forest through whose shades we strayed,       The spot to which from sober truth       We stole to dream the dreams of youth,       The single star of all Night's zone,       Which we have chosen as our own,       Each has its haunting memory       Of things which never more may be.
"         II.
         Thus spake an aged man to one       Who manhood's race had just begun.
       His form of manhood's noblest length       Was strung with manhood's stoutest strength,       And burned within his eagle eye       The blaze of tameless energy--       Not tameless but untamed--for life       Soon breaks the spirit with its strife       And they who in their souls have nursed       The brightest visions, are the first       To learn how Disappointment's blight       Strips life of its illusive light;       How dreams the heart has dearest held       Are ever first to be dispelled;       How hope, and power, and love, and fame,       Are each an idly sounding name,       A phantom, a deceit, a wile,       That woos and dazzles to beguile.
       But time had not yet tutored him,       The youth of hardy heart and limb,       Who quickly drew his courser's bit;       For though too haughty to submit,       In strife for mastery with men,         Yet to a prayer, or a caress,         His soul became all gentleness,--       An infant's hand might lead him then:       So answered he,--"In sooth the way       My steed and I have passed to-day,       Is of such weary, winding length,       As sorely to have tried our strength,       And I will bless the bread and salt       Of him who kindly bids me halt.
"       Then springing lightly to the ground,       His girth and saddle he unbound,       And turning from the path aside,       The steed and guest, the host and guide,       Sought where the old man's friendly door       Stood ever open to the poor:       The poor--for seldom came the great,       Or rich, the apers of their state,       That simple, rude abode to see,       Or claim its hospitality.
         III.
         From where the hermit's cottage stood,         Beneath its huge old guardian tree,         The gazer's wand'ring eye might see,       Where, in its maze of field and wood,       And stretching many a league away,       A broad and smiling valley lay:--       Lay stilly calm, and sweetly fair,       As if Death had not entered there;       As if its flowers, so bright of bloom,         Its birds, so gay of song and wing,       Would never lose their soft perfume,         Would never, never cease to sing.
       Fat flocks were in its glens at rest,       Pure waters wandered o'er its breast,       The sky was clear, the winds were still,       Rich harvests grew on every hill,       The sun in mid-day glory smiled,       And nature slumbered as a child.
         IV.
         And now, their rustic banquet done,       And sheltered from the noontide sun       By the old willow's pleasant shade,       The guest and host the scene surveyed;       Marked how the mountain's mighty base       The valley's course was seen to trace;       Marked how its graceful azure crest       Against the sky's blue arch was pressed,       And how its long and rocky chain       Was parted suddenly in twain,       Where through a chasm, wide and deep,       Potomac's rapid waters sweep,       While rocks that press the mountain's brow,       Nod o'er his waves far, far below;(1)       Marked how those waves, in one broad blaze,       Threw back the sun's meridian rays,       And, flashing as they rolled along,       Seemed all alive with light and song;       Marked how green bower and garden showed       Where rose the husbandman's abode,       And how the village walls were seen       To glimmer with a silvery sheen,       Such as the Spaniard saw, of yore,         Hang over Tenuchtitlan's walls,       When maddened with the lust of gore,         He came to desecrate her halls;       To fire her temples, towers, and thrones,       And turn her songs of peace to groans.
       They gazed, till from the hermit's eye       A tear stole slow and silently;       A tear, which Memory's hand had taken         From a deep fountain long congealed;       A tear, which showed how strongly shaken         The heart must be, which thus revealed,       Through time's dim shadows, gathering fast,       Its recollections of the past;       Then, as a sigh escaped his breast,       Thus spake the hermit to his guest.
         V.
         "Thou seest how fair a scene is here;         It seems as if 'twere planned above,       And fashioned from some happier sphere,         To be the home of peace and love.
       Yet man, too fond of strife, to dwell         In meek contentment's calm repose,       Will turn an Eden to a hell,         And triumph in his brother's woes!       And passion's lewd and lawless host,       Delight to rave and revel most       Where generous Nature stamps and strews       Her fairest forms, and brightest hues:       And Discord here has lit her brand,         And Hatred nursed her savage brood,       And stern Revenge, with crimson hand,         Has written his foul deeds in blood.
       But those who loved and suffered then,       Have given place to other men:       Of all who live, to me alone       The story, of their fate is known;       Give heed, and I will tell it thee,       Tho' mournful must the story be.
         VI.
         I mind as if 'twere yesterday,         The hour when first I stood beside         The margin of yon rushing tide,       And watched its wild waves in their play;       These locks that now are thin and gray,       Then clustered thick and dark as thine,       And few had strength of arm like mine.
       Thou seest how many a furrow now       Time's hand hath ploughed athwart my brow:       Well, then it was without a line;--       And I had other treasures too,         Of which 'tis useless now to vaunt;       Friends, who were kind, and warm, and true;         A heart, that danger could not daunt;       A soul, with wild dreams wildly stirred;       And hope that had not been deferred.
       I cannot count how many years       Have since gone by, but toil and tears,       And the lone heart's deep agony,       I feel have sadly altered me;--       Yet mourn I not the change, for those       I loved or scorned, my friends or foes,       Have fallen and faded, one by one,         As time's swift current hurried by,       Till I, of all my kith alone,         Am left to wait, and wish to die.
         VII.
         How strong a hand hath Time! Man rears,       And names his work immortal; years       Go by.
 Behold! where dwelt his pride,       Stern Desolation's brood abide;       The owl within his bower sits,       The lone bat through his chamber flits;       Where bounded by the buoyant throng,       With measured step, and choral song,       The wily serpent winds along;       While the Destroyer stalketh by,       And smiles, as if in mockery.
         How strong a band hath Time! Love weaves       His wreath of flowers and myrtle leaves,       (Methinks his fittest crown would be       A chaplet from the cypress tree;)       With hope his breast is swelling high,       And brightly beams his laughing eye;       But soon his hopes are mixed with fears,       And soon his smiles are quenched in tears:       Then Disappointment's blighting breath       Breathes o'er him, and he droops to death;       While the Destroyer glideth by,       And smiles, as if in mockery.
       How strong a hand hath Time! Fame wins         The eager youth to her embrace;       With tameless ardour he begins,         And follows up the bootless race;       Ah! bootless--for, as on he hies,       With equal speed the phantom flies,       Till youth, and strength, and vigour gone,       He faints, and sinks, and dies unknown;       While the Destroyer passeth by,       And smiles, as if in mockery.
       Gaze, stranger, on the scene below;       'Tis scarce a century ago,         Since here abode another race,       The men of tomahawk and bow,         The savage sons of war and chase;       Yet where, ah! where, abide they now?       Go search, and see if thou canst find,       One trace which they have left behind,       A single mound, or mossy grave,       That holds the ashes of the brave;       A single lettered stone to say       That they have lived, and passed away.
       Men soon will cease to name their name,       Oblivion soon will quench their fame,       And the wild story of their fate,       Will yet be subject of debate,       'Twixt antiquarians sage and able,       Who doubt if it be truth or fable.
         VIII.
         I said I minded well the time,         When first beside yon stream I stood;         Then one interminable wood,       In its unbounded breadth sublime,         And in its loneliness profound,       Spread like a leafy sea around.
       To one of foreign land and birth,       Nursed 'mid the loveliest scenes of earth,       But now from home and friends exiled,       Such wilderness were doubly wild;--       I thought it so, and scarce could I       My tears repress, when standing by       The river's brink, I thought of mine       Own native stream, the glorious Rhine!       For, near to it, with loving eye,       My mother watched my infancy;       Along its banks my childhood strayed,       With its strong waves my boyhood played.
       And I could see, in memory, still       My father's cottage on the hill,       With green vines trailing round and o'er       Wall, roof and casement, porch and door:       Yet soon I learned yon stream to bless,       And love the wooded wilderness.
       I could not then have told thee how       The change came o'er my heart, but now       I know full well the charm that wrought,       Into my soul, the spell of thought--       Of tender, pensive thought, which made       Me love the forest's deepest shade,       And listen, with delighted ear,       To the low voice of waters near,       As gliding, gushing, gurgling by,       They utter their sweet minstrelsy.
       I scarce need give that _charm_ a name;       Thy heart, I know, hath felt the same,--       Ah! where is mind, or heart, or soul,       That has not bowed to its control?         IX.
         See, where yon towering, rocky ledge,       Hangs jutting o'er the river's edge,       There channelled dark, and dull, and deep,       The lazy, lagging waters sleep;       Thence follow, with thine eagle sight,       A double stone's cast to the right,       Mark where a white-walled cottage stands,       Devised and reared by cunning hands,       A stately pile, and fair to see!         The chisel's touch, and pencil's trace,         Have blent for it a goodly grace;       And yet, it much less pleaseth me,       Than did the simple rustic cot,       Which occupied of yore that spot.
       For, 'neath its humble shelter, grew       The fairest flower that e'er drank dew;       A lone exotic of the wood,       The fairy of the solitude,       Who dwelt amid its loneliness       To brighten, beautify, and bless.
       The summer sky's serenest blue,       Would best portray her eye's soft hue;       From her white brow were backward rolled       Long curls of mingled light and gold;       The flush upon her cheek of snow,       Had shamed the rose's harsher glow;       And haughty love had, haughtier grown,       To own her breast his fairest throne.
       The eye that once behold her, ne'er         Could lose her image;--firm and bright,       All-beautiful, and pure, and clear,       'Twas stamped upon th' enamoured sight;       Unchangeable, for ever fair,       Above decay, it lingered there!       As it has lingered on mine own,       These many years, till it has grown,       In its mysterious strength, to be       A portion of my soul and me.
         X.
         Not in the peopled solitude         Of cities, does true love belong;       For it is of A thoughtful mood,         And thought abides not with the throng.
       Nor is it won by glittering wealth,         By cunning, nor device of art,       Unheralded, by silent stealth,         It wins its way into the heart.
       And once the soul has known its dream,       Thenceforth its empire is supreme,       For heart, and brain, and soul, and will,       Are bowed by its subduing thrill.
       My love, alas! not born to bless,       Had birth in nature's loneliness;       And held, at first, as a sweet spell,         It grew in strength, till it became       A spirit, which I could not quell,--         A quenchless--a volcanic flame,       Which, without pause, or time of rest,       Must burn for ever in my breast.
       Yet how ecstatically sweet,       Was its first soft tumultuous beat!       I little thought that beat could be       The harbinger of misery;       And daily, when the morning beam       Dawned earliest on wood and stream,       When, from each brake and bush were heard,       The hum of bee, and chirp of bird,       From these, earth's matin songs, my ear       Would turn, a sweeter voice to hear--       A voice, whose tones the very air       Seemed trembling with delight to bear;       From leafy wood, and misty stream,       From bush, and brake, and morning beam,       Would turn away my wandering eye,       A dearer object to descry,       Till voice so sweet, and form so bright,       Grew part of hearing and of sight.
         XI.
         Yet my fond love I never told,         But kept it, as the miser keeps,         In his rude hut, his hoarded heaps       Of gleaming gems, and glittering gold:       Gloating in secret o'er the prize,       He fears to show to other eyes;       And so passed many months away,       Till once I heard a comrade say:--       "To-morrow brings her bridal day;       Mazelli leaves the greenwood bower,       Where she has grown its fairest flower,       To bless, with her bright, sunny smile,       A stranger from a distant isle,       Whom love has lured across the sea,         O'er hill and glen, through wood and wild,       Far from his lordly home, to be         Lord of the forest's fairest child.
"       It was as when a thunder peal         Bursts, crashing from a cloudless sky,       It caused my brain and heart to reel         And throb, with speechless agony:       Yet, when wild Passion's trance was o'er,       And Thought resumed her sway once more,       I breathed a prayer that she might be       Saved from the pangs that tortured me;       That her young heart might never prove       The sting of unrequited love.
       My task I then again began,       But ah! how much an altered man,--       A single hour, a few hot tears,       Had done the wasting work of years.
         XII.
         Nor was it I alone, to whom       Those words had been as words of doom,         By some malicious fiend rehearsed:       Another one was standing by,       With princely port, and piercing eye,       Of dusky cheek, and brow, and plume;         I thought his heaving heart would burst,       His labouring bosom's heave and swell,       So strongly, quickly, rose and fell!       A long, bright blade hung at his side,       Its keen and glittering edge he tried;       He bore a bow, and this he drew,       To see if still its spring were true;       But other sign could none be caught,       Of what he suffered, felt, or thought.
       And then with firm and haughty stride,       He turned away, and left my side;       I watched him, as with rapid tread,       Along the river's marge he sped,       Till the still twilight's gathering gloom       Hid haughty form, and waving plume.
          Canto II.
         I.
         He stood where the mountain moss outspread         Its smoothness beneath his dusky foot;       The chestnut boughs above his head,         Hung motionless and mute.
       There came not a voice from the wooded hill,         Nor a sound from the shadowy glen,       Save the plaintive song of the whip-poor-will,(2)         And the waterfall's dash, and now and then,           The night-bird's mournful cry.
       Deep silence hung round him; the misty light       Of the young moon silvered the brow of Night,         Whose quiet spirit had flung her spell       O'er the valley's depth, and the mountain's height,         And breathed on the air, till its gentle swell       Arose on the ear like some loved one's call;       And the wide blue sky spread over all           Its starry canopy.
       And he seemed as the spirit of some chief,         Whose grave could not give him rest;       So deep was the settled hue of grief,         On his manly front impressed:       Yet his lips were compressed with a proud disdain,         And his port was erect and high,       Like the lips of a martyr who mocks at pain,         As the port of a hero who scorns to fly,           When his men have failed in fight;         Who rather a thousand deaths would die,           Than his fame should suffer blight.
         II.
         And who by kith, and who by name,         Is he, that lone, yet haughty one?       By his high brow, and eye of flame,         I guess him old Ottalli's son.
       Ottalli! whose proud name was here       In other times, a sound of fear!       The fleet of foot, and strong of hand,       Chief of his tribe, lord of the land,       The forest child, of mind and soul       Too wild and free to brook control!       In chase was none so swift as he,         In battle none so brave and strong;       To friends, all love and constancy,--         But we to those who wrought him wrong!       His arm would wage avenging strife,       With bow, and spear, and bloody knife,       Till he had taught his foes to feel,       How true his aim, how keen his steel.
       Now others hold the sway he held,--         His day and power have passed away;       His goodly forests all are felled,         And songs of mirth rise, clear and gay,       Chaunted by youthful voices, where       His battle-hymn once filled the air--       Where blazed the lurid council fire,       The village church erects its spire;       And where the mystic war-dance rang,       With its confused, discordant clang,       While stern, fierce lips, with many a cry       For blood and vengeance, filled the sky,       Mild Mercy, gentle as the dove,       Proclaims her rule of peace and love.
       And of his true and faithful clan,       Of child and matron, maid and man,       Of all he loved, survives but one--       His earliest, and his only son!       That son's sole heritage his fame,       His strength, his likeness, and his name.
         III.
         And thus from varying year to year,       The youthful chief has lingered here;       Chief!--why is he so nobly named?       How many warriors at his call,       By Arcouski's breath inflamed,         Would with him fight, and for him fall?       Of all his father's warrior throng,         Remains not one whose lip could now       Rehearse with him the battle song,         Whose hand could bend the hostile bow.
       And yet, no weak, complaining word,       From his stern lip is ever heard;       And his bright eye, so black and clear,       Is never moistened by a tear;       Of quiet mien, and mournful mood,       He lives, a stoic of the wood;       Gliding about from place to place,       With noiseless step, and steady pace,       Haunting each fountain, glen, and grot,       Like the lone Genius of the spot.
         IV.
         And this was he who, standing there,       Seemed as an image of Despair,       Which agony's convulsive strife,       Had quickened into breathing life.
       The writhing lip, the brow all wet       With Pain's cold, clammy, deathlike sweat;       The hand, that with unconscious clasp,       Strained his keen dagger in its grasp;       The eye, that lightened with the blaze       Of frenzied Passion's maniac gaze;       The nervous, shuddering thrill, which came       At intervals along his frame;       The tremulously heaving breast,--       These signs the inward storm confessed:       Yet, through those signs of wo, there broke       Flashes of fearless thought, which spoke       A soul within, whose haughty will       Would wrestle with immortal ill,       And only quit the strife, when fate       Its being should annihilate.
       Silent he stood, until the breeze       Bore from his lips some words like these.
         V.
         "The words I speak are no complaint         And if I breathe out my despair,       It is not that my heart grows faint,         Or shrinks from what 'tis doomed to bear.
       Though every sorrow which may shake         Or rend man's heart, should pierce my own,       Their strength united, should not make         My lip breathe one complaining tone.
       If I must suffer, it shall be         With a firm heart, a soul elate,       A wordless scorn, which silently         Shall mock the stern decrees of fate.
       The weak might bend, the timid shrink,         Until misfortune's storm blew by,       But I, a chieftain's son, should drink         Its proffered cup without a sigh.
       And it will scarcely, to my lip,         Seem harsher than yon fountain's flow,       For I have held companionship         With Misery, from my youth till now--       Have felt, by turns, each pang, each care,       Her hapless sons are doomed, to bear;--       I caught my mother's parting breath,         When passed she to the spirit land;       And from the fatal field of death,         Where, leading on his fearless band,       With fiery and resistless might,       He fell, though victor in the fight,       Pierced by the arrow of some foe,       I saw my father's spirit go.
       And I have seen his warrior men,       From mountain, valley, hill, and glen,       Departing one by one, since then,       As from the dry and withered spray,       The wilted leaves are blown away,       Upon some windy autumn day:       I, only I, am left to be       The last leaf of the blighted tree,       Which the first wind that through the sky       Goes carelessly careering by,       Will, in its wild, unheeded mirth,       Rend from its hold, and dash to earth:       Thus, here alone have I remained,       An outcast, where I should have reigned.
         VI.
         "How shall I to myself alone,       The weakness of my bosom own?       Why, mindful of my fame and pride,       When my brave brethren had died;       Why, with my friendly, ready knife,       Drew I not forth my useless life?       Was it a coward fear of death,       That bade me treasure up my breath?       Or had life yet some genial ray,       That wooed me in its warmth to stay?       Had earth yet one whose smile could stir,       My spirit with deep love for her?       Yes, though within me hope was dead,       And wild Ambition's dreams were fled;       Though o'er my blighted heart, Despair       Desponded, love still nestled there;       Love! how the pale-faced scorner's lip         Would sneer, to hear me name that name;       Yet was it deep within my soul         A secret but consuming flame;       Whose overruling mastership,       Defied slow Reason's dull control!       And felt for one of that vile race,       To whom my tribe had given place;         Was nursed in silence and in shame!       Shame, for the weakness of a heart,         Yet bleeding from th' oppressor's blow,       Which could bestow its better part         Upon the offspring of a foe!       They, the mean delvers of the soil,       The wielders of the felling axe,--       Because we will not stoop to toil,         Nor to its burdens bond our backs;       Because we scorn Seduction's wiles,       Her lying words and forged smiles,       They, the foul slaves of lust and gold,       Say that our blood and hearts are cold.
(3)       But ere the morrow's dawning light       Has climbed yon eastern craggy height,       One, whose fierce eye and haughty brow,       Are lit with pride and pleasure now,       Shall learn, at point of my true steel,       How much the Red man's heart may feel,--       How fearlessly he strikes the foe,       When love and vengeance prompt the blow!       Though scorned by him, I know an art       Could stop the beatings of his heart,       Ere his own lips could say, 'Be still!'         A single arrow from my bow,       Bathed in the poisonous manchenille,(4)         Would in an instant lay him low;       So deadly is the icy chill,       With which the life-blood it congeals,       The wounded warrior scarcely feels       Its fatal touch ere he expire:       But, when Revenge would glut his ire,       He stops not with immediate death       The current of his victim's breath;       With gasp, and intervening pause,       The lifeblood from its source he draws,       Marks, in the crimson stream that flows,       How near life verges to its close,--       And its last soul-exhaling groan,       To him is music's sweetest tone!       And he, whose fate it is to die,       Ere Morning's banner flouts the sky,       The eye shall see, the arm shall know,       That guides and deals th' avenging blow;       And ere his spirit goes to rest,         Right well his scornful heart shall learn,       How fiercely, in a savage breast,         The flames of love and hate may burn.
"       He spake, and down the mountain's side,       With quick, impatient step, he hied,       Threading the forest's lonely gloom,       A ruthless minister of doom.
         VII.
         'Twas midnight; calmly slept the Earth,         And the mysterious eyes above,         Gazed down with chastened looks of love,       Not, as when first they hymned her birth,       With ardent songs of holy mirth,       But mournfully serene and clear;--         As on some erring one we gaze,         Whose feet have strayed from wisdom's ways,       But who, in error, still is dear.
       Far o'er yon swiftly flowing stream       Fair fell the young moon's silver beam,       And gazing on its restless sheen,       Stood one whose garb, and port, and mien,       Bespoke him of a foreign land,       One born to win, and hold command;       The master mind, the leading one,       Where deeds of manly might were done.
       Yet, by the hallowed glow, that came         O'er lip and cheek, o'er eye and brow,         He who beheld, might guess that now       His thoughts were not of wealth and fame:       Whence could that veiling radiance shine,       Save from Affection's holy shrine?       And this was he, who from afar,         Had come to bear away his bride;       And love had been the guiding star,         That lit him o'er the trackless tide;       "To-morrow, on its sunny wing,       My bridal hour soon shall bring;       And those bright orbs which o'er me shed         Such gentle radiance from on high,       Shall shine upon my nuptial bed,         When next they walk along the sky.
       O! what are all the pomps of earth,       Of honour, glory, greatness, worth,       Beside the bliss which Love confers       Upon his humblest followers!"       He said, and from the river turned;--       An eye, that with fierce hatred burned,       Met his, and this reply was made:       "Thou, haughty one, shalt be a shade       Ere dawns the coming morrow's sun.
"       Then, ere the point he could evade,         He felt the sharp steel pierce his breast,       While he, who the foul deed had done       Stood calmly by, and saw him sink       In death, beside the water's brink,       Saw, gush by gush, the crimson blood       Pour out, and mingle with the flood;         Then drew his dagger from its rest,       And gazing on its fearful hue,       Said, "Thou hast yet one task to do.
       He who, death-wounded, welters there,       Came hither, o'er the deep to bear         Far off from her paternal nest,       The white dove I have watched so long.
       The falcon's wing was bold and strong,       Yet thou hast stayed him in his flight;       Strike one more blow, and thou to-night       May'st rest;" then laid his bosom bare,       And buried deep the dagger there,       And by his victim's lifeless trunk,       Without a sigh or groan he sunk.
          Canto III.
         I.
         With plumes to which the dewdrops cling,       Wide waves the morn her golden wing;       With countless variegated beams       The empurpled orient glows and gleams;       A gorgeous mass of crimson clouds       The mountain's soaring summit shrouds;       Along the wave the blue mist creeps,         The towering forest trees are stirred       By the low wind that o'er them sweeps,         And with the matin song of bird,         The hum of early bee is heard,       Hailing with his shrill, tiny horn,       The coming of the bright-eyed morn;       And, with the day-beam's earliest dawn,         Her couch the fair Mazelli quits,       And gaily, fleetly as a fawn,         Along the wildwood paths she flits,       Hieing from leafy bower to bower,       Culling from each its bud and flower,       Of brightest hue and sweetest breath,       To weave them in her bridal wreath.
       Now, pausing in her way, to hear       The lay of some wild warbler near,       Repaying him, in mocking tone,       With music sweeter than his own;       Now, o'er some crystal stream low bending,         Her image in its waves to see,       With its sweet, gurgled music blending,         A song of tenfold melody;       Now, chasing the gay butterfly,       That o'er her pathway passed her by,       With grace as careless, glee as wild,       As though she were some thoughtless child;       Now, seated on some wayside stone,       With time's green, messy veil o'ergrown,       In silent thoughtfulness, she seems         To hold communion with her heart,       Beguiling fancy with the dreams         That from its Pure recesses start.
         II.
         There is a silent power, that o'er         Our bosoms wields a wizard might,         Restoring bygone years to light,       With the same vivid glow they wore,       Ere time had o'er their features cast       The shadowy shroud that veils the past:--       To those who walk in wisdom's way,         'Tis welcome as an angel's smile;       But those who from her counsels stray,         Whose hearts are full of craft and guile,       To them 'tis as a constant goad--       A weight that doubles Sorrow's load,--       A silent searcher of the breast,       Which will not let the guilty rest.
       In childhood's pleasant-season born,         It haunts us in all after time;       From youth's serene and sunny morn         To manhood's stern meridian prime.
       From manhood, till the weight of years,       And life's dull constant toil, and tears,       And passion's ever raging storm,       Have dimmed the eye and bowed the form.
       True, youth, of hope and love possessed,       By friends--youth has no foes--caressed,       Finds in the present--happy boy!--       Enough of gaiety and joy;       And man, whose visionary brain       Begets that idle phantom train       Of shadows--Power, Wealth, and Fame,--       A scourge--a bubble--and a name--       So often and so vainly sought--       Has little time for peaceful thought;       And so they turn not back to gaze,       Where faithful memory displays       Her record of departed days;       But oh! how loves the eye of age,       To move along its pictured page,       To scan and number, o'er and o'er,       The joys that may return no more;       The hopes that, blighted in their bloom,       By disappointment's chilly gloom,       Were given sadly to the tomb;       The loves so wildly once enjoyed,       By time's unsparing hand destroyed;       The bright imaginative dreams,       Portrayed by restless fancy's beams,       By restless fancy's beams portrayed,       Alas! but to delude and fade!       To count these o'er and o'er again       Is age's sole resort from pain.
       Then, stranger, marvel not that I         Have claimed so long thy listening ear;       I could not pass in silence by         Themes to my memory so dear,       As those which make my story's close--         Mazelli's love, Mazelli's woes.
         III.
         Ascending from the golden east,       The sun had gained his zenith height,       The guests were gathered to the feast,       Prepared to grace the marriage rite;       The youthful and the old were there,       The rustic swain and bashful fair;       The aged, reverend and gray,       Yet hale, and garrulous, and gay,       Each told, to while the time away,       Some tale of his own wedding day;       The youthful, timorous and shy,       Spoke less with lip than tell-tale eye,       That, in its stolen glances, sends       The language Love best, comprehends.
       The noontide hour goes by, and yet         The bridegroom tarries--why? and where?       Sure he could not his vows forget,         When she who loves him is so fair!       And then his honour, faith, and pride,       Had bound him to a meaner bride,         If once his promise had been given;       But she, so pure, so far above         The common forms of earthly mould,       So like the incarnate shapes of love,         Conceived, and born, and nursed in heaven,         His love for her could ne'er grow cold!       And yet he comes not.
 Half way now,         From where, at his meridian height,         He pours his fullest, warmest light,       To where, at eve, in his decline,       The day-god sinks into the brine,       When his diurnal task is done,       Descends his ever burning throne,       And still the bridegroom is not, there--       Say, why yet tarries he, and where?         IV.
         Within an arbour, rudely reared,       But to the maiden's heart endeared       By every tie that binds the heart,       By hope's, and love's, and memory's art,--       For it was here he first poured out       In words, the love she could not doubt,--       Mazelli silent sits apart.
       Did ever dreaming devotee,         Whose restless fancy, fond and warm,         Shapes out the bright ideal form       To which he meekly bends the knee,       Conceive of aught so fair as she?       The holiest seraph of the sphere       Most holy, if by chance led here,         Might drink such light from those soft eyes,       That he would hold them far more dear         Than all the treasures of the skies.
       Yet o'er her bright and beauteous brow       Shade after shade is passing now,       Like clouds across the pale moon glancing,       As thought on rapid thought advancing,       Thrills through the maiden's trembling breast,       Not doubting, and yet not at rest.
       Not doubting! Man may turn away       And scoff at shrines, where yesterday       He knelt, in earnest faith, to pray,       And wealth may lose its charm for him,       And fame's alluring star grow dim,       Devotion, avarice, glory, all       The pageantries of earth may pall;       But love is of a higher birth       Than these, the earth-born things of earth,--       A spark from the eternal flame,       Like it, eternally the same,       It is not subject to the breath       Of chance or change, of life or death.
       And so doubt has no power to blight       Its bloom, or quench its deathless light,--       A deathless light, a peerless bloom,       That beams and glows beyond the tomb!       Go tell the trusting devotee,       His worship is idolatry;       Say to the searcher after gold,       The prize he seeks is dull and cold;       Assure the toiler after fame,       That, won, 'tis but a worthless name,       A mocking shade, a phantasy,--       And they, perchance, may list to thee;       But say not to the trusting maid,       Her love is scorned, her faith betrayed,--       As soon thy words may lull the gale,       As gain her credence to the tale!       And still the bridegroom is not there--       Oh! why yet tarries he, and where?         V.
         It was the holy vesper hour,         The time for rest, and peace, and prayer,       When falls the dew, and folds the flower         Its petals, delicate and fair,         Against the chilly evening air;         And yet the bridegroom was not there.
       The guests, who lingered through the day,       Had glided, one by one, away,       And then, with pale and pensive ray,         The moon began to climb the sky,       As from the forest, dim and green,       A small and silent band was seen         Emerging slow and solemnly;       With cautious step, and measured tread,       They moved as those who bear the dead;       And by no lip a word was spoke,       Nor other sound the silence broke,       Save when, low, musical, and clear,       The voice of waters passing near,       Was softly wafted to the ear,       And the cool, fanning twilight breeze,       That lightly shook the forest trees,       And crept from leaf to trembling leaf,       Sighed, like to one oppressed with grief.
       Why move they with such cautious care?       What precious burden do they bear?       Hush, questioner! the dead are there;--       The victim of revenge and hate,         Of fierce Ottali's fiery pride,       With that stern minister of fate,         As cold and lifeless by his side.
         VI.
         Still onward, solemnly and slow,       And speaking not a word, they go,       Till pausing in their way before       Mazelli's quiet cottage door,       They gently lay their burden down.
         Whence comes that shriek of wild despair         That rises wildly on the air?       Whose is the arm so fondly thrown       Around the cold, unconscious clay,       That cannot its caress repay?       Such wordless wo was in that cry,       Such pain, such hopeless agony,       No soul, excluded from the sky,         Whom unrelenting justice hath         Condemned to bear the second death,       E'er breathed upon the troubled gale       A wilder or a sadder wail;--       It rose, all other sounds above,       The dirge of peace, and hope, and love!         VII.
         And day on weary day went by,       And like the drooping autumn leaf,       She faded slow and silently,         In her deep, uncomplaining grief;       For, sick of life's vacuity,         She neither sought nor wished relief.
       And daily from her cheek, the glow       Departed, and her virgin brow       Was curtained with a mournful gloom,--       A shade prophetic, of the tomb;       And her clear eyes, so blue and bright,       Shot forth a keen, unearthly light,       As if the soul that in them lay,       Were weary of its garb of clay,       And prayed to pass from earth away;       Nor was that prayer vain, for ere       The frozen monarch of the year,       Had blighted, with his icy breath,       A single bud in summer's wreath,       They shrouded her, and made her grave,         And laid her down at Lodolph's side;       And by the wide Potomac's wave,       Repose the bridegroom and the bride.
         'Tis said, that, oft at summer midnight, there,       When all is hushed and voiceless, and the air,       Sweet, soothing minstrel of the viewless hand,       Swells rippling through the aged trees, that stand       With their broad boughs above the wave depending,       With the low gurgle of the waters blending       The rustle of their foliage, a light boat,       Bearing two shadowy forms, is seen to float       Adown the stream, without or oar or sail,       To break the wave, or catch the driving gale;       Smoothly and steadily its course is steered,       Until the shadow of yon cliff is neared,       And then, as if some barrier, hid below       The river's breast, had caught its gliding prow,       Awhile, uncertain, o'er its watery bed,       It hangs, then vanishes, and in its stead,       A wan, pale light burns dimly o'er the wave       That rolls and ripples by Mazelli's grave.
          Notes To Mazelli      Note 1.
         "And how its long and rocky chain       Was parted suddenly in twain,       Where through a chasm, wide and deep,       Potomac's rapid waters sweep,       While rocks that press the mountain's brow       Nod O'er his waves far, far below.
"    "The passage of the Potomac, through the Blue Ridge, is perhaps, one of  the most stupendous scenes in nature.
 You stand on a very high point of  land.
 On your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged along the  foot of the mountain a hundred miles to seek a vent.
 On your left  approaches the Potomac, seeking a vent also.
 In the moment of their  junction, they rush together against the mountain, rend it asunder, and  pass off to the sea.
    "The first glance at this scene hurries our senses into the opinion that  this earth has been created in time; that the mountains were formed  first; that the rivers began to flow afterwards; that, in this place  particularly, they have been dammed up by the Blue Ridge Mountains, and  have formed an ocean which filled the whole valley; that, continuing to  rise, they have at length broken over at this spot, and have torn the  mountain down from its summit to its base.
    "The piles of reckon each hand, but particularly on the Shenandoah, the  evident marks of their disrupture and avulsion from their beds by the  most powerful agents of nature, corroborate the impression.
 But the  distant finishing which nature has given to this picture, is of a very  different character.
 It is a true contrast to the foreground.
 It is as  Placid and delightful as that is wild and tremendous.
    "For, the mountain being cloven asunder, she presents to the eye,  through the cleft, a small catch of smooth blue horizon, at   an  infinite distance in the plain country, inviting you, as it were, from  the riot and tumult roaring around, to pass through the breach, and  participate of the calm below.
"--Jefferson's Notes on Virginia.
      Note 2.
         "Save the plaintive song of the whip-poor-will.
"    That the Indian mind and language are not devoid of poetry, the names  they have given to this bird (the whip-poor-will) sufficiently evidence.
  Some call it the "Muckawis," others the "Wish-ton-wish," signifying "the  voice of a sigh," and "the plaint for the lost.
" Those, who in its  native glens at twilight, have listened to its indescribably melancholy  song, will know how beautifully appropriate these names are.
      Note 3.
         "They, the foul slaves' of lust and gold,       Say that our blood and hearts are cold.
"    It has been advanced by some writers, that the almost miraculous  fortitude often displayed by Indians, under the most intense suffering,  is to be accounted for by their insensibility to pain, resulting, they  allege, from a defective nervous organization.
 From the absence of a  display of gallantry and tenderness between the sexes, they argue also,  in them, the nonexistence of love, and its kindred passions.
 This we  think unjust, as it robs them of the honours of a system of education,  which is life-long, and whose sole object is to attain the mastery of  all feeling, physical or mental.
 The view taken of this subject by  Robertson, in his History of America, to us, seems most accordant with  truth.
 He says: "The amazing steadiness with which the Americans endure  the most exquisite torments, has induced some authors to suppose that,  from the peculiar feebleness of their frame, their sensibility is not so  acute as that of other people; as women, and persons of a relaxed habit,  are observed to be robust men, whose nerves are more firmly braced.
 But  the constitution of the Americans is not so different in its texture,  from that of the rest of the human species, as to account for this  diversity in their behaviour.
 It flows from a principle of honour,  instilled early and cultivated with such care, as to inspire him in his  rudest state with a heroic magnanimity, to which philosophy hath  endeavoured in vain to form him, when more highly improved and polished.
  This invincible constancy he has been taught to consider as the chief  distinction of a man, and the highest attainment of a warrior.
 The ideas  which influence his conduct, and the passions which take possession of  his heart, are few.
 They operate of course with more decisive effect,  than when the mind is crowded with a multiplicity of objects, or  distracted by the variety of its pursuits; and when every motive that  acts with any force in forming the sentiments of a savage, prompts him  to suffer with dignity, he will bear what might seem impossible for  human patience to sustain.
 But whenever the fortitude of the Americans  is not roused to exertion by their ideas of honour, their feelings of  pain are the same with those of the rest of mankind.
"      Note 4.

"    The slightest wound from an arrow dipped in the juice of the  Manchenille, causes certain and speedy death.

         A fountain near the summit of a mountain, from which, through a       deep glen, a stream descends to the valley below.
 A city seen in       the distance.
 Time, midnight.
 Werner standing near the fountain.
         Werner (solus).
         Eternal rocks and hills!       Mighty and vast; and you, ye giant oaks,       Whose massy branches have for centuries       Played with the breeze and battled with the storm,       He, who so oft has trod your rugged paths,       And laid him down beneath your shades to rest,       Returns to be your dweller once again.
       I sooner far would make your wilds my home,       With nought but your rude eaves to shield me from       The winter's cold or summer's heat, than be       One of the hundred thousand human flies       That swarm within yon filthy city's walls.
       Here, I at least may live in solitude,       Free from a forced communion with a race,       Whose presence makes me feel that I am bound,       By nature, to the thing I loathe the most,       Earth's stateliest, proudest, meanest reptile, man!       The beauty of a god adorns his form,       The foulness of a fiend is in his heart;       The viper's, or the scorpion's filthy nest       Nurses a far less deadly, poisonous brood       Than are the hellish lusts, the avarice,--       The pride--the hate--the double-faced deceits--       That make his breast their dwelling.
       If he be not beneath hell's wish to damn,       Too lost for even fiends to meddle with,       How must they laugh to hear him, in his pride,       Baptize his vices, virtues; making use       Of holy names to designate his crimes;       Giving his lust the sacred name of love;       Calling his avarice a goodly sin,       Care for his household; naming his deceit       Praiseworthy caution; boasting of his hate,       When he no more can cloak it, as a proof       Of strength of mind and honesty of heart.
       For all of goodness that remains on earth,       The name of virtue might be banished from it.
       Fathers, who waste in shameful riotings       The bread for which their children cry at home;       Mothers, who put aside th' unconscious babe       That they may wrong its father; children, who       Grow old in crime ere they have spent their youth;       These are its habitants.
       I cannot brook the thought, that I belong       To their vile race.
 My sufferings have been great,       And keen enough to prove my immortality;       For dust could not have borne what I have suffered.
       My mind has pierced far, far beyond the length       Of mortal vision, and discovered things       Of which men scarcely dream, and paid in pain,       The price of what it learned and bought with pangs       By which a thousand ages were compressed       Into one hour of agony: a power       Which is a terror to possess, and yet       This one thought only irks me.
       Methinks the peaceful earth will scarcely give       My dust a resting-place within its bosom,       But cast it forth as if too vile, to mingle       With clay that ne'er has been the slave of sin.
       What! other watchers here at this lone hour?         [An evil spirit enters, singing.
            The world is half hidden,            By midnight's dark shadow;            The filly, witch-ridden,            Skims over the meadow;            The house-dog is barking,            The night-owl is hooting,            The glow-worm is sparkling,            The meteor is shooting;            And forms, which lie            So stiff and still,            In their shrouds so chill,            Through the live-long day,            Now burst their clay,            And flit through the sky,            On their dusky pinions:            Hell's dominions              Keep holiday.
       Sisters, sisters, wherever your watches         Are kept, fleet hither to me,       Fleet hither, fleet hither, and leave earth's wretches         Alone to their misery.

              We come!            Vice needs no assistance,            She meets no resistance,            Virtue's existence              Is only in name;            Drinking and eating,            Intriguing and cheating,            Carousing, completing            Their ruin and shame;            Old age unrepenting,            Manhood unrelenting,            Youth sighing and winning,            Deceiving and sinning,            Deserting, repining,              All men are the same.
                Ho! ho!       Earth quakes with the weight of the anguish she bears,       Her plains and her valleys are deluged with tears,       And her sighs, if united, were deeper by far,       Than the thunderbolt's peal, when the clouds are at war.
       There is, not a bosom, that bears not within       Its chambers, the blot and the burden of sin;       Not a mind, but in many an hour bath felt       The curse of its nature, the pangs of its guilt.
         These earth-worms! whose sire would have had us to bow       To his dust-moulded Godship! what--what are they now?       In the scale of true goodness, they sink far below       The poor, patient ox, that they yoke to the plough.
       Let them revel awhile, in the false glaring light       Of deception, that blindness but seems to make bright;       Let them gather awhile of time's perishing flowers;       The revenge of eternity! This shall be ours!       Ho! ho!         [They settle near the fountain.
 The first Spirit addresses them.
         The night is advancing,       Come, let us, dancing       In dewy circles deftly tread;       And while we dance round,       New schemes shall be found,       To ruin the living, and trouble the dead.
         [They form a circle on the margin of the stream, and dance round       singing.
         I.
         Life is but a fleeting day,       Half of which man dreams away;       Night! we follow in thy train--       Sleep! supreme o'er thee we reign;       Ours the dreams that come when thou       Sit'st upon the unconscious brow;       Reason then deserts her throne,       We then reign, and we alone.
         II.
         Then seek we, for the maiden's pillow,       Far beyond the Atlantic's billow,       Love's apple, and when we have found it,       Draw the magic circle round it;(1)       Fearless pluck it, then no charm       That it bears may do us harm;       Place it near the sleeper's head,         It will bring love's visions nigh,       And when the pleasing, dreams are fled,         The waking, pensive maid will sigh,       Till her bosom has possessed,       The form that made her dreams so blest.
       And when a maiden finds a lover,       Her happy days are nearly over:       Nature hath unchaste desires,       Love awakes her slumbering fires,       And the bosom that is true in       Love is ever near its ruin;       Passion's pleading melts the frost       Of chilliest hearts, and all is lost:       For, once vice blots a maiden's name,       She soon forgets her maiden shame.
         III.
         Haunt the debauchee with dreams,       Of the victim of his schemes;       Paint her with dishevelled hair,       Streaming eyes, and bosom bare,       And with aspect pale and sad,       As a spectre's from the dead,       Weeping o'er her new-born, child,       Her name reproached, her fame despoiled:       Let her groanings reach his ear,       Pierce his heart, and rouse his fear       Of the retribution given,       To such deeds as his, by Heaven.
         IV.
         Around the drunkard's tattered couch,       Let pale-faced want and misery crouch,       His children shivering o'er the hearth,       Cheered by no sound of social mirth,       Upbraiding, with their timid glances,       The author of their sad mischances;       And she to whom the holy vow       Of the altar bound him, now       With sunken eye, and beauty faded,       Tresses silvered, brow o'ershaded,       Clinging to him fondly still,       With a love that mocks each ill,       Which would vainly strive to tear       Her soul from one who once was dear.
         Now haste we, each our task to do,         Ere the starry hours wane through!         [They fly off, singing as they disappear.
         Ere the Morning's rosy wing,         Has brushed the damp night-shades away,       Ere the birds their matins sing,       Choiring to the new-born day,       Though its bright birth-hour be near,       Many a sigh, and many a tear,       Shall attest the mystic might,       Of those who walk the world by night.
         Werner (solus).
         The ruin of the living!   if that be       Your only task, you have a poor employ.
       Give man his three score years, and he will make       A wreck, the skill of hell might show forth as       A sample of its handiwork, and then,       Exult at the completeness of its ruin.
       The troubling of the dead!--if memory lives       In that far world, to which the spirit hastens,       When she casts off the clay that clogs her wings,       E'en there ye are forestalled, for man will need       No curse, to make his second life a hell,       If be retains the memory of his first.
       Had the clear waters of this gurgling brook,       The pow'r to wash time's blots from th' mind's page,       And all earth's mountains were compact of gold,       Her rivers nectar, and her oceans wine,       Her hills all fruitful, and her valleys fresh,       And full of loveliness as Eden was,       Ere sin's sad blight fell on its living bow'rs,       And all were mine, I'd give them but to lay       My weary limbs along this streamlet's bed,       And sleep in full forgetfulness awhile.
       But, I forget my task--now let me to it!         [He takes a vial from his bosom, and flings its contents into the       air, chanting,         Spirit       Wherever be thy home,       In earth or air,       My message hear,       And fear it.
       By the power which I have earned,         To which thy knee has knelt,       By the spell which I have learned,         A spell which thou, hast felt,           I bid thee hither come!         [A white cloud appears in the distance, floating up the glen, and       a voice is heard, singing as it approaches,         I.
         I saw from port a vessel steer,       The skies were clear, the winds were fair,       More swiftly than the hunted deer,       Upon her snowy wings of air,       She flew along the silv'ry water,       As fearlessly as if some sprite,       Familiar with the deep, had taught her,       A spell by which to rule the might       Of winds and waves, when met to try       Their strength, up midway in the sky.
         II.
         Along her trackless watery way,       With unabated speed she flew,       Still gay and careless, till the day       Waned past: night came: the heavens grew       Black, dread and threat'ning.
 Then the storm       Came forth in its devouring wrath;       Before it fled Fear's pallid form;       Destruction followed in its path;       It passed: the morning came: in vain,       I look for that lost bark again.
         III.
         Far down beneath the deep blue waves,       Within some merman's coral hall,       Her fated crew have found their graves;       Above them, for their burial pall,       The mermaids spread their flowing tresses;       The waters chant their requiem;       From many an eyelid, Pity presses       Her tender, dewy tears for them:       The natives of the ocean weep,       To view them sleeping death's pale sleep.
         IV.
         Thou, mortal, wast the bark I saw;       The waters, were the sea of life;       And thou, alas! too well dost know,       What storms were imaged in the strife       Of winds and waves.
 The hopes of youth,       Thou, in that bark's lost crew, may'st see,--       All buried now within that smooth,       Vast, boundless deep,--eternity:--       And I, a spirit though I be,       Can pity still, and weep for thee.
         [The cloud settles near the fountain, and, unclosing, discovers       a beautiful form looking steadily at Werner.
         WERNER (addressing it).
         How beautiful!       If intercourse between all living worlds,       Had not been barr'd by Him who gave them life,       I should believe thou wert the guardian spirit,       Of that which men have named the Queen of Night.
       Like her, thou art majestic, pale and sad,       And of a tender beauty: those bright curls       That press thy brow, and cling about thy neck,       Seem made of sunbeams, caught upon their way       To earth, by some creative hand, and woven       Into a fairy web, of light and life,       Conscious of its high source, and proud to be       A part of aught so beautiful as thou.
       I have seen many full, bright mortal eyes,       That were a labyrinth of witching charms,       In which the heart of him who looked was lost;       But none like thine; their light is not of earth;       Their loveliness not like what man calls lovely.
       Beside the smoothness of thy brow and cheek,       The lily's lip were rough; each of thy limbs,       Is, in itself, a being and a beauty.
       If that the orb thou didst inhabit, ere       Thou wert a portion of eternity,       Was worthy of such dwellers, oh! how fair       And glorious, must have been its fields and bow'rs!       How clear its streams! how pure and fresh its airs!       How mellow were its fruits! how bright its flow'rs!       How strong and brave the beings, fit to share       It with thee! 'Tis most strange that He, whose hand       Fashions such wondrous things, should take delight       In striking them to nothingness again!       Perchance the author of all evil had       Invaded it, and made it quite unfit       To be a part of God's great universe.
       And yet thou lookest as if thou wert beyond       The power of temptation to assail.
       Hast thou too sinned?         Spirit.
         I have lived as thou livest, died as thou       Wilt have to die, and am what thou shalt be.
         Werner           I have not questioned thee of life or death,       Nor of the state which shall succeed them both;       I care not for the first, nor fear the second;       The last I leave to Him who gave to man       Eternity for his inheritance.
         But I would know if the unceasing war,       Which good and evil wage upon the earth,       Has reached beyond, its confines.
         Spirit.
           Have I not answered thee?       The Begetter of worlds, stars, suns, and systems!       The Father of Creation! the Bridegroom       Of the Spirit! hath He not written that       Death has dominion only over sin?       And thou would'st know if other worlds have felt       The curse that fell upon, and blighted thine.
       Poor simple child of clay! no doubt thou know'st       The story of the Eden of thy sire,       And think'st that there, in its fresh, stainless breast,       The baleful seeds of evil first were sown,       Which since have spread so fearfully abroad,--       When the sad doom, that came on him and his,       Was but the spray, cast from the wave of fate,       Which just then reached thy newly finished orb.
       Where it first started--whither tends its course--       Where it shall stop--how many wrecks of worlds--       Once fairer far than thine was at its birth--       Shall strew its desolate way,--is not for things       Brought forth from dust to know.
       What wouldst thou of me?         Werner.
           The sole remaining good, if good it be,       That yet is mine to share.
 I have tried all       That earthly hope holds out to satisfy       The longings of man's nature.
 I have loved,       And made an idol of the thing I loved,       And worshipped it with all my soul's intensity;       And, for awhile, the frenzy of my dream       Shut out all other thoughts.
 But it was short;       Death plucked my lovely flower from my grasp,       And then, the icy chill of desolation       Came, like a snowy avalanche, upon       My heart, and froze the fountains of its feeling.
         I was ambitious.
 I have striven for,       And worn, the gaudiest wreath of fame, and when       I would have placed it on my brow, it grew       A mountain in its weight.
 I courted much       The notice of the world, and when men praised,       The very breath that bore their praise to me,       Seemed clogged with pestilence.
         Wealth, too, I coveted,       And heaped its shining dust in hoards around me,       And yet it was but dust, as barren of       Enjoyment as the ground we tread upon.
       I clad myself in purple--heaped my board       With all the fairest, sweetest fruits of earth,       And filled my golden goblets with bright juice,       Pressed from the goodliest grapes, and made my couch       Of down, and yet, I was most wretched still.
       My garments were but cumbersome; my couch       Could give no rest, and e'en my generous wines       Could not remove the crushing weight that sat,       Nightmare-like, on my heart, until it grew       A palpable and keenly aching pang.
         There is, one path which yet remains untrod;       To be my guide in it, I called thee hither,--       'Tis that of knowledge.
         Spirit.
         The same       In which the mother of thy race was lost,       With e'en a wiser, mightier guide than I.
       She thirsted, too, for knowledge, and she gave       Her innocence--her home in Paradise--       The happiness of him--who shared her lot--       To know--what? That her own rebellious hand       Had raised the flood-gates of a sea of crime,       Which would for ever pour its bitter waves       Upon the helpless unprotected race,       Which her rash deed had ruined.
       Think of the sighs--the groans--the floods of tears--       The woes--too deep for these--which have no end,       Save but in heart-breaks! Think upon the toil--       The sweat--the pain--the strife--the crime--the blood--       The myriads of souls with which this one       Sad lesson was obtained! whose price is yet       Not fully paid, nor shall be so, until       The last poor son of earth mingles with dust!       Dost thou not fear to tread a path like this?         Werner.
         I have no fear;       It is so long since I have felt its thrill       That 'twere a pleasure now to feel it.
         Spirit.
         What wouldst thou know?       Thou art familiar with all earthly lore.
       More: Thou hast gained, and wield'st a power, to which       The rulers of the elements do bow;       The hurricane, at thy command goes forth,       Walking where'er thou bid'st it, and the storm       Ceases to howl when thou hast said,--"Be still!"       Thine anger stirs the ocean, and thy wrath       Finds out the deep foundations of the mountains,       And shakes them with its strength; the subtle fire,       That lights the tempest on its gloomy way,       Starts from its cloud-rocked slumber, at thy call,       To be thy messenger.
       Canst thou not be content when thou art feared       By those who rule a world? What is there yet       Which thy insatiate mind desires to know?       Would'st learn immortal mysteries? Reflect       Thou art but mortal.
         Werner.
         Spirit, why dost thou       Taunt me with my mortality? "Weak things,       Brought forth from earth,"--"Poor simple child of clay,"--       These are thy words, when well thou knows't that I,       Though bound to earth by bonds made of its mire,       Am mightier than thou.
 Were it not so,       Thou would'st not now be face to face with one       Of mortal birth.
 Thou, too, canst feel revenge,       And knowest how to wreak it; but, take heed,--       The power which brought thee hither, can, and may       Deal harshly with thee.
 If thou knowest aught       Worthy of an immortal mind to know,       To which I have not pierced, reveal thy knowledge.
         Spirit.
         We may not tell the secrets of eternity;       But I can show thee things thou hast not seen,       And they may profit thee, although 'twill shake       Even thy proud heart to look upon them.
       Would'st see them?         Werner.
         It is my wish.
         Spirit.
         Come then.
         Werner.
         Lead on;       Although thy path be through hell's gloomy gate,       I too will pass its portals at thy back.
       Thou canst not enter where I dare not pass.
         [The cloud closes around them, and moves away, and a voice sings       as it disappears.
         To the region of shadow,       The region of death,       Where dust is a stranger,       And life has no breath;       Where darkness and silence       Their dim shrouds have cast       Round the phantoms of worlds       That belong to the past;       Spirits who sit on       The thrones of the air,       Guide ye our chariot,       Waft ye us there.
         [Exeunt.
          ACT II.
         The verge of Creation.
 Enter Werner and Spirit.
         Werner.
         We have outtravelled light and sound:       The harmonies that pealed around us, as       Through yon array of dim and distant worlds       We winged our flight, have wholly died away,       Or come to us so faintly echoed, that       Our ears must watch and wait to catch them.
       Those stars are now like watch-fires, which though seen       Blazing afar, send not their light to make       The path of the benighted wanderer       More plain and cheerful.
       Before us stretches one vast field of gloom,       So dense as to appear impenetrable:--       Darkness, that has a body and a form,       Both palpable to touch and sight, across       Our path a barrier rears that seems to bar       Our farther progress.
 If there be, beyond       This wall of blackness, aught of mystery,       What power shall guide us to it?         Spirit.
         Thy mind       Which, from the influence of matter, free       As it is now and shall be till again       Though art returned unto thy native orb,       Is its own master, and its will is now       Its only needed guide.
       Strange things are hidden by that ebon veil,       To which a single wish of thine may bear us.
         Werner.
         Then let us on:       Since we our search for knowledge have begun,       Wherever there is aught that Power has made,       Which Time has ruined, or which Fate has damned,       There let us go, that we may look on it,       And learn its history.
 What intense glooms       We now are passing through! I feel them part       Before, and close behind us, as we fly,       As plainly as the swimmer feels the waves       That lave his gliding limbs.
 This sure must be       The home of Death--no voice, no sound, no sigh,       Not ev'n so much of breath as would suffice       To make a lily tremble!         Spirt.
         Though say'st true,       This is indeed the realm of Death,--at least       It has no more of life than what though hast       Brought here with thee,--I speak of mortal life:       We now are near the Hades of past worlds,       Whose spirits have a life which cannot die.
       You laugh! and show the haughty arrogance       Which in your mortal brethren you cotemn.
         Think you that he who gave to man his mind,       The undying spark that quickens his clay frame,       Would fashion from the same material       Such mighty wonders as the spheres which go       Hymning around his everlasting throne!       Giving to them a beauty which alone       Could be conceived by him, which has great hand       Alone could mould into reality,       And yet deny them what he gave to thee,       Intelligence! a thing that knows not death?       Hast though not seen thine earth put forth her leaves,       Clothing her rugged mountain tops and sides,       Her forests in the vale, each tree and shrub,       With a fair foliage? hast though not beheld       Her weaving, in the sunny springtide hours,       A fairy web of emerald-bladed grass       To robe her valleys in? With every flow'r       Of graceful form, and soft and downy leaf,       And tender hue, and tint, that Beauty owns,       To deck her gentle breast? When Autumn came,       With its rich gifts of pleasant, mellow fruits,       Hast though not seen her wipe her sunburnt brow,       And shake her yellow locks from every hill?       Hast though not heard her holy songs of peace       And plenty warbled from each vocal grove,       And murmured by her myriads of streams?       Hast though not seen her, when the hollow winds,       Which moan the requiem of the dying year,       Raved through her leafless bowers, wrap about       Her breast a mantle, wherewith to protect       And nurse the seed, the trusting husbandman       Hath given to her keeping? Are thine acts       As full of wisdom, and as free from blame?       If not, then why deny to her the life       And spirit you possess?         Werner.
         I did not laugh       In disbelief of what thy words declare,       But they stir such strange thoughts within my mind,       That, as I will not weep, I can but smile.
       Methinks the darkness has grown less profound,--       A heavy, dim, and shadowy light, like that       Which, when the storm has chosen midnight's hour       Of stilly gloom, to hold its revel in,       First glimmers through the clouds which have been rent,       And torn by their own fierceness, hands about us.
         The light increases still, and in the distance,       Enormous shadows, wearing distinct shapes,       Since seemingly immovable, and others       Like mighty, mastless, sailless, vessels, moved       By magic o'er a tideless, waveless ocean,       In calm, majestic silence float along!         Spirit.
       Let us go nearer,       Now what seest though?         Werner.
         Worlds like to that I live on, save that these       Seem made of living shades instead of dust;       Vast mountains, with tall trees and mighty rocks,       And fountains, gushing from their very summits;       Huge, towering cliffs, and deep and lonely glens,       And wide-mouthed caves that hold a deeper gloom,--       With precipices from whose edges soft       And silvery cataracts are leaping down;       Swift streams, that rush adown their rugged sides,       And quiet lakelets, that appear to sleep       In the embrace of the surrounding hills;       The cottage of the hardy hunter, perched       High on the rocks, like to an eagle's nest:       The shepherd's humble shieling, and his fold,       And, half-way up, broad vineyards, with their vines       Bending with purple clusters of ripe fruit;--       Wide valleys, with green meadows, and pure streams,       And gentle hills, where ripening harvests stand;       Majestic rivers, with their verdant banks       Studded with towns, and rural villages;       Motionless lakes, and seas without a wave,       And oceans pulseless as a dead man's heart!       And mighty cities, standing on their coasts,       With vasty walls and gilded palaces,       And giant tow'rs, and tapering spires, that seem       The guardians of all they overlook.
       Churchyards, with their pale gravestones, that appear       Like watchers of the dead whose names they bear!       All these are there, but not a sign of life,       No living thing that creeps along the ground,       Or flies the air, or swims the wave, is seen.
       It seems as if on all things some strong spell       Had in the twinkling of a star came down       And rocked them to an everlasting sleep!       Spirit! tell me if what I see is more       Than a delusion; if it be, whence came       These shades?         Spirit.
         And have I not already said       That these things are, that they are quick with life,--       Such life as disembodied spirits have,--       That they are deathless? Thou need'st not inquire       Of me whence they are come, for thou hast seen       One of their number on its journey hither.
         The period may not be far remote       When thine own planet, starting from its sphere,       Shall fright the dwellers of the stars that skirt       Its destined pathway to these silent realms!         Thou'st seen the comet rushing through the sky,       And, gazing on the glowing track which it       Had branded on the azure breast of space,       Thinking thy words were wisdom, thou hast said,       "When its full term of years has been fulfilled,       It shall return again.
" Not knowing that       The light thou sawest was reflected from       That sacred fire, which, in the end, shall purge       The spirit essence which pervades creation,       From the dull dust with which a wayward fate       Has clogged its being! Question me no more--       Remember what I said--I dare not tell       The secrets of Eternity.
 Look on       And learn whate'er thou canst.
         Werner.
           There is one thing which I at last have learned,--       To feel that with the increase of our knowledge       Our sorrows must increase.
 I oft have heard,       But never before have felt the truth of this.
         To know that were it not for this clay mask,       I even now might pierce the shadowy veil       That wraps in mystery the things I see,       And comprehend their secret principle,       Will make life doubly hard to bear, and tempt       Me much to shake it prematurely off,       And snatch wings for my spirit ere its time.
       A total ignorance were better than       The flash which from its slumber wakes the mind,       And then, departing, leaves it to itself,       In the wide maze of error, darkly groping.
         Wisdom is not the medicine to heal       A discontented mind.
 I now know more       Than when I left the earth, but feel that I       Have bought my knowledge with increase of sorrow.
         Spirit.
           Did I not tell thee that its path were steep,       And hard to climb, and thick beset with thorns,--       And that its tempting, longed-for fruit, tho' bought       With a great price, is full of bitterness?       If though art satisfied, let us retrace       Our way to earth again; wert thou to go       Yet farther on, thou might'st regret the more       Our coming hither.
         Werner.
           What! is there aught still more remote than these       From the great centre of the universe,--       The fair domain of life and living things?         Spirit.
         There is,--       A kingdom tenanted with such dark shapes,       That angels shudder when they look on them!       Thou surely dost not wish to visit it.
         Werner.
           Why not? There is within my mind a void       Whose vacant weight is harder to be borne       Than the keen stingings of more active pangs;       When it has traced the mystic chain of being       To its last link, it may perchance shake off       The misery of restless discontent,--       Its fulness then may sink it into rest.
         Spirit.
           I have no power to disobey thy word;       If thou wilt on, I must proceed with thee,       Even though in looking on I share the pangs       Of those who suffer.
         Werner.
           Come, then, I too must see them, tho' it cost       Me years of pain to gaze but for a moment.
         Spirit.
           'Twere harder now to find Eve's' buried dust,       Than to declare who has inherited       The largest portion of her prying spirit.
         (Sings.
)         Where Pain keepeth vigil         With Sorrow and Care,       And Horror sits watching         By dull-eyed Despair,--       Where the Spirit accurst         Maketh moan in its wo,       Thy wishes direct us,         And thither we go.
         [Exeunt.
          ACT III.
         Scene I.
 Near the place of the damned.
 Enter Werner and Spirit.
         Werner.
           What piercing, stunning sounds assail my ear!       Wild shrieks and wrathful curses, groans and prayers,       A chaos of all cries! making the space       Through which they penetrate to flutter like       The heart of a trapped hare,--are revelling round us.
         Unlike the gloomy realm we just have quitted,       Silent and solemn, all is restless here,       All wears the ashy hue of agony.
       Above us bends a black and starless vault,       Which ever echoes back the fearful voices       That rise from the abodes of wo beneath.
       Around us grim-browed desolation broods,       While, far below, a sea of pale gray clouds,       Like to an ocean tempest beaten, boils.
       Whither shall we direct our journey now?         Spirit.
           Right down through yon abyss of boiling clouds,       If though hast courage to attempt the plunge,       Our pathless way must be.
 A moment more       And we shall stand where angels seldom stand,       And devils almost pity when they stand,--       Behold!         Werner.
           Eternal God!       Whose being, is of love, whose band is pow'r,       Whose breath is life, whose noblest attribute,--       The one most worthy of thyself~-is mercy!       Were these of thine immortal will conceived?       Has thy hand shaped them out the forms they wear?       Has thy breath made them quick with, breathing life?       And is thy mercy to their wailings deaf?       Poor creatures! I bad deemed that in my breast       Grief had congealed the hidden fount of tears,       But ye have drawn them from their frozen source       And I do weep for you!         Spirit.
           What moves thee thus?       I thought thy heart so steeled in hardihood       Of universal hate, and pride, and scorn,       That even were the woes, which thou dost here       Behold endured by others, heaped on thee,       Thy haughty soul unmoved would feel them all;       Accounting its development of strength       To bear the worst decrees of ruthless fate,       Sufficient recompense!         Werner.
         Misdeem me not,       If I have wept involuntary tears       O'er pangs beyond my pow'r to mitigate,       Believe me, 'twas in pity, not in fear.
       But tell me, Spirit! is all hope extinct       In those who here sojourn, or do they look       Yet forward to some blest millennial day,       Which shall redeem them from this horrid place.
         Spirit.
         Best ask your theologians that question.
       Some say that there are places purgatorial,       Where Error pays the price of her transgressions       In sufferings that efface the effects of sin.
       And other some declare that when the soul       And clay are parted, heaven seals the doom       Of both, beyond repeal.
 Let thy own mind       Sit arbiter 'twixt these, and choose the truth.
       Mark what approaches us, and mark it well.
         Werner.
           I cannot turn my gaze from it, and yet       It makes the warm blood curdle in my veins.
       Than it, hell cannot hold a fouler form--       A thing of more unholy loathsomeness!       Its heavy eyes are dim and bleared with blood,       Its jaws, by strong convulsions fiercely worked,       Are clogged and clotted with mixed gore and foam!       A nauseous stench its filthy shape exhales,       And through its heaving bosom you may mark       The constant preying of a quenchless flame       That gnaws its heartstrings! while a harsh quick moan       Of mingled wrath, and madness, and despair,       Perpetually issues from its lips;--       And with unequal but unceasing steps,       It chases through the hot, sulphureous gloom,       A mocking phantom,--fair as it is foul!         With naked arms, white breast, and ebon locks,       And big black eyes that dart the humid flame       Which sets the heart ablaze; and red moist lips,       And checks as spotless as the falling flake       Ere it has touched the earth, and supple form       Wherein is knit each grace of womanhood       In its perfection! and with wanton looks       That speak the burning language of desire,       It seems to woo its loathsome follower,--       Yet ever from his foul embraces flies.
       And on his brow his name is written, "Lust!"         Dismiss the spectre, for it blasts my sight,       And sears my brain with its dark hideousness!         Spirit.
         'Tis gone; look up and see what next appears.
         Werner.
           A frame which may be that of Hercules,       It hath such giant members! and its port       Is martial as e'er marked a Caesar's moving.
       Its sandals are of brass, its massive brow       Is helmeted in steel, and in its hand       It bears a sword with which, in idle strokes,       It vainly beats the unresisting air,       As if in battle with some phantom foe;       And at each blow it deals, a strong fatality       Turns back its sword's keen point on its own breast,       Which deep it gashes,--then in mournful tone,       It mutters o'er and o'er again these words,--       "I fought for fame and won unending wo.
"       His agonies seem like himself, immortal.
         Spirit.
           Justice is blameless of his sufferings:       For many years his busy, plotting brain,       Made discord out of union, strife from peace,       And set the nations warring till the earth       Was crimson with the blood poured out for him!       He bears what he inflicted,--let him pass       And mark what follows him.
         Werner.
         A goodly shape,       More fit to string and strike Apollo's lyre,       Than bear the shield or wield the sword of Mars!       A broken harp, suspended at his side,       A faded garland, wreathed about his brow,       Tell what he was, and still employ his care.
       With thin white hand, that trembles at its task,       In vain he strives to bind the broken chords,       And to their primal melody attune them;--       In vain,--for to his efforts still replies       A boding strain of harsh, discordant sound.
       And then, with hot tears coursing down his cheeks,       He lifts his faded wreath from his pale brow,       And gazing on its withered leaves, exclaims,--       "For earthly fame I sung the songs of earth,       Forgetful of all higher, holier themes,--       'Tis meet the meed I won should perish thus.
"       Is not the justice which confines him here       Akin to cruelty? for his sad heart       Seems, as his earthly strains were, full of softness.
         Spirit.
           Each thought, and word, and deed of mortal man,       Is but a moral seed, which, in due season,       Must bring forth fruit according to its kind.
       The soil wherein those seeds are sown is Time,--         Death is the reaper of the ripened harvest,--       The fruits are garnered in Eternity,       To be, or good or bad, the spirit's food!       If then our thoughts, and words, and deeds have been       Of corrupt tendency, or evil nature,--       What marvel if we feed on bitterness?--       What shadow next appears?         Werner.
         An aged man,       Lean-framed and haggard-visaged, bowed beneath       The weight of years, or worldly cares that press       Still heavier than the iron hand of time.
       His tottering form is fearful to behold!       If the fierce scourge which men on earth call famine,       Could incarnate itself, methinks 'twould choose       Just such a shape, so worn and grim and gaunt,       And wo-begone of aspect.
 Groping round       He gathers from the burning floor of hell       Some shining pebbles, which his fond conceit       Transmutes to gold, and these with constant care       He watches, counting and recounting them,       Till suddenly a whirlwind, sweeping by,       Bears with it all his fancied hoards away,       Leaving him to renew his bootless task,       Which ever he renews with this complaint,--       "Alas! how speedily may wealth take wing.
"       And on his front his name is written, "Avarice.
"         Spirit.
           There yet is, in this shadowy land of shades,       One form which I would have thee look upon.
       Behold it cometh! mark and scan it well.
         Werner.
           Never before in all my wanderings       Through earth, or other regions, where abide       Things now no more of earth, have I beheld       Aught so profoundly mournful or so lone!       So dark a cloud o'erhangs his haggard brow,       That where he turns a dunner, murkier gloom       Prevails along hell's blasting atmosphere!         Surrounded by some goodly forms he moves,       Forms bright as his is dark, who each in turn       Woo his acceptance of the gifts they proffer.
       Love stretches out his dimpled band, wherein       He holds his emblematic rose, and Hope,       Bright Hope, that might renew again the pulse       Of life within the frozen veins of Death!       Beckons him to the future,--and calm Faith       Kindles beneath his eye her beacon blaze;       Yet, with such anguish as hell only holds,       He turns him from all these, and will not take       Love's proffered rose, lest 'neath its blushing leaves       Should lurk the stinging thorn of sly deceit.
         Hope's smile to him is disappointment's signal,--       And the bright beacon Faith so kindly lights       To guide us o'er the treacherous sea of life,       To him is but a cheat, a mockery,       An ignis fatuus, kindled to mislead.
         And yet he seems as one who in his life       Had nursed bright dreams, and cherished lofty aims,--       Had dreamed of love, or wooed Ambition's smiles,       Or to the sway of empires had aspired,       Or, higher still, the sway of human hearts!         Why gazest thou on me and not on him?         Spirit.
           To mark if in thine aspect I might not       Detect a consciousness that I thy own soul       Claimed brotherhood with his! Thou too hast scoffed       At human love, and hope, and faith, and truth,       Nursing within thy bosom pride, and scorn,       And rankling hate, I till these at length became       Fiends which thou could'st not master! Thou art warned,       Be wise and heed the warning.
 Let us now       Return unto thy far off, native orb,       O'er which the rosy smile of morn is breaking,       Waking its teeming millions to renew       Their daily rounds of toil and strife and crime.
         [Exeunt.
          ACT IV.
         Scene I.
 A peak of the Alps.
 Werner alone.
 Time, morning.
         Werner.
           How gloriously beautiful is earth!       In these her quiet, unfrequented haunts,       To which, except the timid chamois' foot,       Or venturous hunter's, or the eagle's wing,       Naught from beneath ascends.
 As yet the sun       But darts his earliest rays of golden light       Upon the summits of the tallest peaks,       Which robed in clouds and capped with glittering ice,       Soar proudly up, and beam and blaze aloft,       As if they would claim kindred with the stars!       And they may claim such kindred, for there is       Within, around, and over them, the same       Supreme, eternal, all-creating spirit       Which glows and burns in every beaming orb       That circles in immeasurable space!         Far as the eye can trace the mountain's crest       On either hand, a gorgeous, varied mass       Of glowing, cloud-formed ranges are at rest,       Reflecting back in every hue and tint,         Purple and crimson, orange and bright gold,       The sunny smile with which Morn hails the world.
         Beneath me all is quiet yet and calm,       For the dim shadow of the silent night       Still rests upon the valley, still the flock       Sleeps undisturbed within the guarded fold,       The lark yet slumbers in her lowly nest,       The dew hangs heavy upon leaf and blade,       The gray mist still o'erveils the unruffled lake,       And all is tranquil as an infant's sleep;       Tranquil around me, but not so within,       For in my breast a thousand restless thoughts       Conflict in wild, chaotical confusion.
       Thoughts of long bygone years, and things that were       But are no more, and thoughts that sternly strive       To grapple with the mysteries I late       Have looked upon; for I, since yesternight,       Have traversed the wide sea of space that rolls       Between the shores of this and other worlds;       Have gazed upon and scanned those worlds, or shades       That wear the lineaments of such; have seen       The damned in their own place, and marked the deep,       Terrific retribution Error brings       To such as are her votaries in life.
         And now I feel how baseless was my hope       That Peace, the solitary boon I crave,       Might spring from knowledge.
 Tis a fatal tree,       Which ever hath borne bitter fruit, since first       'Twas set in Paradise.
 But I must seek       The cottage of some honest mountaineer,       Who may afford me nurture and repose,       For I am weary, both in mind and frame.

         Rebecca.
           My boy! my beautiful, my dearest hope!       The garner where my trust of future joy       Is treasured.
 Heaven bless thee! May thy life,       If it seem good to Him who gave it, be       Blest to the fulness of a mother's prayer!         [She stoops to kiss him, and continues.
         How well his sleep portrays a quiet mind,       The embodied image of a sunny day,       A day without a cloud, whose only voices       Arise from sighing airs, and whispering leaves,       And tell-tale brooks that of their banks beseech       A gift, a wreath of their sweet flowers, wherewith       To soothe the angry Geni of the deep!       And free, glad birds that flit from bough to bough,       And ring their songs of love in the clear air,       Till heaven is filled with gushing melody,       And the all-glowing horizon becomes       A thing of life, whose breath is sweetest music!         [Kisses him again, and continues.
         His brow to me is as a spotless page,       Whereon is traced the story of my first       And only love, the bright and holy dream       That stole into my bosom, when beside       The crystal stream that threads a neighbouring vale,       I and his father watched our fathers' flocks,       And he would lay aside his shepherd's pipe,       And in low words, far sweeter than its music,       Talk of the sun and stars and gentle moon,       The earth and all its loveliness, the trees       And shrubs and flowers; how these were all pervaded       And quickened by the spirit of deep love;       Till, by the frequent blush that tinged my cheek,       The light that would break from my downcast eyes,       And the quick beat of my too happy heart,       Emboldened, he poured out his own pure passion,       On my enchanted ear! Since then my life       Has had no eras,--days, and months, and years,       Have all gone by uncounted, in the full,       Deep, fervent, soul-sufficing happiness,       Of all I prayed for, panted for, obtained!       But I must rouse him, it is time his flock       Should leave the fold, and--         [The boy starts and murmurs in his sleep.
         Down by yonder stream,       Where the green willows cluster thickest, there       They dwell.
 'Tis scarce so far as I could cast       A pebble from my sling.
 Seek it, and they       Will minister to thee what thou mayest need.
         [He awakes, and recognising his mother, exclaims--         Ah, mother! I have dreamed so strange a dream,       So strange, and yet so palpable, that I       Believed it a reality.
 Methought       As closely followed by my bleating flock,       I climbed the rugged mountain side where spring       Our greenest pastures, singing as I went,       I met a lonely wanderer in my way,       Of brow so pale, and eye so darkly sad,       That my own heart, to sadness little used,       Grew heavy at the sight; and he seemed worn       And very weary, not so much with toil       As by some hidden, inward strife of soul,       Which even then seemed raging in his breast.
         He stayed to question me where he might find       The cottage of some honest mountaineer,       Where he might crave the boons of rest and food,--       And mindful of the lesson taught by thee,       To give the hungry bread, the weary rest,       I pointed him to where our cottage stands,       Assuring him that thou and my sweet sister,--       Fair as aught earthly, and as pure as fair,--       Would entertain him as a welcome guest:       And so we parted.
         Rebecca.
         Thou didst well to mind       The lesson I so often have repeated.
       It is our first of duties to give aid       To those who beg for succour at our hands;       For we ourselves, whatever we possess,       Are but the stewards of the bounteous Lord       Who giveth to his creatures all good gifts.
       But it is time that thou shouldst seek the hills,       So take thy crook and pipe and hie away.

         When the Morning starts up from her couch on the deep,       Where through the dim night hours, she pillows her sleep,       I start from my slumbers, and hie me away       Where the white torrent dashes its feathery spray,--       I quaff the fresh stream as it bursts from the hill,--       I pluck the fresh flowers that spring by the rill,--       I watch the gray clouds as they curl round the peak       That rises high over them, barren and bleak;       And I think how the worldling who courts fortune's smile,       In his heart, like that peak, may be lonely the while;       And then my own heart sings aloud in its joy,       That Heaven has made me a free shepherd boy!         II.
         When the horn of the hunter resounds from on high,       Where the tall giant ice-cliffs ire piled to the sky,       Where, shunning the verdure of valleys and dells,       The brave eagle builds, and the shy chamois dwells,--       I list to its gay tones, as by me they float,       And I echo them merrily back, note for note;       With the wild bird a song full as gladsome I sing,       I crown me with flowers, and sit a crowned king,--       My flock are my subjects, my dog my vizier,       And my sceptre--a mild one--the crook that I bear;       No wants to perplex me, no cares to annoy,       I live an unenvying, free shepherdboy!         Werner (meets and addresses him).
         Thou'rt merry, lad.
         Albert.
         Ay, I have cause to be so.
       (Aside.
)       It is the wanderer of my last night's dream,       The same pale brow, and darkly mournful eye,       And weary gait, and melancholy voice,--       If he seeks friendly guidance, food, or shelter,       He shall not want them long.
         Werner.
         So thou hast cause       For merriment,--then thou perchance hast wealth,       Broad, fruitful lands, and tenements, and all       Which wealth confers.
         Albert.
         Nay, I have none of these,       And yet have more than all which thou hast named.
       I have a father, whose unsullied name       No tongue has ever spoken with reproach,       A mother, whose idea is with me       A holy thing, and a dear sister, who       Is fair as pure, and pure as is the snow       Upon the summit of the tallest peak       Of these my native mountains.
 I have health,       And strength, and food, and raiment, and employ,       And should I not then have a joyous heart?         Werner.
         Yea, verily thou shouldst.
         Albert.
         And there is yet,       Among the blessings Heaven has given to me,       One which I have not named to thee; it is       An humble home, whose hospitable door       Was never closed against the wayfarer,--       If thou hast need of aught which it affords,       Seek it, my mother and my sister will       Delight to minister unto thy wants.
       There where the wide-armed willows cluster thickest       Upon the green banks of yon crystal stream,       Our cottage stands.
 The path to it is short       And easily traversed,--so, now, farewell.
         Werner.
           Stay yet a moment.
 That which thou hast proffered,       Is what I sought.
 Thou hast a noble heart,       One fit to fill the bosom of a king,--       I fain would give thee guerdon,--here is gold.
         Albert.
           Keep it for those who covet it.
 If ever       Thou meet'st with one, bowed down by suffering,       Who calls on thee for pity and relief,       Then if thou heed'st his prayer for my sake,       I shall be well repaid.
 Again, farewell.
         {Exeunt.
         Scene IV.
 After a lapse of time.
 A rustic arbour near the       cottage of Manuel.
 Enter Rose and Werner.
         Rose.
           Nay, let my silent blushes plead with thee       That thou wilt be as silent.
         Werner.
         Rather let       My ardent love, which will not be repressed,       Plead with thee for acceptance of my suit;       For I do love thee with such passionate love,       That life itself, if weighed against that love,       Were scarce a feather in the scale.
         Rose.
         Alas!       I'm but a simple shepherd's simple child,       Unused to courtly speeches, and they say       That in the world thy name and rank are high,       And that when such as thou do proffer love       And faith to lowly maidens, 'tis a jest,--       And that when they have won our honest love,       They cast it from them with unpitying hands,       As idly as they would a withered flower.
         Werner.
         Nay, maiden, let me tell thee of the past,       Let me lay bare my heart beneath thy gaze,       And thou wilt pity if thou canst not love.
         I loved in youth with love as fond and deep       As ever made the heart of man its slave,       But, ere my hopes could ripen to fruition,       Death came and made my worshipped one his prize;       And though my peace departed when she died,       Yet I was proud, and would not bond to sorrow,       But with calm brow and eye, and smiling lip,       I mingled with the giddy thoughtless world,       Seeking from out its varied realms to wring       Some recompense for that which I had lost.
       Wealth, fame, and power, I sought for and obtained,       Yet found them only gilded mockeries.
       The paths of hidden knowledge I essayed,       And trod their mazy windings till they led       My footsteps--whither I may not disclose,--       But all availed me nothing, still my heart       Ached with the dreary void lost love had made,       Ached ever till that void was filled by thee!         Since first fate led me to your kindly door,       Three times the moon with full-orbed light hath shone,       Thrice thirty times, with song of merry birds       And breath of fragrance, Morn has blest the earth       And all its dwellers with her radiant presence;       Thrice thirty times, with star-bound brow, dim Night       Hath kept her tearful watch above the earth;       And every time the full-orb'd moon hath shone,       And every time the merry Morn hath smiled,       And every time dim Night with star-bound brow       Above the earth hath kept her tearful watch,       My heart has added to its store of love,       Its pure, deep, fervent, passionate love for thee!         By all my hopes of heaven, my words are true.
       Dost thou not pity now?         Rose.
         Ay, more! My heart,       And its full treasury of maiden love,       Never before surrendered to another,       I pledge to thee, as thine, for evermore!         [Exeunt.
         An Aerial Chorus.
         Seek the dell and seek the bower,       Pluck the bud and pluck the flower,         Search for buds of sweetest breath,       Search for flowers of brightest hue;         Fit to weave the bridal wreath,       Of a maid so fair and true.
         She has bowed the haughty heart,         Won the stubborn will from guile,       With no aid of other art         Than the sweet spell of her smile!         Seek the dell and seek the bower,       Pluck the bud and pluck the flower,         Search for buds of sweetest breath,       Search for flowers of brightest hue;         Fit to weave the bridal wreath,       Of a maid so fair and true!

      Note to the Misanthrope    "Then seek we, for the maiden's pillow,  Far beyond the Atlantic's billow,  Love's apple,--and when we have found it,  Draw the magic circles round it.
"    Considering the Mandrake, many fabulous notions were entertained  by the ancients; and they never attempted to extract it from the  earth, without the previous performance of such ceremonies as they  considered efficacious in preventing the numerous accidents, dangers,  and diseases, to which they believed the person exposed who was  daring enough to undertake its extraction.
 The usual manner of  obtaining it was this:--When found, three times a circle was drawn  around it with the point of a naked sword, and a dog was then  attached to it and beaten, until by his struggles it was disengaged  from the earth.
    It was supposed to be useful in producing dreams, philters, charms  &c.
; and also to possess the faculties of exciting love, and  increasing population.
    The Emperor Adrian, in a letter to Calexines, writes that he is  drinking the juice of the Mandrake to render him amorous: hence  it was called Love-apple.
    It grows in Italy, Spain, and the Levant.
          MISCELLANEOUS POEMS          TO ISABEL         A Beautiful Little Girl.
         Fair as some sea-child, in her coral bower,         Decked with the rare, rich treasures of the deep;       Mild as the spirit of the dream whose power         Bears back the infant's soul to heaven, in sleep       Brightens the hues of summer's first-born flower         Pure as the tears repentant mourners weep       O'er deeds to which the siren, Sin, beguiled,--       Art thou, sweet, smiling, bright-eyed cherub child.
         Thy presence is a spell of holiness,         From which unhallowed thoughts shrink blushing back,--       Thy smile is a warm light that shines to bless,         As beams the beacon o'er the wanderer's track,--       Thy voice is music, at whose sounds Distress         Unbinds her writhing victim from the rack       Of misery, and charmed by what she hears,       Forgets her woes, and smiles upon her tears.
         And when I look upon thee, bearing now         The promise of such loveliness, I ask       If time will blight, that promise; if thy brow,         So sunny now, will learn to wear the mask       Of hollow smiles, or cold deceit, whilst thou         Art learning in thy soul the bitter task       Time teaches to all bosoms, when the glow       Of hope is o'er--but this I may not know.
         My path will not be near to thine through life,--         Kind ones will guard and fondly shelter thee;       Me bitterness awaits, and care and strife,         And all that sorrow has of agony;       My future, as my past was, will be rife         With heartaches, and the pangs that "pass not by;"       Each hour shall give thee some new pleasure; years,       Long years can bring me only toil 'and tears.
         'Tis meet that it should be so,--I have made         A wreck of my own happiness, and cast       Across my heart, in youth, the dull, deep shade         That wrinkled age flings over all at last       But let it go,--I have too long delayed         The remedy, and what is past is past;--       And could I live those vanished moments o'er,       My heart would wander as it strayed before.
         I know not how it is,--my heart is stern,         And little giv'n to thoughts of tenderness;       Yet looking on thy young brow it will yearn,         And in my bosom's innermost recess,       Thoughts that have slumbered long awake and burn         With a wild strength which nothing can repress!       Be still, worn heart, be still; does not the cold       And heavy clay--clod mingle with her mould?         Yes, 'tis that in thy soft check's tender bloom,         Thy black eyes' brightness, in each graceful move,       I trace the lineaments of one to whom         My soul was wedded in an early love,--       'Twas in my boyhood; but the insatiate tomb         Claimed her fair form, and for the realms above       Her spirit fled the earth; oh! how I wept         That mine should in its bondage still be kept.
         I mind the hour I stood beside the clay         I had so loved in life--it still was fair,       Surpassing fair, in death; and as she lay         With the thick tresses of her long dark hair       Gathered above the brow whence feeling's ray         Had fled, because death's shadow darkened there,       Her more than earthly beauty made her seem       The incarnation of some pure bright dream.
         I stood and gazed: the pale grave sheet was wound         About the form from which life's spark was fled,       For ever fled,--wet eyes were weeping round,         And voices full of sorrow mourned the dead;       I could not weep; a sadness more profound         Than that from which those heart-drops, tears, are shed,       Was in my soul,--for then the icy spell       Of desolation freezing o'er me fell.
         And from that hour I have been alone,         Alone when crowds were round me.
 May thy fate       Be coloured with a brighter hue, and strown         With flowers where mine is thorns;--where mine is hate,       And strife, and bitter discord, may thine own         Be love, and hope, and peace--for these create       The sunshine of existence; may their light       Beam ever round thee, warm, and glad, and bright.
          THE LOCK OF HAIR.
         It is in sooth a lovely tress,         Still curled in many a ring,       As glossy as the plumes that dress         The raven's jetty wing.
       And the broad and soul-illumined brow,         Above whose arch it grew,       Was like the stainless mountain snow,         In its purity of hue.
         I mind the time 'twas given to me,         The night, the hour, the spot;       And the eye that pleaded silently,         "Forget the giver not.
"       Oh! myriads of stars, on high,         Were smiling sweetly fair,       But none was lovely as the eye         That shone beside me there!         Above our heads an ancient oak         Its strong, wide arms held out,       And from its roots a fountain broke,         With a tiny laughing shout;       And the fairy people of the wild         Were bending to their rest,       As trustingly as sleeps the child         Upon its mother's breast.
         Soft, silvery cloudlets, pure and white,         Along the sky were hung,       As if the spirits of the night         Their mantles there had flung;       And then the night-breeze pensively         Sighed from its unseen throne,       And far o'er field, and flower, and tree,         A hallowed light came down.
         But in our breasts was springing up         A something lovelier far,       Than field, or tree, or flow'ret's cup,         Or sun, or moon, or star!       We heeded not the fountain near,         Its song of gladness singing,       For in our hearts a fount more dear,         And pure, and sweet, was springing.
         And she was one whom fortune's smile         Had gladdened from her birth,       Yet her high spirit knew no guile,         No blot nor stain of earth;       And I was but a friendless boy,         And yet her heart was mine;       I knew it, and the thought was joy,         A joy all, all divine!         From out a braided mass she took         This single lock of jet,       And gave it with that pleading look         Which, said, "Do not forget.
"       Forget! as soon the waves that roll         The ocean's caves above,       May tell their secrets, as the soul         Forget its earliest love.
         It has been with me now for years,         Long years of care and strife,       And shall be with me till time wears         Away my web of life.
       And when death's keen, resistless dart,         Shall bid its sorrows cease,       This tress shall rest upon my heart,       Its talisman of peace.
           "'Twas little she thought that I stood breathless by her side       listening to the song she sang as she sat by the sea's edge,       pondering so deeply, upon me too perhaps, that the white foam       glimmered on her brow unheeded.
"         Onagh, The Pale Child of the Brehon King.
         She stood beside the wide wild sea,         The winds howled hoarse and high,       And dark clouds, drifting drearily,         Swept o'er the starless sky.
         Her breast was white as mountain snow,         Her locks hung loose and free,       The foam that glimmered on her brow,         Was scarce so pale as she.
         She sang a mournful song of love,         Of trusting love betrayed;       Ah, why did he who won her, prove         So faithless to the maid?         "Why pines my heart so wearily,         Why heaves my aching breast,       And why is sleep so far from me,         When others are at rest?         "Thou, truant wanderer o'er the deep,         The cause of all my cares;       For thee at night I wake and weep,         When none may mark my tears.
         "I seek the festive hall no more,         Its mirth no more I crave;       My heart is lonely as the shore,         And restless as the wave.
         "My soul has struggled to forget         Its sleepless, fatal flame;       I know thy vows were false, and yet         My love is still the same.
         "Still o'er the dream I nursed too well,         My bursting heart will yearn;       For ever with me must it dwell,--         Oh, wanderer, return!"         A white sail fluttered in the wind,         A light bark skimmed the sea,--       It came like hope across the mind,         As swift and silently.
         The shell-strewn beach that edged the main,         A manly footstep pressed;       The wanderer had returned again,--         The maiden's heart was blessed!          THE DESERTED.
         "Come, sit thee by my side once more,         'Tis long since thus we' met;       And though our dream of love is o'er,         Its sweetness lingers yet.
       Its transient day has long been past,         Its flame has ceased to burn,--       But Memory holds its spirit fast,         Safe in her sacred urn.
         "I will not chide thy wanderings,         Nor ask why thou couldst flee       A heart whose deep affection's springs         Poured forth such love for thee!       We may not curb the restless mind,         Nor teach the wayward heart       To love against its will, nor bind         It with the chains of art.
         "I would but tell thee how, in tears         And bitterness, my soul       Has yearned with dreams, through long, long, years,         Which it could not control.
       And how the thought that clingeth to,         And twineth round the past,       For ever in my heart shall glow,         And be save one my last.
         "They say thou hast another's love,--         Well, cherish it, but thou       Its lack of strength and depth wilt prove,         Should sorrow cloud thy brow.
       Though she may own a statelier form,         A fairer cheek than mine,       Her heart cannot so well and warm,         Respond each throb of thine.
"         Her words were gentle, but their tone         Was sad as sorrow's sigh,--       A tear-drop trembled in his own         As he sought her downcast eye.
       A chord was struck within his breast         That long untouched had lain,       Old memories started from their rest,--         The maid was loved again.
         Stanzas.
         On! there are hours of sadness, when the soul,         Torn from its every stay, and crushed beneath       Its many griefs, and spurning faith's control,         Pants with an earnest longing for the death       Which would for ever close its dark career,         With the pale shroud and the remorseless bier;       When the harsh, sterile nothingness of life,         First breaks upon the hope-deluded breast,       And the heart sickens with the bootless strife         That wrings its chords, and longs to be at rest;       Ev'n if the blow that frees it from distress,         Should strike it into utter nothingness.
         Ah, nothingness! The thought at times will come,         The mind will wrestle with the mystery       That clouds its being! from its clay-made home,         Its dwelling of a moment, it will flee       Into the far depths of the vast UNKNOWN,         In its vain searchings for th' eternal throne       Of that Omnipotence which gave it birth,         And, giving it a nature which might suit       A seraph, bound its destiny to earth!         And a few years, in which to eat the fruit       Of life's strange tree, so bitter at its core,         Then death, the quiet grave, sleep, and--what more?         Whence came we? whither go we? All is still         And voiceless in the past! A veil is drawn       Across the future! by life's mystic rill         We sit and ponder, watching for the dawn       Of some yet unconceived, far-reaching thought,       By which our nature's secret shall be taught!       Why sorrow is our element--why sin         Is native in us--by what curse we bear       An ever aching, crushing void within         Our secret souls! and why the little share       Of happiness that mingles with our fate,       Is of such fleeting, transitory date 1         Our loves! our hopes! what are they? fruits which turn         To ashes on our lips! illusive lights       That cast a moment's brightness while they burn,         Then die, and leave a darkness which affrights       Our spirits with its thrice redoubled gloom,       Making the sky a pall--the earth a tomb!       And yet these are the all of life for which         'Tis worth the wearing of its chain to know,       Wealth, fame, and power are but toys! the rich,         The high and mighty, with the base and low,       Alike before the reaper Death must fall,--       So be it! in the grave is rest for all.
         Stanzas.
         When the leaf is on the tree,         And the bird is in the bower,       And the butterfly and bee,         Bear its treasures from the flower;       When the fields put on the sheen,         That to young-eyed Spring belongs;       When the groves and forests green,         Echo with a thousand songs;         When wild Beauty wanders forth,         Giving, with no stinted care,       All her loveliness to earth,         All her sweetness to the air:       Then the heart, with gladness stirred,         Mindful of its griefs no more,       Mounts and carols, like a bird         When the pearly shower is o'er!         But the summer's sunny hours,         As we count them, pass away;       And its fairest fruits and flowers,         Are but food for stern decay.
       Then with wailings, deep and loud,         Like the sea's in its unrest,       Winter spreads his icy shroud,         O'er the bare earth's frozen breast.
         Thus the spirit's early gladness,         Sorrow chills or time removes;       And the soul, in tears and sadness,         Mourns its perished joys and loves.
       Hope will lose its trusting boldness,         One by one its beams depart,       And Despair, with icy, coldness,         Winds its mantle round the heart.

                     Press close your lips,       And bow your heads to earth, for Death is here!       Mark ye not how across that eye so clear,                   Steals his eclipse?                     A moment more,       And the quick throbbings of her heart shall cease,       Her pain-wrung spirit will obtain release,                   And all be o'er!                     Hush! Seal ye up       Your gushing tears, for Mercy's hand hath shaken       Her earth-bonds off, and from her lip hath taken                   Grief's bitter cup.
                     Ye know the dead       Are they who rest secure from care and strife,--       That they who walk the thorny way of life,                   Have tears to shed.
                     Ye know her pray'r,       Was for the quiet of the tomb's deep rest,--       Love's sepulchre lay cold within her breast,                   Could peace dwell there?                     A tale soon told,       Is of her life the story; she had loved,       And he who won her heart to love, had proved                   Heartless and cold.
                     Lay her to rest,       Where shines and falls the summer's sun and dew;       For these should shine and fall where lies so true                   And fond a breast!                     A full release       From every pang is given to the dead,--       So on the stone ye place above her head,                   Write only "Peace.
"                     When Spring comes back,       With music on her lips,--joy in her eye,--       Her sunny banner streaming through the sky,--                   Flow'rs in her track--                     Then come ye here,       And musing from the busy world apart,       Drop on the turf that wraps her mouldering heart,                   Sweet Pity's tear.
     The most touchingly beautiful epitaph I have ever read, was written in  that one word, "Peace.
" It seemed like the last sigh of a departing  spirit, over the clay which it was about to abandon for ever.
          LOVE AND FANCY.
              "Whenever, amid bow'rs of myrtle,              Love, summer-tressed and vernal-eyed,            At morn or eve is seen to wander,              A dark-haired girl is at his side.
"            De La Hogue.
         One morn, just as day in the far east was breaking,         Young Love, who all night had been roving about,       A charming siesta was quietly taking,         His strength, by his rambles, completely worn out.
         Round his brow a wreath, woven of every flower         That springs from the hillside, or valley, was bound;       In his hand was a rose he had stol'n from some bower,         While his bow and his quiver lay near on the ground.
         Wild Fancy just came from her kingdom of dreams,         The breath of the opening day to enjoy,       And to catch the warm kiss of its first golden beams         On her cheek, caught a glimpse of the slumbering boy!         With a light, noiseless step she drew near to the sleeper,         And gazed till her snowy-breast heaved a soft sigh;       Then she bade sleep's dull god bring a sounder and deeper         And heavier trance for Love's beautiful eye.
         Then back to her shadowy kingdom she flow,         And called up the bright mystic forms she has there;       And filling an urn from a fountain of dew,         She bade them all straight to Love's couch-side repair.
         They came, and stood round, as her hand, o'er his pillow,         From a chalice of pearl, poured its magical stream:       While his red rosy lips, that now sighed like a billow         At play with the breeze, told how sweet was his dream.
         He dreamed that he sat on a shining throne, wrought         Of the purest of gold that the earth could supply,       While a trio of beautiful maids, who each brought         A gift for his shrine, in succession past by.
         First Fame, with the step and the glance of a queen,         Came up, and before him bent down her proud knee,       And held up a garland, whereon played the sheen         Of the beams which insure immortality!         Next Wealth, the stern mistress of men, for whose smile         They toil like the galley slave,--brought in her hand       The fair gems of many an ocean isle,         And the diamonds of many a far off land.
         And Beauty came too, with her blue, laughing eye,         Her fair flowing locks, and her soft rosy cheek,       And red lips, whose sweet smile told silently         The tale which they seemed ashamed to speak.
         'Neath the shade of a palm branch a fourth one stood by,         With locks like in hue to the tresses of Night,       With a pale, pensive brow, and a dark dreamy eye,         Where the soul of sweet softness lay gleaming in light!         It was Fancy: Love gazed, and his eager eye shone         With a lustre of feeling, deep, fervent, and sweet;       And he thought it were better to give up his throne         For a place, on his knees, at the coy maiden's feet.
         And from that bright hour, through calm and through storm,         Through the sunlight of summer, and winter's dark reign,       These twain have been bound by ties, tender and warm,         Which ne'er through all time shall be severed again.
         And ever where Love weaves his fond witchery,         Will Fancy the aid of her brightness bestow,       And give the loved object, whatever it be,         A purer, a dearer, a heavenlier glow!          LINES WRITTEN IN A YOUNG LADY'S ALBUM         'Tis not in youth, when life is new, when but to live is sweet,       When Pleasure strews her starlike flow'rs beneath our careless feet,       When Hope, that has not been deferred, first waves its golden wings,       And crowds the distant future with a thousand lovely things;--         When if a transient grief o'ershades the spirit for a while,       The momentary tear that falls is followed by a smile;       Or if a pensive mood, at times, across the bosom steals,       It scarcely sighs, so gentle is the pensiveness it feels         It is not then the, restless soul will seek for one with whom       To share whatever lot it bears, its gladness or its gloom,--       Some trusting, tried, and gentle heart, some true and faithful breast,       Whereon its pinions it may fold, and claim a place of rest.
         But oh! when comes the icy chill that freezes o'er the heart,       When, one by one, the joys we shared, the hopes we held, depart;       When  friends, like autumn's withered leaves, have fallen by our side,       And life, so pleasant once, becomes a desert wild and wide;--         As for her olive branch the dove swept o'er the sullen wave,       That rolled above the olden world--its death-robe and its grave!--       So will the spirit search the earth for some kind, gentle one,       With it to share her destiny, and make it all her own!          TO A LADY.
         Suggested By Hearing Her Voice During Services At Church.
         At night, in visions, when my soul drew near         The shadowy confines of the spirit land,       Wild, wondrous notes of song have met my ear,         Wrung from their harps by many a seraph's hand;       And forms of light, too, more divinely fair         Than Mercy's messenger to hearts that mourn,       On wings that made sweet music in the air,         Have round me, in those hours of bliss, been borne,       And, filled with joy unutterable, I       Have deemed myself a born child of the sky.
         And often, too, at sunset's magic hour,         When musing by some solitary stream,       While thought awoke in its resistless pow'r,         And restless Fancy wove her brightest dream:       Mysterious tongues, that were not of the earth,         Have whispered words which I may not repeat,--       But Thought or Fancy ne'er have given birth         To form and voice like thine,--so fair and sweet!       Nor have I found them when my spirit's flight       Had borne me to the far shores of delight.
         Above the murmurs of an hundred lips,         They rose, those silvery tones of praise and pray'r,       Soft as the light breeze, when Aurora trips         The earth, and, lighting up the darkened air,       Carols her greetings to the waking flow'rs!         They fell upon my heart like summer rain       Upon the thirsting fields,--and earlier hours,         When I too breathed th' adoring pray'r and strain,       Came back once more; the present was beguiled       Of half its gloom, and my worn spirit smiled.
         Pray, lady, that the sad, soul-searing blight,         Which comes upon us when we tread the ways       Of sin, may not be suffered to alight         On thy pure spirit in its youthful days;       Or like the fruitage of the Dead Sea shore,         Tho' outward bloom and freshness thou may'st be,       Stern bitterness and death will gnaw thy core,         And thou wilt be a heart-scathed thing like me,       Bearing the weight of many years, ere thou       Hast lost youth's rosy cheek and lineless brow.
          IMPROMPTU,       On The Reception Of A Letter.
         I would love to have thee near me,         But when I think how drear       Is each hope that used to cheer me,         I cease to wish thee here.
         I know that thou, wouldst not shrink from         The storms that burst on me,       But the bitter chalice I drink from,         I will not pass to thee.
         I would share the world with thee, were it         With all its pleasures mine,       But the sorrows which I inherit,         I never will make thine!          THE OLD MAN AND THE BOY.
         "Glenara, Glenara, now read me my dream.
"       Campbell.
         Father, I have dreamed a dream,         When the rosy morning hour       Poured its light on field and stream,         Kindling nature with its pow'r;--         O'er the meadow's dewy breast,         I had chased a butterfly,       Tempted by its gaudy vest,         Still my vain pursuit to ply,--         Till my limbs were weary grown,         With the distance I had strayed,       Then to rest I laid me down,         Where a beech tree cast its shade,         Soon a heaviness came o'er me,         And a deep sleep sealed my eyes;       And a vision past before me,         Full of changing phantasies.
         First I stood beside a bower,         Green as summer bow'r could be;       Vine and fruit, and leaf and flower,         Mixed to weave its canopy.
         And within reclined a form,         As embodied moonlight fair,       With a soft cheek, fresh and warm,         Deep blue eye and sunny hair.
         By her side a goblet stood,         Such as bacchanalians brim;       High the rich grape's crimson blood,         Sparkled o'er its gilded rim.
         As I gazed, she bowed her head,         With a gay and graceful move,       And in words of music said,         "Drink, and learn the lore of love!"         Next I stood beside a mountain,         Of majestic form and height;       Cliff and crag, and glen and fountain,         Mingled to make up its might.
         On its lofty brow were growing         Flowers never chilled by gloom,       For the sky above them glowing,         Dyed them with a deathless bloom.
         And I saw the crystal dome,         Wondrous in its majesty,       Where earth's great ones find a home,         When their spirits are set free.
         By its portals, I espied         One who kept the courts within;       High he waved a wreath and cried,         "Come up hither,--strive and win!"         Then my vision changed again:         In a fairy-coloured shell,       O'er the wide sea's pathless plain,         I was speeding, fast and well.
         Suddenly, beneath its prow,         Parted were the azure waves,       And I saw where, far below,         Yawn the vast deep's secret caves.
         Where the Syren sings her song,         To old Ocean's sons and daughters;       And the mermaids dance along,         To the music of the waters.
         Where the coral forest o'er,         Storm or tempest ne'er is driven       And the gems that strew its floor,         Sparkle like the stars in heaven.
         Treasures, such as never eye         Of the earth has looked upon,       Gold and pearls of many a dye,         There in rich profusion shone.
         And a voice came to my ear,         Saying, in a stern, cold tone,       Such as chills the heart with fear,         "Seize and make the prize thine own.
"         Then across a clouded wild,         Lone and drear and desolate,       Where no cheerful cottage smiled,         I pursued the steps of fate.
         Ever bearing in my breast,         Thoughts almost to madness wrought;       Ever, ever seeking rest,         Never finding what I Sought--         Till I gave my wanderings o'er,         By a black and icy stream,--       Deep I plunged and knew no more:--         Father, read me now my dream.
         The old man bowed his head,       And pressed his thin hand to his withered brow,       As if he struggled with some rising thought       Which should have kept its place in memory's urn       Till he had cast the shadow from his soul,       Which for a while had bound it in a spell       Born of the bygone years,--then thus he spoke:         Now listen, boy, and I will show to thee         The import of thy vision,--I will tell       Thee what its scenes and shapes of mystery         Foreshadow of the future,--for full well       I know the wizard lore, whose witchery         Binds e'en the time to come in its wild spell!       And from approaching years a knowledge wrings       Of what they bear upon their viewless wings.
         Along life's weary way of pain and care,         From earliest infancy to eldest age,       Forms, viewless as the soft-breathed summer air,         Attend man's footsteps in his pilgrimage;       And if his destiny be dark or fair,         If Pleasure gilds, or Sorrow blots the page       Whereon is traced his history, still his ear       Will ever catch their warning voices near.
         And they--those guardian ones, who, while thy sleep         Hung o'er thee like a curtain, came around       And fanned thee till thy slumber grew more deep,--         Flung o'er thy rest, so perfect and profound,       A dream whose mem'ry thou shouldst ever keep         Bound to thy spirit, for altho' it wound,       Thy young heart now, perchance, in after years,         'Twill save thee much of toil, and many tears.
         It was a dream of life: of boyhood's strong         And soul-consuming yearnings after love!       His eager search to find, amid the throng,         Some heart to give him thought for thought--to move       And mingle with his own, as twines the song         From Beauty's lyre and lips! to know and prove       The dearest joy to care-cursed mortals given,       The one with least of earth, and most of heaven         Of manhood's ceaseless strivings after fame,--         The veriest phantom of all phantasies--       For which he wields the sword, or lights the flame         Whose red glare mocks a nation's agonies,--       Or by his star-outwatching taper, plies         His pen or pencil, to gain--what? a name,       A passing sound--an echo--a mere breath,       Which he, vain fool, dreams mightier than death!         And of a later period, when the soul         Forsakes its high resolves and wild desires,       When stern Ambition can no more control,         And Love has shrouded o'er its smothered fires;       When Expectation ceases to console,         And Hope, the last kind comforter, expires;       And Avarice, monster of the gilded vest,       Creeps in and occupies the vacant breast.
         And then the last sad scene: The sick heart, sore         And fainting from its wounds--the palsied limb--       The brow whose death-sweat peeps from every pore--         The eye with its long, weary watch grown dim--       The withered, wan cheek, that shall bloom no more--         The last dregs dripping slowly from the brim       Of life's drained cup,--behind all gloom, before       A deep, dark gulf--we plunge, and all is o'er!          ACLE AT THE GRAVE OF NERO.
    It is a circumstance connected with the history of Nero, that every  spring and summer, for many years after his death, fresh and beautiful  flowers were nightly scattered upon his grave by some unknown hand.
    Tradition relates that it was done by a young maiden of Corinth, named  Acle, whom Nero had brought to Rome from her native city, whither he had  gone in the disguise of an artist, to contend in the Nemean, Isthinian,  and Floral games, celebrated there; and whence he returned conqueror in  the Palaestra, the chariot race, and the song; bearing with him, like  Jason of old, a second Medea, divine in form and feature as the first,  and who like her had left father, friends, and country, to follow a  stranger.
    Even the worse than savage barbarity of this sanguinary tyrant, had not  cut him off from all human affection; and those flowers were doubtless  the tribute of that young girl's holy and enduring love!         Whose name is on yon lettered stone? whose ashes rest beneath?       That thus you come with flowers to deck the mournful home of death;       And thou--why darkens so thy brow with grief's untimely gloom?       Thou art fitter for a bride than for a watcher by the tomb!         "It is the name of one whose deeds made men grow pale with fear,       And Nero's, stranger, is the dust that lies sepulchred here;       That name may be a word of harsh and boding sound to thee,       But oh! it has a more than mortal melody for me!         "And I,--my heart has grown to age in girlhood's fleeting years,       And has one only task--to bathe its buried love in tears;       The all of life that yet remains to me is but its breath;       Then tell me, is it meet that I should seek the bridal wreath?"         But maiden, he of whom you speak was of a savage mood,       That took its joy alone in scenes, of carnage, tears and blood;       His dark, wild spirit bore the stain of crime's most loathsome hue,       And love is for the high of soul--the gentle and the true.
         "The voice that taught an abject world to tremble at its words,       To me was mild and musical, and mellow as a bird's--       A bird's--that couched among the green, broad branches of the date,       Tells, in its silvery songs, its gushing gladness to its mate.
         "I saw him first beside the sea; near to ray father's home,       When like an ocean deity he bounded from the foam;       Ev'n then a glory seemed to breathe around him as he trod,       And my haughty soul was bowed, as in the presence of a God.
         I knew not, till my heart was his, the darkness of his own,       Nor dreamed that he who knelt to me was master of a throne!       And when the fearful knowledge came, its coming was in vain,--       I had forsaken all for him, and would do so again.
"         Is love the offspring of the will? or is it, like a flower,       So frail that it may fade and be forgotten in an hour?       No, no! it springs unbidden where the heart's deep fountains play,       And cherished by their hallowed dew, it cannot pass away!          THE VENETIAN GIRL'S EVENING SONG.
         Unmoor the skiff,--unmoor the skiff,--         The night wind's sigh is on the air,       And o'er the highest Alpine cliff,         The pale moon rises, broad and clear.
       The murmuring waves are tranquil now,         And on their breast each twinkling star       With which Night gems her dusky brow,         Flings its mild radiance from afar.
         Put off upon the deep blue sea,         And leave the banquet and the ball;       For solitude, when shared with thee,         Is dearer than the carnival.
       And in my heart are thoughts of love,         Such thoughts as lips should only breathe,       When the bright stars keep watch above,         And the calm waters sleep beneath!         The tale I have for thee, perchance,         May to thine eye anew impart       The long-lost gladness of its glance,         And soothe the sorrows of thy heart;       Come, I will sing for thee again,         The songs which once our mothers sung,       Ere tyranny its galling chain         On them, and those they loved, had hung.
         Thou'rt sad; thou say'st that in the halls         Which echoed once our father's tread,       The stranger's idle footstep falls,         With sound that might awake the dead!       The mighty dead! whose dust around         An atmosphere of reverence sheds;       If aught of earthly voice or sound,         Might reach them in their marble beds.
         That she to whom the deep gave birth,--         Fair Venice! to whose queenly stores       The wealth and beauty of the earth         Were wafted from an hundred shores!       Now on her wave-girt site, forlorn,         Sits shrouded in affliction's night,--       The object of the tyrant's scorn,         Sad monument of fallen might.
         Well, tho' in her deserted halls         The fire on Freedom's shrine is dead,       Tho' o'er her darkened, crumbling walls,         Stern Desolation's pall is spread;       Is not the second better part,         To that which rends the despot's chain,       To wear it with a dauntless heart,         To feel yet shrink not from its pain?         Then let the creeping ivy twine         Its wreaths about each ruined arch,       Till Time shall crush them in the brine,         Beneath its all-triumphant march!       Then let the swelling waters close         Above the sea-child's sinking frame,       And hide for ever from her foes,         Each trace and vestige of her shame.
         Shall we at last less calmly sleep,         When in the narrow death-house pent,       Because the bosom of the deep         Shall be our only monument?       No! by the waste of waters bid,         Our tombs as well shall keep their trust,       As tho' a marble pyramid         Were piled above our mangled dust!    Written in the National Gallery, at the city of Washington, on looking  at a Mummy, supposed to have belonged to a race extinct before the  occupation of the Western Continent by the people in whose possession  the Europeans found it.
         Sole and mysterious relic of a race       That long has ceased to be, whose very name,       Time, ever bearing on with steady pace,       Has swept away from earth, leaving thy frame,       Darkened by thirty centuries, to claim,       Among the records of the things that were,       Its place,--Tradition has forgot thee--Fame,       If ever fame was thine, has ceased to bear       Her record of thee,--say, what dost thou here?         Three thousand years ago a mother's arms       Were wrapped about that dark and ghastly form,       And all the loveliness of childhood's charms       Glowed on that cheek, with life then flushed and warm;       Say, what preserved thee from the hungry worm       That haunts with gnawing tooth the gloomy bed       Spread for the lifeless? Tell what could disarm       Decay of half its power, and while it fed       On empires--races--make it spare the dead!         How strange to contemplate the wondrous story,       When those deep sunken eyes first saw the light,       Lost Babylon was in her midday glory,--       Upon her pride and power had fall'n no blight;       And Tyre, the ancient mariner's delight,       Whose merchantmen were princes, and whose name       Was theme of praise to all, has left her site       To utter barren nakedness and shame,--       Yet thou, amid all change, art still the same.
         And she who, by the "yellow Tiber's" side,       Sits wrapped in her dark veil of widowhood,       With scarce a glimmer of her ancient pride,       To cheer the gloom of that deep solitude       Which o'er the seat of vanquished pow'r doth brood,       Since thou wast born has seen her glories rise,       Burn, and expire! quenched by the streams of blood       Which her slaves drew from her own veins, the price       Of usurpation, proud Ambition's sacrifice!         And darker in her fate, and sadder still,       The sacred city of the minstrel king,       That proudly sat on Zion's holy hill,       The wonder of the world! Destruction's wing       Hath from her swept each fair and goodly thing;       Her palaces and temples! where are they?       Her walls and marble tow'rs lie mouldering,       Her glory to the spoiler's hand a prey,--       And yet time spares a portion of thy clay!         And thou art here amid a stranger race,       To whom these shores four centuries ago,       Tho' now proud Freedom's boasted dwelling-place,       Were all unknown; the wide streams that now flow       Where Cultivation's hand has steered her plough,       Had then but seen the forest huntsman guide       His light canoe across the waves which now       Reflect the snowy sails that waft in pride       The stately ship along their rippling tide.
         Thou art the silent messenger of ages,       Sent back to tread with Time his constant way,       To shame the wisdom of conceited sages,       Whose lore is but a thing of yesterday;       What would their best, their brightest visions weigh       Beside the fearful truths thou couldst reveal?       The secrets of eternity now lay       Unveiled before thee, and for we or weal,       Thy doom is fixed beyond ev'n heaven's repeal.
         I will not ask thee of the mysteries       That lie beyond Death's shadowy vale; but thou       Mayst tell us of the fate the Destinies       Wove for thine earthly sojourn.
 Was thy brow       Graced with the poet's, hero's garland? How       Dealt Fortune with thee? Did she curse or bless       Thee with her frown or smile? Speak! thou art now       Among the living,--they around thee press.
       Still silent? Then thy lot we can but guess.
         Perhaps thou wast a monarch, and hast worn       The sceptre of some real El Dorado!       Perhaps a warrior, and those arms have borne       The foremost shield, and dealt the deadliest blow       That drew the life-blood of a warring foe!       Perhaps thou wor'st the courtier's gilded thrall,--       Some glittering court's gay, proud papilio!       Perchance a clown, the jester of some hall,       The slave of one man, and the fool of all!         Oh life! and pride! and honour! come and see       To what a depth your visions tumble down!       Behold your wearer,--who shall say if he       Were monarch, warrior, parasite, or clown!       And ye, who talk of glory and renown,       And call them bright and deathless! and who break       Each dearer tie to grasp fame's gilded crown,       Come, hear instruction from this shadow speak,       And learn how valueless the prize ye seek!         See where ambition's loftiest flight doth tend,       Behold the doom perhaps of blood-bought fame,       And know that all which earth can give must end,       In dust and ashes, and an empty name!       Ye passions! which defy our pow'r to tame       Or curb your headlong tides, behold your home!       Love! see the breast where thou didst light thy flame!       Immortal spirit! see thy shattered dome!       When shall its hour of renovation come?         Shall life possess, and beauty deck again       That withered form, and foul and dusky cheek?       Will Death resign his dull and frozen reign,       And the immortal soul return to seek       Her long-deserted dwelling, and to break       The bondage which has held in icy chains       All that was mortal of thee? will she make       Her home in thee, and shall these poor remains       Share with her heaven's pleasures or hell's pains?         Wonder of wonders! who could look on thee       And afterward survey with curious eye       The mouldering shrines where dupes have bent the knee,       Where superstition, by hypocrisy       Nurtured and fed with tales of mystery,       Has oft with timid footstep trembling trod,--       All these are worse than nothing; come and see       Where once a deathless soul held its abode,--       The wrecked and ruined palace of a God!         Farewell! Not idly has this hour been spent.
       Thy silent teachings I may not forget,--       More deeply, strangely, truly eloquent,       Than all the babbled words which ever yet       Have fall'n from living lips,--they shall be set       With the bright gems which Wisdom loves to keep;       And when my spirit against fate would fret,       My eyes shall turn to thee and cease to weep,       Till I too sleep death's deep and dreamless sleep!          TO ISABEL.
         Come near me with thy lips, and, breathe o'er mine         Their breath, for I consume with love's desire,--       Thine ivory arms about me clasp and twine,         And beam upon mine eye thine eye's soft fire;       Clasp me yet closer, till my heart feels thine         Thrill, as the chords of Memnon's mystic lyre       Thrilled at the sun's uprising! thou who art       The lone, the worshipped idol of my heart!         There! balmier than the south wind, when it brings         The scent of aromatic shrub and tree,       And tropic flower on ifs glowing wings,         Thine odorous breath is wafted over me;       How to thy dewy lips mine own lip clings,         And my whole being is absorbed in thee;       And in my breast thine eyes have lit a fire       That never, never, never shall expire!         Eternal--is it not eternal--this        Our passionate love? what pow'r shall part us twain?       Not even Death! Life could bestow no bliss         Like death with thee, and I would rend its chain       If thou shouldst perish, for my heaven is         To gaze upon thee! I could bear all pain       Unsighing, so not parted from thy side,       My beautiful! my spirit's chosen bride!         They try to woo me from thy fond embrace,         To lure me from the light of those dear eyes;       They tell me that in fortune's arduous chase,         I have such fleetness as would win the prize;--       But all the pomps of circumstance and place,         A glance, a word, a smile of thine outvies!       Leave Fortune to her parasites! mine be       The blessed lot to dwell with love and thee.
         To lead thee on through life, and to enlarge         Thy soul with added knowledge, day by day,       To guard thee, as an angel guards his charge,         From every ill that lurks along the way!       To smooth that rugged way, and strew its marge         With the bright flowrs that never can decay,--       This were a lot too glorious, too divine,       And yet Hope whispers that it shall be mine.
         Now listen, love,--this plan shall rule my life         And thine:--In some remote and sunny dell,       Far from the crowded city's silly strife,         My hands shall rear the home where we will dwell;       Shall till the soil, with fertile fruitage rife,         And teach the golden ear to shoot and swell;       And my sole wished for recompense shall be       My ever growing, deep'ning love for thee.
         Thy task shall be to train the trailing vine,         To watch, and cherish in its growth, the flow'r       Whose breath and cheek are sweet and fair as thine;         To bless and brighten the domestic bow'r       Where we will build to Love a hallowed shrine,         And bow us, in his worship, every hour;       Till, chastened by thy smile, my heart has grown       As pure, and soft, and sinless as thine own.
         Oh, hasten, love! to realize the dream,--         Come from the world,--the crowd is not for thee;       Forsake it then, ere the contagious steam         Of its foul breath has soiled thy purity;--       Come, for my heart would burst could I but deem         That such as they are, thou couldst ever be!       Come, for my soul adores thee with a love       As burning as the seraphs feel above.
      These lines are inscribed to the memory of John Q.
 Carlin, killed  at Buena Vista.
         Warrior of the youthful brow,         Eager heart and eagle eye!       Pants thy soul for battle now?         Burns thy glance with victory?       Dost thou dream of conflicts done,       Perils past and trophies won?       And a nation's grateful praise       Given to thine after days?         Bloodless is thy cheek, and cold         As the clay upon it prest;       And in many a slimy fold,         Winds the grave-worm round thy breast.
       Thou wilt join the fight no more,--       Glory's dream with thee is o'er,--       And alike are now to thee       Greatness and obscurity.
         But an ever sunny sky,         O'er thy place of rest is bending;       And above thy grave, and nigh,         Flowers ever bright are blending.
       O'er thy dreamless, calm repose,       Balmily the south wind blows,--       With the green turf on thy breast,       Rest thee, youthful warrior, rest!         When the alarum first was sounded,         Marshalling in arms the brave,       Forth thy fearless spirit bounded,         To obtain thee--what? A grave!       Fame had whispered in thine ear,       Words the high-souled love to hear,--       But the ruthless hand of death       From thee snatched the hero's wreath.
         Often will the grief-shade start         O'er thy sister's mood of joy,       Vainly will thy mother's heart         Yearn to greet her absent boy;       Never sister's lip shall press       On thine own its fond caress,--       Never more a mother's eye       Flash in pride when thou art by!         Where the orange, bending lowly         With its golden fruit, is swaying;       And the Indian maiden, slowly         By her native stream is straying;       O'er thy dreamless, calm repose,       Balmily the South wind blows,--       With the green turf on thy breast,       Rest thee, youthful warrior, rest!          A LEGEND OF THE HARTZ.
         Many ages ago, near the high Hartz, there dwelt       A rude race of blood-loving giants, who felt       No joy but the fierce one which Carnage bestows,       When her foul lips are clogged with the blood of her foes.
         And fiercer and bolder than all of the rest       Was Bohdo,(1) their chieftain;--'twas strange that a breast,       Which nothing like kindness or pity might move,       Should glow with the warmth and the rapture of love.
         Yet he loved, and the pale mountain-monarch's fair child       Was the maid of his heart; but tho' burning and wild       Was the love that he bore her, it won no return,       And the flame that consumed him was answered with scorn.
         Now the lady is gone with her steed to the plain,--       Save the falcon and hound there is none in her train;       She needs none to guide, or to guard her from harm       There's no fear in her heart, there is strength in her arm.
         From her white wrist unhooded her falcon she threw,       Her bow like Diana, the huntress, she drew;       And fleet as the fetterless bird swept the sky,       So on her proud steed swept the fair lady by.
         See how her eye sparkles, and how her cheek glows,       As onward so fearless and proudly she goes,       With her locks streaming back like a banner of gold,       Were she not, say, a bride meet for Nimrod(2) of old?         And he saw her--the chief, from his tower afar--       As she glanced o'er the earth like some wandering star;       And he swore she should come in that tower to dwell,       Or his soul be a prize to the spirits of hell.
         His war-horse he mounted, and, swift as the shoot       Of the night-gathered meteor, he sped in pursuit,--       Breathing out, as he went, mad with love and with hate,       Bitter curse upon curse against heaven and fate.
         Urging on his fleet courser with spur and with rein,       He swept o'er the earth as the storm sweeps the plain,--       And the fair lady knew, by the gleam of his shield,       It was Bohdo, the scourge of the red battle field!         Then spurred she her steed over valley and hill,       Over rock, marsh and moor, over river and rill,       Yet still her eye sparkled, and still her cheek glowed,       As onward so fleetly and bravely she rode.
         Thus over Thuringia sped she away,       With the speed of the hawk when he darts on his prey,--       Or an arrow let loose from a warrior's bow,       When it speeds with sure aim to the heart of his foe.
         Then the Hartz, the wild Hartz--the terrific--the proud!       Where the mist-spirit dwells in his palace of cloud!       Where the evil ones gather in envious wrath,       To blight and to blast,--towered up in her path.
         Still her cheek kept its glow, still her eye flashed in pride,       As onward she flew up the steep mountain side;       And fierce as the tempest, and fleet as the wind,       Stern Bohdo, the ruthless, still followed behind.
         To a fearful abyss, whose unhallowed name(3)       By the powers of darkness was given, she came,       And the whirlpool's wild voice, from the dark gulf below,       Came up like the wail of a soul in its we.
         Beyond rose the rocky shelf, barren and bare,       Beneath lay the whirlpool, around her despair,       Behind her came one, sweeping on in the chase,       Whose grasp was more dreaded than death's cold embrace.
         Then she called on the spirits who watch round the brave,       In peril to nerve, to assist and to save,       Closed calmly her eyes, as one sinking in sleep,       And urged her proud steed to the terrible leap!         A moment it paused on the high precipice,       Then sprang, boldly sprang, o'er the frightful abyss!       And struck its firm hoof in the rock till the sound       Shook the hills, and the sparks flew like lightning around!         And the foot-print it left has remained to this day,       And no rain-flood or tempest shall wear it away;       She was saved--the brave Emma was saved--but her crown,       From her fair brow unloosed, in the whirlpool sank down.
         On, on came the chief, in his fierceness and wrath,       Nor saw he the wide gulf that yawned in his path,--       And soon, in the depths of its fathomless tide,       The warrior and war-steed were laid side by side.
         And the mountaineer tells how in sullen despair,       His ghost, imannealed of its sins, lingers there;       Ever watching, pale, silent, untiring, unmoved,       The bright golden crown of the maiden he loved.
         A diver once, lured by the wealth of the prize,       Sought out the deep cave where it lay, and still lies,       And where, chained by a spirit-breathed spell, it shall stay,       Till the whirlpool and mountain alike pass away.
         Twice he rose with the crown, till its gleaming points blazed       On the eyes of the wondering thousands who gazed,       Twice it fell from his grasp, and sank quickly again       To the bed where for years undisturbed it had lain.
         He followed,--this effort the treasure may earn--       But vainly they watch who await his return;       A red hue of blood tinged the deep waters o'er,       But the diver came up from their dark depths no more.

 Bohdo.
 This hero, as his character is drawn in the original legend,  or tradition, from which the material of these verses was taken (a  tradition which gives the popular account of the formation of an immense  mark or cavity in a rock, called the "Rosstrappe" or "Horse's  footstep,") is worthy of being enrolled among Odin's Berserker.
    2.
 Nimrod.
 "A mighty hunter before the Lord.
" He built Babylon and  founded that royal line which terminated with the death of Sardanapalus;  whose gentleness and aversion to blood spilling, together with his  passion for his "Ionian Myrrha," cost him an empire, and gained him an  immortality.
    3.
 "It was named," says the tradition, "The Devil's dancing-place, from  the triumph there of the spirits of hell.

         Produced by Jim Tinsley                    Piccadilly Jim      by    Pelham Grenville Wodehouse                A RED-HAIRED GIRL    The residence of Mr. Peter Pett, the well-known financier, on  Riverside Drive is one of the leading eyesores of that breezy and  expensive boulevard.
 As you pass by in your limousine, or while  enjoying ten cents worth of fresh air on top of a green omnibus,  it jumps out and bites at you.
 Architects, confronted with it,  reel and throw up their hands defensively, and even the lay  observer has a sense of shock.
 The place resembles in almost  equal proportions a cathedral, a suburban villa, a hotel and a  Chinese pagoda.
 Many of its windows are of stained glass, and  above the porch stand two terra-cotta lions, considerably more  repulsive even than the complacent animals which guard New York's  Public Library.
 It is a house which is impossible to overlook:  and it was probably for this reason that Mrs. Pett insisted on  her husband buying it, for she was a woman who liked to be  noticed.
    Through the rich interior of this mansion Mr. Pett, its nominal  proprietor, was wandering like a lost spirit.
 The hour was about  ten of a fine Sunday morning, but the Sabbath calm which was upon  the house had not communicated itself to him.
 There was a look of  exasperation on his usually patient face, and a muttered oath,  picked up no doubt on the godless Stock Exchange, escaped his  lips.
    "Darn it!"    He was afflicted by a sense of the pathos of his position.
 It was  not as if he demanded much from life.
 He asked but little here  below.
 At that moment all that he wanted was a quiet spot where  he might read his Sunday paper in solitary peace, and he could  not find one.
 Intruders lurked behind every door.
 The place was  congested.
    This sort of thing had been growing worse and worse ever since  his marriage two years previously.
 There was a strong literary  virus in Mrs. Pett's system.
 She not only wrote voluminously  herself--the name Nesta Ford Pett is familiar to all lovers of  sensational fiction--but aimed at maintaining a salon.
 Starting,  in pursuance of this aim, with a single specimen,--her nephew,  Willie Partridge, who was working on a new explosive which would  eventually revolutionise war--she had gradually added to her  collections, until now she gave shelter beneath her terra-cotta  roof to no fewer than six young and unrecognised geniuses.
 Six  brilliant youths, mostly novelists who had not yet started and  poets who were about to begin, cluttered up Mr. Pett's rooms on  this fair June morning, while he, clutching his Sunday paper,  wandered about, finding, like the dove in Genesis, no rest.
 It  was at such times that he was almost inclined to envy his wife's  first husband, a business friend of his named Elmer Ford, who had  perished suddenly of an apoplectic seizure: and the pity which he  generally felt for the deceased tended to shift its focus.
    Marriage had certainly complicated life for Mr. Pett, as it  frequently does for the man who waits fifty years before trying  it.
 In addition to the geniuses, Mrs. Pett had brought with her  to her new home her only son, Ogden, a fourteen-year-old boy of a  singularly unloveable type.
 Years of grown-up society and the  absence of anything approaching discipline had given him a  precocity on which the earnest efforts of a series of private  tutors had expended themselves in vain.
 They came, full of  optimism and self-confidence, to retire after a brief interval,  shattered by the boy's stodgy resistance to education in any form  or shape.
 To Mr. Pett, never at his ease with boys, Ogden Ford  was a constant irritant.
 He disliked his stepson's personality,  and he more than suspected him of stealing his cigarettes.
 It  was an additional annoyance that he was fully aware of the  impossibility of ever catching him at it.
    Mr. Pett resumed his journey.
 He had interrupted it for a moment  to listen at the door of the morning-room, but, a remark in a  high tenor voice about the essential Christianity of the poet  Shelley filtering through the oak, he had moved on.
    Silence from behind another door farther down the passage  encouraged him to place his fingers on the handle, but a crashing  chord from an unseen piano made him remove them swiftly.
 He  roamed on, and a few minutes later the process of elimination had  brought him to what was technically his own private library--a  large, soothing room full of old books, of which his father had  been a great collector.
 Mr. Pett did not read old books himself,  but he liked to be among them, and it is proof of his pessimism  that he had not tried the library first.
 To his depressed mind it  had seemed hardly possible that there could be nobody there.
    He stood outside the door, listening tensely.
 He could hear  nothing.
 He went in, and for an instant experienced that ecstatic  thrill which only comes to elderly gentlemen of solitary habit  who in a house full of their juniors find themselves alone at  last.
 Then a voice spoke, shattering his dream of solitude.
    "Hello, pop!"    Ogden Ford was sprawling in a deep chair in the shadows.
    "Come in, pop, come in.
 Lots of room.
"    Mr. Pett stood in the doorway, regarding his step-son with a  sombre eye.
 He resented the boy's tone of easy patronage, all the  harder to endure with philosophic calm at the present moment from  the fact that the latter was lounging in his favourite chair.
  Even from an aesthetic point of view the sight of the bulging  child offended him.
 Ogden Ford was round and blobby and looked  overfed.
 He had the plethoric habit of one to whom wholesome  exercise is a stranger and the sallow complexion of the confirmed  candy-fiend.
 Even now, a bare half hour after breakfast, his jaws  were moving with a rhythmical, champing motion.
    "What are you eating, boy?" demanded Mr. Pett, his disappointment  turning to irritability.
    "Candy.
"    "I wish you would not eat candy all day.
"    "Mother gave it to me," said Ogden simply.
 As he had anticipated,  the shot silenced the enemy's battery.
 Mr. Pett grunted, but made  no verbal comment.
 Ogden celebrated his victory by putting  another piece of candy in his mouth.
    "Got a grouch this morning, haven't you, pop?"    "I will not be spoken to like that!"    "I thought you had," said his step-son complacently.
 "I can  always tell.
 I don't see why you want to come picking on me,  though.
 I've done nothing.
"    Mr. Pett was sniffing suspiciously.
    "You've been smoking.
"    "Me!!"    "Smoking cigarettes.
"    "No, sir!"    "There are two butts in the ash-tray.
"    "I didn't put them there.
"    "One of them is warm.
"    "It's a warm day.
"    "You dropped it there when you heard me come in.
"    "No, sir! I've only been here a few minutes.
 I guess one of the  fellows was in here before me.
 They're always swiping your  coffin-nails.
 You ought to do something about it, pop.
 You ought  to assert yourself.
"    A sense of helplessness came upon Mr. Pett.
 For the thousandth  time he felt himself baffled by this calm, goggle-eyed boy who  treated him with such supercilious coolness.
    "You ought to be out in the open air this lovely morning," he  said feebly.
    "All right.
 Let's go for a walk.
 I will if you will.
"    "I--I have other things to do," said Mr. Pett, recoiling from the  prospect.
    "Well, this fresh-air stuff is overrated anyway.
 Where's the  sense of having a home if you don't stop in it?"    "When I was your age, I would have been out on a morning like  this--er--bowling my hoop.
"    "And look at you now!"    "What do you mean?"    "Martyr to lumbago.
"    "I am not a martyr to lumbago," said Mr. Pett, who was touchy on  the subject.
    "Have it your own way.
 All I know is--"    "Never mind!"    "I'm only saying what mother .
 .
 .
"    "Be quiet!"    Ogden made further researches in the candy box.
    "Have some, pop?"    "No.
"    "Quite right.
 Got to be careful at your age.
"    "What do you mean?"    "Getting on, you know.
 Not so young as you used to be.
 Come in,  pop, if you're coming in.
 There's a draft from that door.
"    Mr. Pett retired, fermenting.
 He wondered how another man would  have handled this situation.
 The ridiculous inconsistency of the  human character infuriated him.
 Why should he be a totally  different man on Riverside Drive from the person he was in Pine  Street? Why should he be able to hold his own in Pine Street with  grown men--whiskered, square-jawed financiers--and yet be unable  on Riverside Drive to eject a fourteen-year-old boy from an easy  chair? It seemed to him sometimes that a curious paralysis of the  will came over him out of business hours.
    Meanwhile, he had still to find a place where he could read his  Sunday paper.
    He stood for a while in thought.
 Then his brow cleared, and he  began to mount the stairs.
 Reaching the top floor, he walked  along the passage and knocked on a door at the end of it.
 From  behind this door, as from behind those below, sounds proceeded,  but this time they did not seem to discourage Mr. Pett.
 It was  the tapping of a typewriter that he heard, and he listened to it  with an air of benevolent approval.
 He loved to hear the sound of  a typewriter: it made home so like the office.
    "Come in," called a girl's voice.
    The room in which Mr. Pett found himself was small but cosy, and  its cosiness--oddly, considering the sex of its owner--had that  peculiar quality which belongs as a rule to the dens of men.
 A  large bookcase almost covered one side of it, its reds and blues  and browns smiling cheerfully at whoever entered.
 The walls were  hung with prints, judiciously chosen and arranged.
 Through a  window to the left, healthfully open at the bottom, the sun  streamed in, bringing with it the pleasantly subdued whirring of  automobiles out on the Drive.
 At a desk at right angles to this  window, her vivid red-gold hair rippling in the breeze from the  river, sat the girl who had been working at the typewriter.
 She  turned as Mr. Pett entered, and smiled over her shoulder.
    Ann Chester, Mr. Pett's niece, looked her best when she smiled.
  Although her hair was the most obviously striking feature of her  appearance, her mouth was really the most individual thing about  her.
 It was a mouth that suggested adventurous possibilities.
 In  repose, it had a look of having just finished saying something  humorous, a kind of demure appreciation of itself.
 When it  smiled, a row of white teeth flashed out: or, if the lips did not  part, a dimple appeared on the right cheek, giving the whole face  an air of mischievous geniality.
 It was an enterprising,  swashbuckling sort of mouth, the mouth of one who would lead  forlorn hopes with a jest or plot whimsically lawless  conspiracies against convention.
 In its corners and in the firm  line of the chin beneath it there lurked, too, more than a hint  of imperiousness.
 A physiognomist would have gathered, correctly,  that Ann Chester liked having her own way and was accustomed to  get it.
    "Hello, uncle Peter," she said.
 "What's the trouble?"    "Am I interrupting you, Ann?"    "Not a bit.
 I'm only copying out a story for aunt Nesta.
 I  promised her I would.
 Would you like to hear some of it?"    Mr. Pett said he would not.
    "You're missing a good thing," said Ann, turning the pages.
 "I'm  all worked up over it.
 It's called 'At Dead of Night,' and it's  full of crime and everything.
 You would never think aunt Nesta  had such a feverish imagination.
 There are detectives and  kidnappers in it and all sorts of luxuries.
 I suppose it's the  effect of reading it, but you look to me as if you were trailing  something.
 You've got a sort of purposeful air.
"    Mr. Pett's amiable face writhed into what was intended to be a  bitter smile.
    "I'm only trailing a quiet place to read in.
 I never saw such a  place as this house.
 It looks big enough outside for a regiment.
  Yet, when you're inside, there's a poet or something in every  room.
"    "What about the library? Isn't that sacred to you?"    "The boy Ogden's there.
"    "What a shame!"    "Wallowing in my best chair," said Mr. Pett morosely.
 "Smoking  cigarettes.
"    "Smoking? I thought he had promised aunt Nesta he wouldn't smoke.
"    "Well, he said he wasn't, of course, but I know he had been.
 I  don't know what to do with that boy.
 It's no good my talking to  him.
 He--he patronises me!" concluded Mr. Pett indignantly.
  "Sits there on his shoulder blades with his feet on the table  and talks to me with his mouth full of candy as if I were his  grandson.
"    "Little brute.
"    Ann was sorry for Mr. Pett.
 For many years now, ever since the  death of her mother, they had been inseparable.
 Her father, who  was a traveller, explorer, big-game hunter, and general sojourner  in the lonelier and wilder spots of the world and paid only  infrequent visits to New York, had left her almost entirely in  Mr. Pett's care, and all her pleasantest memories were associated  with him.
 Mr. Chester's was in many ways an admirable character,  but not a domestic one; and his relations with his daughter were  confined for the most part to letters and presents.
 In the past  few years she had come almost to regard Mr. Pett in the light of  a father.
 Hers was a nature swiftly responsive to kindness; and  because Mr. Pett besides being kind was also pathetic she pitied  as well as loved him.
 There was a lingering boyishness in the  financier, the boyishness of the boy who muddles along in an  unsympathetic world and can never do anything right: and this  quality called aloud to the youth in her.
 She was at the valiant  age when we burn to right wrongs and succour the oppressed, and  wild rebel schemes for the reformation of her small world came  readily to her.
 From the first she had been a smouldering  spectator of the trials of her uncle's married life, and if Mr.  Pett had ever asked her advice and bound himself to act on it he  would have solved his domestic troubles in explosive fashion.
 For  Ann in her moments of maiden meditation had frequently devised  schemes to that end which would have made his grey hair stand  erect with horror.
    "I've seen a good many boys," she said, "but Ogden is in a class  by himself.
 He ought to be sent to a strict boarding-school, of  course.
"    "He ought to be sent to Sing-Sing," amended Mr. Pett.
    "Why don't you send him to school?"    "Your aunt wouldn't hear of it.
 She's afraid of his being  kidnapped.
 It happened last time he went to school.
 You can't  blame her for wanting to keep her eye on him after that.
"    Ann ran her fingers meditatively over the keys.
    "I've sometimes thought .
 .
 .
"    "Yes?"    "Oh, nothing.
 I must get on with this thing for aunt Nesta.
"    Mr. Pett placed the bulk of the Sunday paper on the floor beside  him, and began to run an appreciative eye over the comic  supplement.
 That lingering boyishness in him which endeared him  to Ann always led him to open his Sabbath reading in this  fashion.
 Grey-headed though he was, he still retained both in art  and in real life a taste for the slapstick.
 No one had ever known  the pure pleasure it had given him when Raymond Green, his wife's  novelist protege, had tripped over a loose stair-rod one morning  and fallen an entire flight.
    From some point farther down the corridor came a muffled  thudding.
 Ann stopped her work to listen.
    "There's Jerry Mitchell punching the bag.
"    "Eh?" said Mr. Pett.
    "I only said I could hear Jerry Mitchell in the gymnasium.
"    "Yes, he's there.
"    Ann looked out of the window thoughtfully for a moment.
 Then she  swung round in her swivel-chair.
    "Uncle Peter.
"    Mr. Pett emerged slowly from the comic supplement.
    "Eh?"    "Did Jerry Mitchell ever tell you about that friend of his who  keeps a dogs' hospital down on Long Island somewhere? I forget  his name.
 Smithers or Smethurst or something.
 People--old ladies,  you know, and people--bring him their dogs to be cured when they  get sick.
 He has an infallible remedy, Jerry tells me.
 He makes a  lot of money at it.
"    "Money?" Pett, the student, became Pett, the financier, at the  magic word.
 "There might be something in that if one got behind  it.
 Dogs are fashionable.
 There would be a market for a really  good medicine.
"    "I'm afraid you couldn't put Mr. Smethurst's remedy on the  market.
 It only works when the dog has been overeating himself  and not taking any exercise.
"    "Well, that's all these fancy dogs ever have the matter with  them.
 It looks to me as if I might do business with this man.
  I'll get his address from Mitchell.
"    "It's no use thinking of it, uncle Peter.
 You couldn't do  business with him--in that way.
 All Mr. Smethurst does when any  one brings him a fat, unhealthy dog is to feed it next to  nothing--just the simplest kind of food, you know--and make it  run about a lot.
 And in about a week the dog's as well and happy  and nice as he can possibly be.
"    "Oh," said Mr. Pett, disappointed.
    Ann touched the keys of her machine softly.
    "Why I mentioned Mr. Smethurst," she said, "it was because we had  been talking of Ogden.
 Don't you think his treatment would be  just what Ogden needs?"    Mr. Pett's eyes gleamed.
    "It's a shame he can't have a week or two of it!"    Ann played a little tune with her finger-tips on the desk.
    "It would do him good, wouldn't it?"    Silence fell upon the room, broken only by the tapping of the  typewriter.
 Mr. Pett, having finished the comic supplement,  turned to the sporting section, for he was a baseball fan of no  lukewarm order.
 The claims of business did not permit him to see  as many games as he could wish, but he followed the national  pastime closely on the printed page and had an admiration for the  Napoleonic gifts of Mr. McGraw which would have gratified that  gentleman had he known of it.
    "Uncle Peter," said Ann, turning round again.
    "Eh?"    "It's funny you should have been talking about Ogden getting  kidnapped.
 This story of aunt Nesta's is all about an  angel-child--I suppose it's meant to be Ogden--being stolen and  hidden and all that.
 It's odd that she should write stories like  this.
 You wouldn't expect it of her.
"    "Your aunt," said Mr. Pett, "lets her mind run on that sort of  thing a good deal.
 She tells me there was a time, not so long  ago, when half the kidnappers in America were after him.
 She sent  him to school in England--or, rather, her husband did.
 They were  separated then--and, as far as I can follow the story, they all  took the next boat and besieged the place.
"    "It's a pity somebody doesn't smuggle him away now and keep him  till he's a better boy.
"    "Ah!" said Mr. Pett wistfully.
    Ann looked at him fixedly, but his eyes were once more on his  paper.
 She gave a little sigh, and turned to her work again.
    "It's quite demoralising, typing aunt Nesta's stories," she said.
  "They put ideas into one's head.
"    Mr. Pett said nothing.
 He was reading an article of medical  interest in the magazine section, for he was a man who ploughed  steadily through his Sunday paper, omitting nothing.
 The  typewriter began tapping again.
    "Great Godfrey!"    Ann swung round, and gazed at her uncle in concern.
 He was  staring blankly at the paper.
    "What's the matter?"    The page on which Mr. Pett's attention was concentrated was  decorated with a fanciful picture in bold lines of a young man in  evening dress pursuing a young woman similarly clad along what  appeared to be a restaurant supper-table.
 An enjoyable time was  apparently being had by both.
 Across the page this legend ran:                PICCADILLY JIM ONCE MORE                The Recent Adventures of Young Mr. Crocker                of New York and London    It was not upon the title, however, nor upon the illustration  that Mr. Pett's fascinated eye rested.
 What he was looking at was  a small reproduction of a photograph which had been inserted in  the body of the article.
 It was the photograph of a woman in the  early forties, rather formidably handsome, beneath which were  printed the words:                Mrs. Nesta Ford Pett                Well-Known Society Leader and Authoress    Ann had risen and was peering over his shoulder.
 She frowned as  she caught sight of the heading of the page.
 Then her eye fell  upon the photograph.
    "Good gracious! Why have they got aunt Nesta's picture there?"    Mr. Pett breathed a deep and gloomy breath.
    "They've found out she's his aunt.
 I was afraid they would.
 I  don't know what she will say when she sees this.
"    "Don't let her see it.
"    "She has the paper downstairs.
 She's probably reading it now.
"    Ann was glancing through the article.
    "It seems to be much the same sort of thing that they have  published before.
 I can't understand why the _Chronicle_ takes such  an interest in Jimmy Crocker.
"    "Well, you see he used to be a newspaper man, and the _Chronicle_  was the paper he worked for.
"    Ann flushed.
    "I know," she said shortly.
    Something in her tone arrested Mr. Pett's attention.
    "Yes, yes, of course," he said hastily.
 "I was forgetting.
"    There was an awkward silence.
 Mr. Pett coughed.
 The matter of  young Mr. Crocker's erstwhile connection with the New York  _Chronicle_ was one which they had tacitly decided to refrain from  mentioning.
    "I didn't know he was your nephew, uncle Peter.
"    "Nephew by marriage," corrected Mr. Pett a little hurriedly.
  "Nesta's sister Eugenia married his father.
"    "I suppose that makes me a sort of cousin.
"    "A distant cousin.
"    "It can't be too distant for me.
"    There was a sound of hurried footsteps outside the door.
 Mrs.  Pett entered, holding a paper in her hand.
 She waved it before  Mr. Pett's sympathetic face.
    "I know, my dear," he said backing.
 "Ann and I were just talking  about it.
"    The little photograph had not done Mrs. Pett justice.
 Seen  life-size, she was both handsomer and more formidable than she  appeared in reproduction.
 She was a large woman, with a fine  figure and bold and compelling eyes, and her personality crashed  disturbingly into the quiet atmosphere of the room.
 She was the  type of woman whom small, diffident men seem to marry  instinctively, as unable to help themselves as cockleshell boats  sucked into a maelstrom.
    "What are you going to do about it?" she demanded, sinking  heavily into the chair which her husband had vacated.
    This was an aspect of the matter which had not occurred to Mr.  Pett.
 He had not contemplated the possibility of actually doing  anything.
 Nature had made him out of office hours essentially a  passive organism, and it was his tendency, when he found himself  in a sea of troubles, to float plaintively, not to take arms  against it.
 To pick up the slings and arrows of outrageous  fortune and fling them back was not a habit of his.
 He scratched  his chin and said nothing.
 He went on saying nothing.
    "If Eugenia had had any sense, she would have foreseen what would  happen if she took the boy away from New York where he was  working too hard to get into mischief and let him run loose in  London with too much money and nothing to do.
 But, if she had had  any sense, she would never have married that impossible Crocker  man.
 As I told her.
"    Mrs. Pett paused, and her eyes glowed with reminiscent fire.
 She  was recalling the scene which had taken place three years ago  between her sister and herself, when Eugenia had told her of her  intention to marry an obscure and middle-aged actor named Bingley  Crocker.
 Mrs. Pett had never seen Bingley Crocker, but she had  condemned the proposed match in terms which had ended definitely  and forever her relations with her sister.
 Eugenia was not a  woman who welcomed criticism of her actions.
 She was cast in the  same formidable mould as Mrs. Pett and resembled her strikingly  both in appearance and character.
    Mrs. Pett returned to the present.
 The past could look after  itself.
 The present demanded surgery.
    "One would have thought it would have been obvious even to  Eugenia that a boy of twenty-one needed regular work.
"    Mr. Pett was glad to come out of his shell here.
 He was the  Apostle of Work, and this sentiment pleased him.
    "That's right," he said.
 "Every boy ought to have work.
"    "Look at this young Crocker's record since he went to live in  London.
 He is always doing something to make himself notorious.
  There was that breach-of-promise case, and that fight at the  political meeting, and his escapades at Monte Carlo, and--and  everything.
 And he must be drinking himself to death.
 I think  Eugenia's insane.
 She seems to have no influence over him at  all.
"    Mr. Pett moaned sympathetically.
    "And now the papers have found out that I am his aunt, and I  suppose they will print my photograph whenever they publish an  article about him.
"    She ceased and sat rigid with just wrath.
 Mr. Pett, who always  felt his responsibilities as chorus keenly during these wifely  monologues, surmised that a remark from him was indicated.
    "It's tough," he said.
    Mrs. Pett turned on him like a wounded tigress.
    "What is the use of saying that? It's no use saying anything.
"    "No, no," said Mr. Pett, prudently refraining from pointing out  that she had already said a good deal.
    "You must do something.
"    Ann entered the conversation for the first time.
 She was not very  fond of her aunt, and liked her least when she was bullying Mr.  Pett.
 There was something in Mrs. Pett's character with which the  imperiousness which lay beneath Ann's cheerful attitude towards  the world was ever at war.
    "What can uncle Peter possibly do?" she inquired.
    "Why, get the boy back to America and make him work.
 It's the  only possible thing.
"    "But is it possible?"    "Of course it is.
"    "Assuming that Jimmy Crocker would accept an invitation to come  over to America, what sort of work could he do here? He couldn't  get his place on the _Chronicle_ back again after dropping out for  all these years and making a public pest of himself all that  while.
 And outside of newspaper work what is he fit for?"    "My dear child, don't make difficulties.
"    "I'm not.
 These are ready-made.
"    Mr. Pett interposed.
 He was always nervously apprehensive of a  clash between these two.
 Ann had red hair and the nature which  generally goes with red hair.
 She was impulsive and quick of  tongue, and--as he remembered her father had always been--a  little too ready for combat.
 She was usually as quickly  remorseful as she was quickly pugnacious, like most persons of  her colour.
 Her offer to type the story which now lay on her desk  had been the amende honourable following on just such a scene  with her aunt as this promised to be.
 Mr. Pett had no wish to see  the truce thus consummated broken almost before it had had time  to operate.
    "I could give the boy a job in my office," he suggested.
    Giving young men jobs in his office was what Mr. Pett liked doing  best.
 There were six brilliant youths living in his house and  bursting with his food at that very moment whom he would have  been delighted to start addressing envelopes down-town.
    Notably his wife's nephew, Willie Partridge, whom he looked on as  a specious loafer.
 He had a stubborn disbelief in the explosive  that was to revolutionise war.
 He knew, as all the world did,  that Willie's late father had been a great inventor, but he did  not accept the fact that Willie had inherited the dead man's  genius.
 He regarded the experiments on Partridgite, as it was to  be called, with the profoundest scepticism, and considered that  the only thing Willie had ever invented or was likely to invent  was a series of ingenious schemes for living in fatted idleness  on other people's money.
    "Exactly," said Mrs. Pett, delighted at the suggestion.
 "The very  thing.
"    "Will you write and suggest it?" said Mr. Pett, basking in the  sunshine of unwonted commendation.
    "What would be the use of writing? Eugenia would pay no  attention.
 Besides, I could not say all I wished to in a letter.
  No, the only thing is to go over to England and see her.
 I shall  speak very plainly to her.
 I shall point out what an advantage it  will be to the boy to be in your office and to live here.
 .
 .
 .
"    Ann started.
    "You don't mean live here--in this house?"    "Of course.
 There would be no sense in bringing the boy all the  way over from England if he was to be allowed to run loose when  he got here.
"    Mr. Pett coughed deprecatingly.
    "I don't think that would be very pleasant for Ann, dear.
"    "Why in the name of goodness should Ann object?"    Ann moved towards the door.
    "Thank you for thinking of it, uncle Peter.
 You're always a dear.
  But don't worry about me.
 Do just as you want to.
 In any case I'm  quite certain that you won't be able to get him to come over  here.
 You can see by the paper he's having far too good a time in  London.
 You can call Jimmy Crockers from the vasty deep, but will  they come when you call for them?"    Mrs. Pett looked at the door as it closed behind her, then at her  husband.
    "What do you mean, Peter, about Ann? Why wouldn't it be pleasant  for her if this Crocker boy came to live with us?"    Mr. Pett hesitated.
    "Well, it's like this, Nesta.
 I hope you won't tell her I told  you.
 She's sensitive about it, poor girl.
 It all happened before  you and I were married.
 Ann was much younger then.
 You know what  schoolgirls are, kind of foolish and sentimental.
 It was my fault  really, I ought to have .
 .
 .
"    "Good Heavens, Peter! What are you trying to tell me?"    "She was only a child.
"    Mrs. Pett rose in slow horror.
    "Peter! Tell me! Don't try to break it gently.
"    "Ann wrote a book of poetry and I had it published for her.
"    Mrs. Pett sank back in her chair.
    "Oh!" she said--it would have been hard to say whether with  relief or disappointment.
 "Whatever did you make such a fuss for?  Why did you want to be so mysterious?"    "It was all my fault, really," proceeded Mr. Pett.
 "I ought to  have known better.
 All I thought of at the time was that it would  please the child to see the poems in print and be able to give  the book to her friends.
 She did give it to her friends," he went  on ruefully, "and ever since she's been trying to live it down.
  I've seen her bite a young fellow's head off when he tried to  make a grand-stand play with her by quoting her poems which he'd  found in his sister's book-shelf.
"    "But, in the name of goodness, what has all this to do with young  Crocker?"    "Why, it was this way.
 Most of the papers just gave Ann's book a  mention among 'Volumes Received,' or a couple of lines that  didn't amount to anything, but the _Chronicle_ saw a Sunday feature  in it, as Ann was going about a lot then and was a well-known  society girl.
 They sent this Crocker boy to get an interview from  her, all about her methods of work and inspirations and what not.
  We never suspected it wasn't the straight goods.
 Why, that very  evening I mailed an order for a hundred copies to be sent to me  when the thing appeared.
 And--" pinkness came upon Mr. Pett at  the recollection "it was just a josh from start to finish.
 The  young hound made a joke of the poems and what Ann had told him  about her inspirations and quoted bits of the poems just to kid  the life out of them.
 .
 .
 .
 I thought Ann would never get over  it.
 Well, it doesn't worry her any more--she's grown out of the  school-girl stage--but you can bet she isn't going to get up and  give three cheers and a tiger if you bring young Crocker to live  in the same house.
"    "Utterly ridiculous!" said Mrs. Pett.
 "I certainly do not intend  to alter my plans because of a trivial incident that happened  years ago.
 We will sail on Wednesday.
"    "Very well, my dear," said Mr. Pett resignedly.
    "Just as you say.
 Er--just you and I?"    "And Ogden, of course.
"    Mr. Pett controlled a facial spasm with a powerful effort of the  will.
 He had feared this.
    "I wouldn't dream of leaving him here while I went away, after  what happened when poor dear Elmer sent him to school in England  that time.
" The late Mr. Ford had spent most of his married life  either quarrelling with or separated from his wife, but since  death he had been canonised as 'poor dear Elmer.
' "Besides, the  sea voyage will do the poor darling good.
 He has not been looking  at all well lately.
"    "If Ogden's coming, I'd like to take Ann.
"    "Why?"    "She can--" he sought for a euphemism.
    "Keep in order" was the expression he wished to avoid.
 To his  mind Ann was the only known antidote for Ogden, but he felt it  would be impolitic to say so.
"--look after him on the boat," he  concluded.
 "You know you are a bad sailor.
"    "Very well.
 Bring Ann--Oh, Peter, that reminds me of what I  wanted to say to you, which this dreadful thing in the paper  drove completely out of my mind.
 Lord Wisbeach has asked Ann to  marry him!"    Mr. Pett looked a little hurt.
 "She didn't tell me.
" Ann usually  confided in him.
    "She didn't tell me, either.
 Lord Wisbeach told me.
 He said Ann  had promised to think it over, and give him his answer later.
  Meanwhile, he had come to me to assure himself that I approved.
 I  thought that so charming of him.
"    Mr. Pett was frowning.
    "She hasn't accepted him?"    "Not definitely.
"    "I hope she doesn't.
"    "Don't be foolish, Peter.
 It would be an excellent match.
"    Mr. Pett shuffled his feet.
    "I don't like him.
 There's something too darned smooth about that  fellow.
"    "If you mean that his manners are perfect, I agree with you.
 I  shall do all in my power to induce Ann to accept him.
"    "I shouldn't," said Mr. Pett, with more decision than was his  wont.
 "You know what Ann is if you try to force her to do  anything.
 She gets her ears back and won't budge.
 Her father is  just the same.
 When we were boys together, sometimes--"    "Don't be absurd, Peter.
 As if I should dream of trying to force  Ann to do anything.
"    "We don't know anything of this fellow.
 Two weeks ago we didn't  know he was on the earth.
"    "What do we need to know beyond his name?"    Mr. Pett said nothing, but he was not convinced.
 The Lord  Wisbeach under discussion was a pleasant-spoken and presentable  young man who had called at Mr. Pett's office a short while  before to consult him about investing some money.
 He had brought  a letter of introduction from Hammond Chester, Ann's father, whom  he had met in Canada, where the latter was at present engaged in  the comparatively mild occupation of bass-fishing.
 With their  business talk the acquaintance would have begun and finished, if  Mr. Pett had been able to please himself, for he had not taken a  fancy to Lord Wisbeach.
 But he was an American, with an  American's sense of hospitality, and, the young man being a  friend of Hammond Chester, he had felt bound to invite him to  Riverside Drive--with misgivings which were now, he felt,  completely justified.
    "Ann ought to marry," said Mrs. Pett.
 "She gets her own way too  much now.
 However, it is entirely her own affair, and there is  nothing that we can do.
" She rose.
 "I only hope she will be  sensible.
"    She went out, leaving Mr. Pett gloomier than she had found him.
  He hated the idea of Ann marrying Lord Wisbeach, who, even if he  had had no faults at all, would be objectionable in that he would  probably take her to live three thousand miles away in his own  country.
 The thought of losing Ann oppressed Mr. Pett sorely.
    Ann, meanwhile, had made her way down the passage to the gymnasium  which Mr. Pett, in the interests of his health, had caused to be  constructed in a large room at the end of the house--a room designed  by the original owner, who had had artistic leanings, for a studio.
  The _tap-tap-tap_ of the leather bag had ceased, but voices from  within told her that Jerry Mitchell, Mr. Pett's private physical  instructor, was still there.
 She wondered who was his companion, and  found on opening the door that it was Ogden.
 The boy was leaning  against the wall and regarding Jerry with a dull and supercilious  gaze which the latter was plainly finding it hard to bear.
    "Yes, sir!" Ogden was saying, as Ann entered.
 "I heard Biggs  asking her to come for a joyride.
"    "I bet she turned him down," said Jerry Mitchell sullenly.
    "I bet she didn't.
 Why should she? Biggs is an awful good-looking  fellow.
"    "What are you talking about, Ogden?" said Ann.
    "I was telling him that Biggs asked Celestine to go for a ride in  the car with him.
"    "I'll knock his block off," muttered the incensed Jerry.
    Ogden laughed derisively.
    "Yes, you will! Mother would fire you if you touched him.
 She  wouldn't stand for having her chauffeur beaten up.
"    Jerry Mitchell turned an appealing face to Ann.
 Ogden's  revelations and especially his eulogy of Biggs' personal  appearance had tormented him.
 He knew that, in his wooing of Mrs.  Pett's maid, Celestine, he was handicapped by his looks,  concerning which he had no illusions.
 No Adonis to begin with, he  had been so edited and re-edited during a long and prosperous  ring career by the gloved fists of a hundred foes that in affairs  of the heart he was obliged to rely exclusively on moral worth  and charm of manner.
 He belonged to the old school of fighters  who looked the part, and in these days of pugilists who resemble  matinee idols he had the appearance of an anachronism.
 He was a  stocky man with a round, solid head, small eyes, an undershot  jaw, and a nose which ill-treatment had reduced to a mere  scenario.
 A narrow strip of forehead acted as a kind of  buffer-state, separating his front hair from his eyebrows, and he  bore beyond hope of concealment the badge of his late employment,  the cauliflower ear.
 Yet was he a man of worth and a good  citizen, and Ann had liked him from their first meeting.
 As for  Jerry, he worshipped Ann and would have done anything she asked  him.
 Ever since he had discovered that Ann was willing to listen  to and sympathise with his outpourings on the subject of his  troubled wooing, he had been her slave.
    Ann came to the rescue in characteristically direct fashion.
    "Get out, Ogden," she said.
    Ogden tried to meet her eye mutinously, but failed.
 Why he should  be afraid of Ann he had never been able to understand, but it was  a fact that she was the only person of his acquaintance whom he  respected.
 She had a bright eye and a calm, imperious stare which  never failed to tame him.
    "Why?" he muttered.
 "You're not my boss.
"    "Be quick, Ogden.
"    "What's the big idea--ordering a fellow--"    "And close the door gently behind you," said Ann.
 She turned to  Jerry, as the order was obeyed.
    "Has he been bothering you, Jerry?"    Jerry Mitchell wiped his forehead.
    "Say, if that kid don't quit butting in when I'm working in the  gym--You heard what he was saying about Maggie, Miss Ann?"    Celestine had been born Maggie O'Toole, a name which Mrs. Pett  stoutly refused to countenance in any maid of hers.
    "Why on earth do you pay any attention to him, Jerry? You must  have seen that he was making it all up.
 He spends his whole time  wandering about till he finds some one he can torment, and then  he enjoys himself.
 Maggie would never dream of going out in the  car with Biggs.
"    Jerry Mitchell sighed a sigh of relief.
    "It's great for a fellow to have you in his corner, Miss Ann.
"    Ann went to the door and opened it.
 She looked down the passage,  then, satisfied as to its emptiness, returned to her seat.
    "Jerry, I want to talk to you.
 I have an idea.
 Something I want  you to do for me.
"    "Yes, Miss Ann?"    "We've got to do something about that child, Ogden.
 He's been  worrying uncle Peter again, and I'm not going to have it.
 I  warned him once that, if he did it again, awful things would  happen to him, but he didn't believe me.
 I suppose, Jerry--what  sort of a man is your friend, Mr. Smethurst?"    "Do you mean Smithers, Miss Ann?"    "I knew it was either Smithers or Smethurst.
 The dog man, I mean.
  Is he a man you can trust?"    "With my last buck.
 I've known him since we were kids.
"    "I don't mean as regards money.
 I am going to send Ogden to him  for treatment, and I want to know if I can rely on him to help  me.
"    "For the love of Mike.
"    Jerry Mitchell, after an instant of stunned bewilderment, was  looking at her with worshipping admiration.
 He had always known  that Miss Ann possessed a mind of no common order, but this, he  felt, was genius.
 For a moment the magnificence of the idea took  his breath away.
    "Do you mean that you're going to kidnap him, Miss Ann?"    "Yes.
 That is to say, _you_ are--if I can persuade you to do  it for me.
"    "Sneak him away and send him to Bud Smithers' dog-hospital?"    "For treatment.
 I like Mr. Smithers' methods.
 I think they would  do Ogden all the good in the world.
"    Jerry was enthusiastic.
    "Why, Bud would make him part-human.
 But, say, isn't it taking  big chances? Kidnapping's a penitentiary offence.
"    "This isn't that sort of kidnapping.
"    "Well, it's mighty like it.
"    "I don't think you need be afraid of the penitentiary.
 I can't  see aunt Nesta prosecuting, when it would mean that she would  have to charge us with having sent Ogden to a dogs' hospital.
 She  likes publicity, but it has to be the right kind of publicity.
  No, we do run a risk, but it isn't that one.
 You run the risk of  losing your job here, and I should certainly be sent to my  grandmother for an indefinite sentence.
 You've never seen my  grandmother, have you, Jerry? She's the only person in the world  I'm afraid of! She lives miles from anywhere and has family  prayers at seven-thirty sharp every morning.
 Well, I'm ready to  risk her, if you're ready to risk your job, in such a good cause.
  You know you're just as fond of uncle Peter as I am, and Ogden is  worrying him into a breakdown.
 Surely you won't refuse to help  me, Jerry?"    Jerry rose and extended a calloused hand.
    "When do we start?"    Ann shook the hand warmly.
    "Thank you, Jerry.
 You're a jewel.
 I envy Maggie.
 Well, I don't  think we can do anything till they come back from England, as  aunt Nesta is sure to take Ogden with her.
"    "Who's going to England?"    "Uncle Peter and aunt Nesta were talking just now of sailing to  try and persuade a young man named Crocker to come back here.
"    "Crocker? Jimmy Crocker? Piccadilly Jim?"    "Yes.
 Why, do you know him?"    "I used to meet him sometimes when he was working on the  _Chronicle_ here.
 Looks as if he was cutting a wide swathe in dear  old London.
 Did you see the paper to-day?"    "Yes, that's what made aunt Nesta want to bring him over.
 Of  course, there isn't the remotest chance that she will be able to  make him come.
 Why should he come?"    "Last time I saw Jimmy Crocker," said Jerry, "it was a couple of  years ago, when I went over to train Eddie Flynn for his go with  Porky Jones at the National.
 I bumped into him at the N.
 S.
 C.
 He  was a good deal tanked.
"    "He's always drinking, I believe.
"    "He took me to supper at some swell joint where they all had the  soup-and-fish on but me.
 I felt like a dirty deuce in a clean  deck.
 He used to be a regular fellow, Jimmy Crocker, but from  what you read in the papers it begins to look as if he was  hitting it up too swift.
 It's always the way with those boys when  you take them off a steady job and let them run around loose with  their jeans full of mazuma.
"    "That's exactly why I want to do something about Ogden.
 If he's  allowed to go on as he is at present, he will grow up exactly  like Jimmy Crocker.
"    "Aw, Jimmy Crocker ain't in Ogden's class," protested Jerry.
    "Yes, he is.
 There's absolutely no difference between them.
"    "Say! You've got it in for Jim, haven't you, Miss Ann?" Jerry  looked at her wonderingly.
 "What's your kick against him?"    Ann bit her lip.
 "I object to him on principle," she said.
 "I  don't like his type.
 .
 .
 .
 Well, I'm glad we've settled this  about Ogden, Jerry.
 I knew I could rely on you.
 But I won't let  you do it for nothing.
 Uncle Peter shall give you something for  it--enough to start that health-farm you talk about so much.
  Then you can marry Maggie and live happily ever afterwards.
"    "Gee! Is the boss in on this, too?"    "Not yet.
 I'm going to tell him now.
 Hush! There's some one  coming.
"    Mr. Pett wandered in.
 He was still looking troubled.
    "Oh, Ann--good morning, Mitchell--your aunt has decided to go to  England.
 I want you to come, too.
"    "You want me? To help interview Jimmy Crocker?"    "No, no.
 Just to come along and be company on the voyage.
 You'll  be such a help with Ogden, Ann.
 You can keep him in order.
 How  you do it, I don't know.
 You seem to make another boy of him.
"    Ann stole a glance at Jerry, who answered with an encouraging  grin.
 Ann was constrained to make her meaning plainer than by the  language of the eye.
    "Would you mind just running away for half a moment, Jerry?" she  said winningly.
 "I want to say something to uncle Peter.
"    "Sure.
 Sure.
"    Ann turned to Mr. Pett as the door closed.
    "You'd like somebody to make Ogden a different boy, wouldn't you,  uncle Peter?"    "I wish it was possible.
"    "He's been worrying you a lot lately, hasn't he?" asked Ann  sympathetically.
    "Yes," sighed Mr. Pett.
    "Then that's all right," said Ann briskly.
 "I was afraid that you  might not approve.
 But, if you do, I'll go right ahead.
"    Mr. Pett started violently.
 There was something in Ann's voice  and, as he looked at her, something in her face which made him  fear the worst.
 Her eyes were flashing with an inspired light of  a highly belligerent nature, and the sun turned the red hair to  which she owed her deplorable want of balance to a mass of flame.
  There was something in the air.
 Mr. Pett sensed it with every  nerve of his apprehensive person.
 He gazed at Ann, and as he did  so the years seemed to slip from him and he was a boy again,  about to be urged to lawless courses by the superior will of his  boyhood's hero, Hammond Chester.
 In the boyhood of nearly every  man there is a single outstanding figure, some one youthful  hypnotic Napoleon whose will was law and at whose bidding his  better judgment curled up and died.
 In Mr. Pett's life Ann's  father had filled this role.
 He had dominated Mr. Pett at an age  when the mind is most malleable.
 And now--so true is it that  though Time may blunt our boyish memories the traditions of  boyhood live on in us and an emotional crisis will bring them to  the surface as an explosion brings up the fish that lurk in the  nethermost mud--it was as if he were facing the youthful Hammond  Chester again and being irresistibly impelled to some course of  which he entirely disapproved but which he knew that he was  destined to undertake.
 He watched Ann as a trapped man might  watch a ticking bomb, bracing himself for the explosion and  knowing that he is helpless.
 She was Hammond Chester's daughter,  and she spoke to him with the voice of Hammond Chester.
 She was  her father's child and she was going to start something.
    "I've arranged it all with Jerry," said Ann.
 "He's going to help  me smuggle Ogden away to that friend of his I told you about who  keeps the dog-hospital: and the friend is going to keep him until  he reforms.
 Isn't it a perfectly splendid idea?"    Mr. Pett blanched.
 The frightfulness of reality had exceeded  anticipation.
    "But, Ann!"    The words came from him in a strangled bleat.
 His whole being was  paralysed by a clammy horror.
 This was beyond the uttermost limit  of his fears.
 And, to complete the terror of the moment, he knew,  even while he rebelled against the insane lawlessness of her  scheme, that he was going to agree to it, and--worst of all--that  deep, deep down in him there was a feeling toward it which did  not dare to come to the surface but which he knew to be approval.
    "Of course Jerry would do it for nothing," said Ann, "but I  promised him that you would give him something for his trouble.
  You can arrange all that yourselves later.
"    "But, Ann! .
 .
 .
 But, Ann! .
 .
 .
 Suppose your aunt finds out who  did it!"    "Well, there will be a tremendous row!" said Ann composedly.
  "And you will have to assert yourself.
 It will be a splendid  thing for you.
 You know you are much too kind to every one, uncle  Peter.
 I don't think there's any one who would put up with what  you do.
 Father told me in one of his letters that he used to call  you Patient Pete as a boy.
"    Mr. Pett started.
 Not for many a day had a nickname which he  considered the most distasteful of all possible nicknames risen  up from its grave to haunt him.
 Patient Pete! He had thought the  repulsive title buried forever in the same tomb as his dead  youth.
 Patient Pete! The first faint glimmer of the flame of  rebellion began to burn in his bosom.
    "Patient Pete!"    "Patient Pete!" said Ann inexorably.
    "But, Ann,"--there was pathos in Mr. Pett's voice--"I like a  peaceful life.
"    "You'll never have one if you don't stand up for yourself.
 You  know quite well that father is right.
 You do let every one  trample on you.
 Do you think father would let Ogden worry him and  have his house filled with affected imitation geniuses so that he  couldn't find a room to be alone in?"    "But, Ann, your father is different.
 He likes fusses.
 I've known  your father contradict a man weighing two hundred pounds out of  sheer exuberance.
 There's a lot of your father in you, Ann.
 I've  often noticed it.
"    "There is! That's why I'm going to make you put your foot down  sooner or later.
 You're going to turn all these loafers out of  the house.
 And first of all you're going to help us send Ogden  away to Mr. Smithers.
"    There was a long silence.
    "It's your red hair!" said Mr. Pett at length, with the air of a  man who has been solving a problem.
 "It's your red hair that  makes you like this, Ann.
 Your father has red hair, too.
"    Ann laughed.
    "It's not my fault that I have red hair, uncle Peter.
 It's my  misfortune.
"    Mr. Pett shook his head.
    "Other people's misfortune, too!" he said.
            THE EXILED FAN    London brooded under a grey sky.
 There had been rain in the  night, and the trees were still dripping.
 Presently, however,  there appeared in the leaden haze a watery patch of blue: and  through this crevice in the clouds the sun, diffidently at first  but with gradually increasing confidence, peeped down on the  fashionable and exclusive turf of Grosvenor Square.
 Stealing  across the square, its rays reached the massive stone walls of  Drexdale House, until recently the London residence of the earl  of that name; then, passing through the window of the  breakfast-room, played lightly on the partially bald head of Mr.  Bingley Crocker, late of New York in the United States of  America, as he bent over his morning paper.
 Mrs. Bingley Crocker,  busy across the table reading her mail, the rays did not touch.
  Had they done so, she would have rung for Bayliss, the butler, to  come and lower the shade, for she endured liberties neither from  Man nor from Nature.
    Mr. Crocker was about fifty years of age, clean-shaven and of a  comfortable stoutness.
 He was frowning as he read.
 His smooth,  good-humoured face wore an expression which might have been  disgust, perplexity, or a blend of both.
 His wife, on the other  hand, was looking happy.
 She extracted the substance from her  correspondence with swift glances of her compelling eyes, just as  she would have extracted guilty secrets from Bingley, if he had  had any.
 This was a woman who, like her sister Nesta, had been  able all her life to accomplish more with a glance than other  women with recrimination and threat.
 It had been a popular belief  among his friends that her late husband, the well-known Pittsburg  millionaire G.
 G.
 van Brunt, had been in the habit of  automatically confessing all if he merely caught the eye of her  photograph on his dressing table.
    From the growing pile of opened envelopes Mrs. Crocker looked up,  a smile softening the firm line of her lips.
    "A card from Lady Corstorphine, Bingley, for her at-home on the  twenty-ninth.
"    Mr. Crocker, still absorbed, snorted absently.
    "One of the most exclusive hostesses in England.
 .
 .
 .
 She has  influence with the right sort of people.
 Her brother, the Duke of  Devizes, is the Premier's oldest friend.
"    "Uh?"    "The Duchess of Axminster has written to ask me to look after a  stall at her bazaar for the Indigent Daughters of the Clergy.
"    "Huh?"    "Bingley! You aren't listening.
 What is that you are reading?"    Mr. Crocker tore himself from the paper.
    "This? Oh, I was looking at a report of that cricket game you  made me go and see yesterday.
"    "Oh? I am glad you have begun to take an interest in cricket.
 It  is simply a social necessity in England.
 Why you ever made such a  fuss about taking it up, I can't think.
 You used to be so fond of  watching baseball and cricket is just the same thing.
"    A close observer would have marked a deepening of the look of  pain on Mr. Crocker's face.
 Women say this sort of thing  carelessly, with no wish to wound: but that makes it none the  less hard to bear.
    From the hall outside came faintly the sound of the telephone,  then the measured tones of Bayliss answering it.
 Mr. Crocker  returned to his paper.
    Bayliss entered.
    "Lady Corstorphine desires to speak to you on the telephone,  madam.
"    Half-way to the door Mrs. Crocker paused, as if recalling  something that had slipped her memory.
    "Is Mr. James getting up, Bayliss?"    "I believe not, madam.
 I am informed by one of the house-maids  who passed his door a short time back that there were no sounds.
"    Mrs. Crocker left the room.
 Bayliss, preparing to follow her  example, was arrested by an exclamation from the table.
    "Say!"    His master's voice.
    "Say, Bayliss, come here a minute.
 Want to ask you something.
"    The butler approached the table.
 It seemed to him that his  employer was not looking quite himself this morning.
 There was  something a trifle wild, a little haggard, about his expression.
  He had remarked on it earlier in the morning in the Servants'  Hall.
    As a matter of fact, Mr. Crocker's ailment was a perfectly simple  one.
 He was suffering from one of those acute spasms of  home-sickness, which invariably racked him in the earlier Summer  months.
 Ever since his marriage five years previously and his  simultaneous removal from his native land he had been a chronic  victim to the complaint.
 The symptoms grew less acute in Winter  and Spring, but from May onward he suffered severely.
    Poets have dealt feelingly with the emotions of practically every  variety except one.
 They have sung of Ruth, of Israel in bondage,  of slaves pining for their native Africa, and of the miner's  dream of home.
 But the sorrows of the baseball bug, compelled by  fate to live three thousand miles away from the Polo Grounds,  have been neglected in song.
 Bingley Crocker was such a one, and  in Summer his agonies were awful.
 He pined away in a country  where they said "Well played, sir!" when they meant "'at-a-boy!"    "Bayliss, do you play cricket?"    "I am a little past the age, sir.
 In my younger days .
 .
 .
"    "Do you understand it?"    "Yes, sir.
 I frequently spend an afternoon at Lord's or the Oval  when there is a good match.
"    Many who enjoyed a merely casual acquaintance with the butler  would have looked on this as an astonishingly unexpected  revelation of humanity in Bayliss, but Mr. Crocker was not  surprised.
 To him, from the very beginning, Bayliss had been a  man and a brother who was always willing to suspend his duties in  order to answer questions dealing with the thousand and one  problems which the social life of England presented.
 Mr.  Crocker's mind had adjusted itself with difficulty to the  niceties of class distinction: and, while he had cured himself of  his early tendency to address the butler as "Bill," he never  failed to consult him as man to man in his moments of perplexity.
  Bayliss was always eager to be of assistance.
 He liked Mr.  Crocker.
 True, his manner might have struck a more sensitive man  than his employer as a shade too closely resembling that of an  indulgent father towards a son who was not quite right in the  head: but it had genuine affection in it.
    Mr. Crocker picked up his paper and folded it back at the  sporting page, pointing with a stubby forefinger.
    "Well, what does all this mean? I've kept out of watching cricket  since I landed in England, but yesterday they got the poison  needle to work and took me off to see Surrey play Kent at that  place Lord's where you say you go sometimes.
"    "I was there yesterday, sir.
 A very exciting game.
"    "Exciting? How do you make that out? I sat in the bleachers all  afternoon, waiting for something to break loose.
 Doesn't anything  ever happen at cricket?"    The butler winced a little, but managed to smile a tolerant  smile.
 This man, he reflected, was but an American and as such  more to be pitied than censured.
 He endeavoured to explain.
    "It was a sticky wicket yesterday, sir, owing to the rain.
"    "Eh?"    "The wicket was sticky, sir.
"    "Come again.
"    "I mean that the reason why the game yesterday struck you as slow  was that the wicket--I should say the turf--was sticky--that is  to say wet.
 Sticky is the technical term, sir.
 When the wicket is  sticky, the batsmen are obliged to exercise a great deal of  caution, as the stickiness of the wicket enables the bowlers to  make the ball turn more sharply in either direction as it strikes  the turf than when the wicket is not sticky.
"    "That's it, is it?"    "Yes, sir.
"    "Thanks for telling me.
"    "Not at all, sir.
"    Mr. Crocker pointed to the paper.
    "Well, now, this seems to be the box-score of the game we saw  yesterday.
 If you can make sense out of that, go to it.
"    The passage on which his finger rested was headed "Final Score,"  and ran as follows:                    SURREY                 First Innings        Hayward, c Wooley, b Carr .

 139    Bayliss inspected the cipher gravely.
    "What is it you wish me to explain, sir?"    "Why, the whole thing.
 What's it all about?"    "It's perfectly simple, sir.
 Surrey won the toss, and took first  knock.
 Hayward and Hobbs were the opening pair.
 Hayward called  Hobbs for a short run, but the latter was unable to get across  and was thrown out by mid-on.
 Hayes was the next man in.
 He went  out of his ground and was stumped.
 Ducat and Hayward made a  capital stand considering the stickiness of the wicket, until  Ducat was bowled by a good length off-break and Hayward caught at  second slip off a googly.
 Then Harrison and Sandham played out  time.
"    Mr. Crocker breathed heavily through his nose.
    "Yes!" he said.
 "Yes! I had an idea that was it.
 But I think I'd  like to have it once again, slowly.
 Start with these figures.
  What does that sixty-seven mean, opposite Hayward's name?"    "He made sixty-seven runs, sir.
"    "Sixty-seven! In one game?"    "Yes, sir.
"    "Why, Home-Run Baker couldn't do it!"    "I am not familiar with Mr. Baker, sir.
"    "I suppose you've never seen a ball-game?"    "Ball-game, sir?"    "A baseball game?"    "Never, sir.
"    "Then, Bill," said Mr. Crocker, reverting in his emotion to the  bad habit of his early London days, "you haven't lived.
 See  here!"    Whatever vestige of respect for class distinctions Mr. Crocker  had managed to preserve during the opening stages of the  interview now definitely disappeared.
 His eyes shone wildly and  he snorted like a war-horse.
 He clutched the butler by the sleeve  and drew him closer to the table, then began to move forks,  spoons, cups, and even the contents of his plate about the cloth  with an energy little short of feverish.
    "Bayliss!"    "Sir?"    "Watch!" said Mr. Crocker, with the air of an excitable high  priest about to initiate a novice into the Mysteries.
    He removed a roll from the basket.
    "You see this roll? That's the home plate.
 This spoon is first  base.
 Where I'm putting this cup is second.
 This piece of bacon  is third.
 There's your diamond for you.
 Very well, then.
 These  lumps of sugar are the infielders and the outfielders.
 Now we're  ready.
 Batter up? He stands here.
 Catcher behind him.
 Umps behind  catcher.
"    "Umps, I take it, sir, is what we would call the umpire?"    "Call him anything you like.
 It's part of the game.
 Now here's  the box, where I've put this dab of marmalade, and here's the  pitcher, winding up.
"    "The pitcher would be equivalent to our bowler?"    "I guess so, though why you should call him a bowler gets past  me.
"    "The box, then, is the bowler's wicket?"    "Have it your own way.
 Now pay attention.
 Play ball! Pitcher's  winding up.
 Put it over, Mike, put it over! Some speed, kid! Here  it comes, right in the groove.
 Bing! Batter slams it and streaks  for first.
 Outfielder--this lump of sugar--boots it.
 Bonehead!  Batter touches second.
 Third? No! Get back! Can't be done.
 Play  it safe.
 Stick around the sack, old pal.
 Second batter up.
  Pitcher getting something on the ball now besides the cover.
  Whiffs him.
 Back to the bench, Cyril! Third batter up.
 See him  rub his hands in the dirt.
 Watch this kid.
 He's good! He lets  two alone, then slams the next right on the nose.
 Whizzes around  to second.
 First guy, the one we left on second, comes home for  one run.
 That's a game! Take it from me, Bill, that's a _game!_"    Somewhat overcome with the energy with which he had flung himself  into his lecture, Mr. Crocker sat down and refreshed himself with  cold coffee.
    "Quite an interesting game," said Bayliss.
 "But I find, now that  you have explained it, sir, that it is familiar to me, though I  have always known it under another name.
 It is played a great  deal in this country.
"    Mr. Crocker started to his feet.
    "It is? And I've been five years here without finding it out!  When's the next game scheduled?"    "It is known in England as Rounders, sir.
 Children play it with a  soft ball and a racquet, and derive considerable enjoyment from  it.
 I had never heard of it before as a pastime for adults.
"    Two shocked eyes stared into the butler's face.
    "Children?" The word came in a whisper.
    "A racquet?"    "Yes, sir.
"    "You--you didn't say a soft ball?"    "Yes, sir.
"    A sort of spasm seemed to convulse Mr. Crocker.
 He had lived five  years in England, but not till this moment had he realised to the  full how utterly alone he was in an alien land.
 Fate had placed  him, bound and helpless, in a country where they called baseball  Rounders and played it with a soft ball.
    He sank back into his chair, staring before him.
 And as he sat  the wall seemed to melt and he was gazing upon a green field, in  the centre of which a man in a grey uniform was beginning a  Salome dance.
 Watching this person with a cold and suspicious  eye, stood another uniformed man, holding poised above his  shoulder a sturdy club.
 Two Masked Marvels crouched behind him in  attitudes of watchful waiting.
 On wooden seats all around sat a  vast multitude of shirt-sleeved spectators, and the air was full  of voices.
    One voice detached itself from the din.
    "Pea-nuts! Get y'r pea-nuts!"    Something that was almost a sob shook Bingley Crocker's ample  frame.
 Bayliss the butler gazed down upon him with concern.
 He  was sure the master was unwell.
    The case of Mr. Bingley Crocker was one that would have provided  an admirable "instance" for a preacher seeking to instil into an  impecunious and sceptical flock the lesson that money does not of  necessity bring with it happiness.
 And poetry has crystallised  his position in the following stanza.
        An exile from home splendour dazzles in vain.
      Oh, give me my lowly thatched cottage again;      The birds singing gaily, that came at my call,      Give me them, and that peace of mind dearer than all.
    Mr. Crocker had never lived in a thatched cottage, nor had his  relations with the birds of his native land ever reached the  stage of intimacy indicated by the poet; but substitute "Lambs  Club" for the former and "members" for the latter, and the  parallel becomes complete.
    Until the time of his second marriage Bingley Crocker had been an  actor, a snapper-up of whatever small character-parts the gods  provided.
 He had an excellent disposition, no money, and one son,  a young man of twenty-one.
 For forty-five years he had lived a  hand-to-mouth existence in which his next meal had generally come  as a pleasant surprise: and then, on an Atlantic liner, he met  the widow of G.
 G.
 van Brunt, the sole heiress to that magnate's  immense fortune.
    What Mrs. van Brunt could have seen in Bingley Crocker to cause  her to single him out from all the world passes comprehension:  but the eccentricities of Cupid are commonplace.
 It were best to  shun examination into first causes and stick to results.
 The  swift romance began and reached its climax in the ten days which  it took one of the smaller Atlantic liners to sail from Liverpool  to New York.
 Mr. Crocker was on board because he was returning  with a theatrical company from a failure in London, Mrs. van  Brunt because she had been told that the slow boats were the  steadiest.
 They began the voyage as strangers and ended it as an  engaged couple--the affair being expedited, no doubt, by the fact  that, even if it ever occurred to Bingley to resist the onslaught  on his bachelor peace, he soon realised the futility of doing so,  for the cramped conditions of ship-board intensified the always  overwhelming effects of his future bride's determined nature.
    The engagement was received in a widely differing spirit by the  only surviving blood-relations of the two principals.
 Jimmy, Mr.  Crocker's son, on being informed that his father had plighted his  troth to the widow of a prominent millionaire, displayed the  utmost gratification and enthusiasm, and at a little supper which  he gave by way of farewell to a few of his newspaper comrades and  which lasted till six in the morning, when it was broken up by  the flying wedge of waiters for which the selected restaurant is  justly famous, joyfully announced that work and he would from  then on be total strangers.
 He alluded in feeling terms to the  Providence which watches over good young men and saves them from  the blighting necessity of offering themselves in the flower of  their golden youth as human sacrifices to the Moloch of  capitalistic greed: and, having commiserated with his guests in  that a similar stroke of luck had not happened to each of them,  advised them to drown their sorrows in drink.
 Which they did.
    Far different was the attitude of Mrs. Crocker's sister, Nesta  Pett.
 She entirely disapproved of the proposed match.
 At least,  the fact that in her final interview with her sister she  described the bridegroom-to-be as a wretched mummer, a despicable  fortune-hunter, a broken-down tramp, and a sneaking, grafting  confidence-trickster lends colour to the supposition that she was  not a warm supporter of it.
 She agreed wholeheartedly with Mrs.  Crocker's suggestion that they should never speak to each other  again as long as they lived: and it was immediately after this  that the latter removed husband Bingley, step-son Jimmy, and all  her other goods and chattels to London, where they had remained  ever since.
 Whenever Mrs. Crocker spoke of America now, it was in  tones of the deepest dislike and contempt.
 Her friends were  English, and every year more exclusively of England's  aristocracy.
 She intended to become a leading figure in London  Society, and already her progress had been astonishing.
 She knew  the right people, lived in the right square, said the right  things, and thought the right thoughts: and in the Spring of her  third year had succeeded in curing Bingley of his habit of  beginning his remarks with the words "Say, lemme tell ya  something.
" Her progress, in short, was beginning to assume the  aspect of a walk-over.
    Against her complete contentment and satisfaction only one thing  militated.
 That was the behaviour of her step-son, Jimmy.
    It was of Jimmy that she spoke when, having hung the receiver on  its hook, she returned to the breakfast-room.
 Bayliss had  silently withdrawn, and Mr. Crocker was sitting in sombre silence  at the table.
    "A most fortunate thing has happened, Bingley," she said.
 "It was  most kind of dear Lady Corstorphine to ring me up.
 It seems that  her nephew, Lord Percy Whipple, is back in England.
 He has been  in Ireland for the past three years, on the staff of the Lord  Lieutenant, and only arrived in London yesterday afternoon.
 Lady  Corstorphine has promised to arrange a meeting between him and  James.
 I particularly want them to be friends.
"    "Eugenia," said Mr. Crocker in a hollow voice, "do you know they  call baseball Rounders over here, and children play it with a  soft ball?"    "James is becoming a serious problem.
 It is absolutely necessary  that he should make friends with the right kind of young men.
"    "And a racquet," said Mr. Crocker.
    "Please listen to what I am saying, Bingley.
 I am talking about  James.
 There is a crude American strain in him which seems to  grow worse instead of better.
 I was lunching with the Delafields  at the Carlton yesterday, and there, only a few tables away, was  James with an impossible young man in appalling clothes.
 It was  outrageous that James should have been seen in public at all with  such a person.
 The man had a broken nose and talked through it.
  He was saying in a loud voice that made everybody turn round  something about his left-scissors hook--whatever that may have  been.
 I discovered later that he was a low professional pugilist  from New York--a man named Spike Dillon, I think Captain Wroxton  said.
 And Jimmy was giving him lunch--at the _Carlton!_"    Mr. Crocker said nothing.
 Constant practice had made him an adept  at saying nothing when his wife was talking.
    "James must be made to realise his responsibilities.
 I shall have  to speak to him.
 I was hearing only the other day of a most  deserving man, extremely rich and lavishly generous in his  contributions to the party funds, who was only given a  knighthood, simply because he had a son who had behaved in a  manner that could not possibly be overlooked.
 The present Court  is extraordinarily strict in its views.
 James cannot be too  careful.
 A certain amount of wildness in a young man is quite  proper in the best set, provided that he is wild in the right  company.
 Every one knows that young Lord Datchet was ejected from  the Empire Music-Hall on Boat-Race night every year during his  residence at Oxford University, but nobody minds.
 The family  treats it as a joke.
 But James has such low tastes.
 Professional  pugilists! I believe that many years ago it was not unfashionable  for young men in Society to be seen about with such persons, but  those days are over.
 I shall certainly speak to James.
 He cannot  afford to call attention to himself in any way.
 That  breach-of-promise case of his three years ago, is, I hope and  trust, forgotten, but the slightest slip on his part might start  the papers talking about it again, and that would be fatal.
 The  eventual successor to a title must be quite as careful as--"    It was not, as has been hinted above, the usual practice of Mr.  Crocker to interrupt his wife when she was speaking, but he did  it now.
    "Say!"    Mrs. Crocker frowned.
    "I wish, Bingley--and I have told you so often--that you would  not begin your sentences with the word 'Say'! It is such a  revolting Americanism.
 Suppose some day when you are addressing  the House of Lords you should make a slip like that! The papers  would never let you hear the end of it.
"    Mr. Crocker was swallowing convulsively, as if testing his larynx  with a view to speech.
 Like Saul of Tarsus, he had been stricken  dumb by the sudden bright light which his wife's words had caused  to flash upon him.
 Frequently during his sojourn in London he had  wondered just why Eugenia had settled there in preference to her  own country.
 It was not her wont to do things without an object,  yet until this moment he had been unable to fathom her motives.
  Even now it seemed almost incredible.
 And yet what meaning would  her words have other than the monstrous one which had smitten him  as a blackjack?    "Say--I mean, Eugenia--you don't want--you aren't trying--you  aren't working to--you haven't any idea of trying to get them to  make me a Lord, have you?"    "It is what I have been working for all these years!"    "But--but why? Why? That's what I want to know.
 Why?"    Mrs. Crocker's fine eyes glittered.
    "I will tell you why, Bingley.
 Just before we were married I had  a talk with my sister Nesta.
 She was insufferably offensive.
 She  referred to you in terms which I shall never forgive.
 She affected  to look down on you, to think that I was marrying beneath me.
 So  I am going to make you an English peer and send Nesta a newspaper  clipping of the Birthday Honours with your name in it, if I have  to keep working till I die! Now you know!"    Silence fell.
 Mr. Crocker drank cold coffee.
 His wife stared with  gleaming eyes into the glorious future.
    "Do you mean that I shall have to stop on here till they make me  a lord?" said Mr. Crocker limply.
    "Yes.
"    "Never go back to America?"    "Not till we have succeeded.
"    "Oh Gee! Oh Gosh! Oh Hell!" said Mr. Crocker, bursting the bonds  of years.
    Mrs. Crocker though resolute, was not unkindly.
 She made  allowances for her husband's state of mind.
 She was willing to  permit even American expletives during the sinking-in process of  her great idea, much as a broad-minded cowboy might listen  indulgently to the squealing of a mustang during the branding  process.
 Docility and obedience would be demanded of him later,  but not till the first agony had abated.
 She spoke soothingly to  him.
    "I am glad we have had this talk, Bingley.
 It is best that you  should know.
 It will help you to realise your responsibilities.
  And that brings me back to James.
 Thank goodness Lord Percy  Whipple is in town.
 He is about James' age, and from what Lady  Corstorphine tells me will be an ideal friend for him.
 You  understand who he is, of course? The second son of the Duke of  Devizes, the Premier's closest friend, the man who can  practically dictate the Birthday Honours.
 If James and Lord Percy  can only form a close friendship, our battle will be as good as  won.
 It will mean everything.
 Lady Corstorphine has promised to  arrange a meeting.
 In the meantime, I will speak to James and  warn him to be more careful.
"    Mr. Crocker had produced a stump of pencil from his pocket and  was writing on the table-cloth.
        Lord Crocker      Lord Bingley Crocker      Lord Crocker of Crocker      The Marquis of Crocker      Baron Crocker      Bingley, first Viscount Crocker    He blanched as he read the frightful words.
 A sudden thought stung  him.
    "Eugenia!"    "Well?"    "What will the boys at the Lambs say?"    "I am not interested," replied his wife, "in the boys at the  Lambs.
"    "I thought you wouldn't be," said the future baron gloomily.
            FAMILY JARS    It is a peculiarity of the human mind that, with whatever  apprehension it may be regarding the distant future, it must  return after a while to face the minor troubles of the future  that is immediate.
 The prospect of a visit to the dentist this  afternoon causes us to forget for the moment the prospect of  total ruin next year.
 Mr. Crocker, therefore, having tortured  himself for about a quarter of an hour with his meditations on  the subject of titles, was jerked back to a more imminent  calamity than the appearance of his name in the Birthday  Honours--the fact that in all probability he would be taken again  this morning to watch the continuation of that infernal  cricket-match, and would be compelled to spend the greater part  of to-day, as he had spent the greater part of yesterday, bored  to the verge of dissolution in the pavilion at Lord's.
    One gleam of hope alone presented itself.
 Like baseball, this  pastime of cricket was apparently affected by rain, if there had  been enough of it.
 He had an idea that there had been a good deal  of rain in the night, but had there been sufficient to cause the  teams of Surrey and Kent to postpone the second instalment of  their serial struggle? He rose from the table and went out into  the hall.
 It was his purpose to sally out into Grosvenor Square  and examine the turf in its centre with the heel of his shoe, in  order to determine the stickiness or non-stickiness of the  wicket.
 He moved towards the front door, hoping for the best, and  just as he reached it the bell rang.
    One of the bad habits of which his wife had cured Mr. Crocker in  the course of the years was the habit of going and answering  doors.
 He had been brought up in surroundings where every man was  his own door-keeper, and it had been among his hardest tasks to  learn the lesson that the perfect gentleman does not open doors  but waits for the appropriate menial to come along and do it for  him.
 He had succeeded at length in mastering this great truth,  and nowadays seldom offended.
 But this morning his mind was  clouded by his troubles, and instinct, allaying itself with  opportunity, was too much for him.
 His fingers had been on the  handle when the ring came, so he turned it.
    At the top of the steps which connect the main entrance of  Drexdale House with the sidewalk three persons were standing.
 One  was a tall and formidably handsome woman in the early forties  whose appearance seemed somehow oddly familiar.
 The second was a  small, fat, blobby, bulging boy who was chewing something.
 The  third, lurking diffidently in the rear, was a little man of about  Mr. Crocker's own age, grey-haired and thin with brown eyes that  gazed meekly through rimless glasses.
    Nobody could have been less obtrusive than this person, yet it was  he who gripped Mr. Crocker's attention and caused that home-sick  sufferer's heart to give an almost painful leap.
 For he was  clothed in one of those roomy suits with square shoulders which  to the seeing eye are as republican as the Stars and Stripes.
 His  blunt-toed yellow shoes sang gaily of home.
 And his hat was not  so much a hat as an effusive greeting from Gotham.
 A long time  had passed since Mr. Crocker had set eyes upon a biped so  exhilaratingly American, and rapture held him speechless, as one  who after long exile beholds some landmark of his childhood.
    The female member of the party took advantage of his  dumbness--which, as she had not unnaturally mistaken him for the  butler, she took for a silent and respectful query as to her  business and wishes--to open the conversation.
    "Is Mrs. Crocker at home? Please tell her that Mrs. Pett wishes  to see her.
"    There was a rush and scurry in the corridors of Mr. Crocker's  brain, as about six different thoughts tried to squash  simultaneously into that main chamber where there is room for  only one at a time.
 He understood now why this woman's appearance  had seemed familiar.
 She was his wife's sister, and that same  Nesta who was some day to be pulverised by the sight of his name  in the Birthday Honours.
 He was profoundly thankful that she had  mistaken him for the butler.
 A chill passed through him as he  pictured what would have been Eugenia's reception of the  information that he had committed such a bourgeois solecism as  opening the front door to Mrs. Pett of all people, who already  despised him as a low vulgarian.
 There had been trouble enough  when she had found him opening it a few weeks before to a mere  collector of subscriptions for a charity.
 He perceived, with a  clarity remarkable in view of the fact that the discovery of her  identity had given him a feeling of physical dizziness, that at  all costs he must foster this misapprehension on his  sister-in-law's part.
    Fortunately he was in a position to do so.
 He knew all about what  butlers did and what they said on these occasions, for in his  innocently curious way he had often pumped Bayliss on the subject.
  He bowed silently and led the way to the morning-room, followed  by the drove of Petts: then, opening the door, stood aside to  allow the procession to march past the given point.
    "I will inform Mrs. Crocker that you are here, madam.
"    Mrs. Pett, shepherding the chewing child before her, passed into  the room.
 In the light of her outspoken sentiments regarding her  brother-in-law, it is curious to reflect that his manner at this,  their first meeting, had deeply impressed her.
 After many months  of smouldering revolt she had dismissed her own butler a day or  so before sailing for England, and for the first time envy of her  sister Eugenia gripped her.
 She did not covet Eugenia's other  worldly possessions, but she did grudge her this supreme butler.
    Mr. Pett, meanwhile, had been trailing in the rear with a hunted  expression on his face.
 He wore the unmistakable look of a man  about to be present at a row between women, and only a wet cat in  a strange back-yard bears itself with less jauntiness than a man  faced by such a prospect.
 A millionaire several times over, Mr.  Pett would cheerfully have given much of his wealth to have been  elsewhere at that moment.
 Such was the agitated state of his mind  that, when a hand was laid lightly upon his arm as he was about  to follow his wife into the room, he started so violently that  his hat flew out of his hand.
 He turned to meet the eyes of the  butler who had admitted him to the house, fixed on his in an  appealing stare.
    "Who's leading in the pennant race?" said this strange butler in  a feverish whisper.
    It was a question, coming from such a source, which in another  than Mr. Pett might well have provoked a blank stare of  amazement.
 Such, however, is the almost superhuman intelligence  and quickness of mind engendered by the study of America's  national game that he answered without the slightest hesitation.
    "Giants!"    "Wow!" said the butler.
    No sense of anything strange or untoward about the situation came  to mar the perfect joy of Mr. Pett, the overmastering joy of the  baseball fan who in a strange land unexpectedly encounters a  brother.
 He thrilled with a happiness which he had never hoped  to feel that morning.
    "No signs of them slumping?" enquired the butler.
    "No.
 But you never can tell.
 It's early yet.
 I've seen those boys  lead the league till the end of August and then be nosed out.
"    "True enough," said the butler sadly.
    "Matty's in shape.
"    "He is? The old souper working well?"    "Like a machine.
 He shut out the Cubs the day before I sailed!"    "Fine!"    At this point an appreciation of the unusualness of the  proceedings began to steal upon Mr. Pett.
 He gaped at this  surprising servitor.
    "How on earth do you know anything about baseball?" he demanded.
    The other seemed to stiffen.
 A change came over his whole  appearance.
 He had the air of an actor who has remembered his  part.
    "I beg your pardon, sir.
 I trust I have not taken a liberty.
 I was  at one time in the employment of a gentleman in New York, and  during my stay I became extremely interested in the national  game.
 I picked up a few of the American idioms while in the  country.
" He smiled apologetically.
 "They sometimes slip out.
"    "Let 'em slip!" said Mr. Pett with enthusiasm.
 "You're the first  thing that's reminded me of home since I left.
 Say!"    "Sir?"    "Got a good place here?"    "Er--oh, yes, sir.
"    "Well, here's my card.
 If you ever feel like making a change,  there's a job waiting for you at that address.
"    "Thank you, sir.
" Mr. Crocker stooped.
    "Your hat, sir.
"    He held it out, gazing fondly at it the while.
 It was like being  home again to see a hat like that.
 He followed Mr. Pett as he  went into the morning-room with an affectionate eye.
    Bayliss was coming along the hall, hurrying more than his wont.
  The ring at the front door had found him deep in an extremely  interesting piece of news in his halfpenny morning paper, and he  was guiltily aware of having delayed in answering it.
    "Bayliss," said Mr. Crocker in a cautious undertone, "go and tell  Mrs. Crocker that Mrs. Pett is waiting to see her.
 She's in the  morning-room.
 If you're asked, say you let her in.
 Get me?"    "Yes, sir," said Bayliss, grateful for this happy solution.
    "Oh, Bayliss!"    "Sir?"    "Is the wicket at Lord's likely to be too sticky for them to go  on with that game to-day?"    "I hardly think it probable that there will be play, sir.
 There  was a great deal of rain in the night.
"    Mr. Crocker passed on to his den with a lighter heart.
                                                It was Mrs. Crocker's habit, acquired after years of practice and  a sedulous study of the best models, to conceal beneath a mask of  well-bred indifference any emotion which she might chance to  feel.
 Her dealings with the aristocracy of England had shown her  that, while the men occasionally permitted themselves an  outburst, the women never did, and she had schooled herself so  rigorously that nowadays she seldom even raised her voice.
 Her  bearing, as she approached the morning-room was calm and serene,  but inwardly curiosity consumed her.
 It was unbelievable that  Nesta could have come to try to effect a reconciliation, yet she  could think of no other reason for her visit.
    She was surprised to find three persons in the morning-room.
  Bayliss, delivering his message, had mentioned only Mrs. Pett.
 To  Mrs. Crocker the assemblage had the appearance of being a sort of  Old Home Week of Petts, a kind of Pett family mob-scene.
 Her  sister's second marriage having taken place after their quarrel,  she had never seen her new brother-in-law, but she assumed that  the little man lurking in the background was Mr. Pett.
 The guess  was confirmed.
    "Good morning, Eugenia," said Mrs. Pett.
    "Peter, this is my sister, Eugenia.
 My husband.
"    Mrs. Crocker bowed stiffly.
 She was thinking how hopelessly  American Mr. Pett was, how baggy his clothes looked, what  absurdly shaped shoes he wore, how appalling his hat was, how  little hair he had and how deplorably he lacked all those graces  of repose, culture, physical beauty, refinement, dignity, and  mental alertness which raise men above the level of the common  cock-roach.
    Mr. Pett, on his side, receiving her cold glance squarely between  the eyes, felt as if he were being disembowelled by a clumsy  amateur.
 He could not help wondering what sort of a man this  fellow Crocker was whom this sister-in-law of his had married.
 He  pictured him as a handsome, powerful, robust individual with a  strong jaw and a loud voice, for he could imagine no lesser type  of man consenting to link his lot with such a woman.
 He sidled in  a circuitous manner towards a distant chair, and, having lowered  himself into it, kept perfectly still, pretending to be dead,  like an opossum.
 He wished to take no part whatever in the coming  interview.
    "Ogden, of course, you know," said Mrs. Pett.
    She was sitting so stiffly upright on a hard chair and had so  much the appearance of having been hewn from the living rock that  every time she opened her mouth it was as if a statue had spoken.
    "I know Ogden," said Mrs. Crocker shortly.
 "Will you please stop  him fidgeting with that vase? It is valuable.
"    She directed at little Ogden, who was juggling aimlessly with a  handsome _objet d'art_ of the early Chinese school, a glance similar  to that which had just disposed of his step-father.
 But Ogden  required more than a glance to divert him from any pursuit in which  he was interested.
 He shifted a deposit of candy from his right  cheek to his left cheek, inspected Mrs. Crocker for a moment with a  pale eye, and resumed his juggling.
 Mrs. Crocker meant nothing in  his young life.
    "Ogden, come and sit down," said Mrs. Pett.
    "Don't want to sit down.
"    "Are you making a long stay in England, Nesta?" asked Mrs.  Crocker coldly.
    "I don't know.
 We have made no plans.
"    "Indeed?"    She broke off.
 Ogden, who had possessed himself of a bronze  paper-knife, had begun to tap the vase with it.
 The ringing note  thus produced appeared to please his young mind.
    "If Ogden really wishes to break that vase," said Mrs. Crocker in  a detached voice, "let me ring for the butler to bring him a  hammer.
"    "Ogden!" said Mrs. Pett.
    "Oh Gee! A fellow can't do a thing!" muttered Ogden, and walked  to the window.
 He stood looking out into the square, a slight  twitching of the ears indicating that he still made progress with  the candy.
    "Still the same engaging child!" murmured Mrs. Crocker.
    "I did not come here to discuss Ogden!" said Mrs. Pett.
    Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows.
 Not even Mrs. Otho Lanners,  from whom she had learned the art, could do it more effectively.
    "I am still waiting to find out why you did come, Nesta!"    "I came here to talk to you about your step-son, James Crocker.
"    The discipline to which Mrs. Crocker had subjected herself in the  matter of the display of emotion saved her from the humiliation  of showing surprise.
 She waved her hand graciously--in the manner  of the Duchess of Axminster, a supreme hand-waver--to indicate  that she was all attention.
    "Your step-son, James Crocker," repeated Mrs. Pett.
 "What is it  the New York papers call him, Peter?"    Mr. Pett, the human opossum, came to life.
 He had contrived to  create about himself such a defensive atmosphere of non-existence  that now that he re-entered the conversation it was as if a  corpse had popped out of its tomb like a jack-in-the-box.
    Obeying the voice of authority, he pushed the tombstone to one  side and poked his head out of the sepulchre.
    "Piccadilly Jim!" he murmured apologetically.
    "Piccadilly Jim!" said Mrs. Crocker.
 "It is extremely impertinent  of them!"    In spite of his misery, a wan smile appeared on Mr. Pett's  death-mask at this remark.
    "They should worry about--!"    "Peter!"    Mr. Pett died again, greatly respected.
    "Why should the New York papers refer to James at all?" said Mrs.  Crocker.
    "Explain, Peter!"    Mr. Pett emerged reluctantly from the cerements.
 He had supposed  that Nesta would do the talking.
    "Well, he's a news-item.
"    "Why?"    "Well, here's a boy that's been a regular fellow--raised in  America--done work on a newspaper--suddenly taken off to England  to become a London dude--mixing with all the dukes, playing  pinochle with the King--naturally they're interested in him.
"    A more agreeable expression came over Mrs. Crocker's face.
    "Of course, that is quite true.
 One cannot prevent the papers  from printing what they wish.
 So they have published articles  about James' doings in English Society?"    "Doings," said Mr. Pett, "is right!"    "Something has got to be done about it," said Mrs. Pett.
    Mr. Pett endorsed this.
    "Nesta's going to lose her health if these stories go on," he  said.
    Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows, but she had hard work to keep a  contented smile off her face.
    "If you are not above petty jealousy, Nesta .
 .
 .
"    Mrs. Pett laughed a sharp, metallic laugh.
    "It is the disgrace I object to!"    "The disgrace!"    "What else would you call it, Eugenia? Wouldn't you be ashamed if  you opened your Sunday paper and came upon a full page article  about your nephew having got intoxicated at the races and fought  a book-maker--having broken up a political meeting--having been  sued for breach-of-promise by a barmaid .
 .
 .
"    Mrs. Crocker preserved her well-bred calm, but she was shaken.
  The episodes to which her sister had alluded were ancient  history, horrors of the long-dead past, but it seemed that they  still lived in print.
 There and then she registered the resolve  to talk to her step-son James when she got hold of him in such a  manner as would scourge the offending Adam out of him for once  and for all.
    "And not only that," continued Mrs. Pett.
 "That would be bad enough  in itself, but somehow the papers have discovered that I am the  boy's aunt.
 Two weeks ago they printed my photograph with one of  these articles.
 I suppose they will always do it now.
 That is why I  have come to you.
 It must stop.
 And the only way it can be made to  stop is by taking your step-son away from London where he is  running wild.
 Peter has most kindly consented to give the boy a  position in his office.
 It is very good of him, for the boy cannot  in the nature of things be of any use for a very long time, but we  have talked it over and it seems the only course.
 I have come this  morning to ask you to let us take James Crocker back to America  with us and keep him out of mischief by giving him honest work.
  What do you say?"    Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows.
    "What do you expect me to say? It is utterly preposterous.
 I have  never heard anything so supremely absurd in my life.
"    "You refuse?"    "Of course I refuse.
"    "I think you are extremely foolish.
"    "Indeed!"    Mr. Pett cowed in his chair.
 He was feeling rather like a nervous  and peace-loving patron of a wild western saloon who observes two  cowboys reach for their hip-pockets.
 Neither his wife nor his  sister-in-law paid any attention to him.
 The concluding exercises  of a duel of the eyes was in progress between them.
 After some  silent, age-long moments, Mrs. Crocker laughed a light laugh.
    "Most extraordinary!" she murmured.
    Mrs. Pett was in no mood for Anglicisms.
    "You know perfectly well, Eugenia," she said heatedly, "that  James Crocker is being ruined here.
 For his sake, if not for  mine--"    Mrs. Crocker laughed another light laugh, one of those offensive  rippling things which cause so much annoyance.
    "Don't be so ridiculous, Nesta! Ruined! Really! It is quite true  that, a long while ago, when he was much younger and not quite used  to the ways of London Society, James was a little wild, but all  that sort of thing is over now.
 He knows"--she paused, setting  herself as it were for the punch--"he knows that at any moment  the government may decide to give his father a Peerage .
 .
 .
"    The blow went home.
 A quite audible gasp escaped her stricken  sister.
    "What!"    Mrs. Crocker placed two ringed fingers before her mouth in order  not to hide a languid yawn.
    "Yes.
 Didn't you know? But of course you live so out of the world.
  Oh yes, it is extremely probable that Mr. Crocker's name will  appear in the next Honours List.
 He is very highly thought of by  the Powers.
 So naturally James is quite aware that he must behave  in a suitable manner.
 He is a dear boy! He was handicapped at  first by getting into the wrong set, but now his closest friend  is Lord Percy Whipple, the second son of the Duke of Devizes, who  is one of the most eminent men in the kingdom and a personal  friend of the Premier.
"    Mrs. Pett was in bad shape under this rain of titles, but she  rallied herself to reply in kind.
    "Indeed?" she said.
 "I should like to meet him.
 I have no doubt  he knows our great friend, Lord Wisbeach.
"    Mrs. Crocker was a little taken aback.
 She had not supposed that  her sister had even this small shot in her locker.
    "Do you know Lord Wisbeach?" she said.
    "Oh yes," replied Mrs. Pett, beginning to feel a little better.
  "We have been seeing him every day.
 He always says that he looks  on my house as quite a home.
 He knows so few people in New York.
  It has been a great comfort to him, I think, knowing us.
"    Mrs. Crocker had had time now to recover her poise.
    "Poor dear Wizzy!" she said languidly.
    Mrs. Pett started.
    "What!"    "I suppose he is still the same dear, stupid, shiftless fellow?  He left here with the intention of travelling round the world,  and he has stopped in New York! How like him!"    "Do you know Lord Wisbeach?" demanded Mrs. Pett.
    Mrs. Crocker raised her eyebrows.
    "Know him? Why, I suppose, after Lord Percy Whipple, he is James'  most intimate friend!"    Mrs. Pett rose.
 She was dignified even in defeat.
 She collected  Ogden and Mr. Pett with an eye which even Ogden could see was not  to be trifled with.
 She uttered no word.
    "Must you really go?" said Mrs. Crocker.
 "It was sweet of you to  bother to come all the way from America like this.
 So strange to  meet any one from America nowadays.
 Most extraordinary!"    The _cortege_ left the room in silence.
 Mrs. Crocker had touched  the bell, but the mourners did not wait for the arrival of  Bayliss.
 They were in no mood for the formalities of polite  Society.
 They wanted to be elsewhere, and they wanted to be there  quick.
 The front door had closed behind them before the butler  reached the morning-room.
    "Bayliss," said Mrs. Crocker with happy, shining face, "send for  the car to come round at once.
"    "Very good, madam.
"    "Is Mr. James up yet?"    "I believe not, madam.
"    Mrs. Crocker went upstairs to her room.
 If Bayliss had not been  within earshot, she would probably have sung a bar or two.
 Her  amiability extended even to her step-son, though she had not  altered her intention of speaking eloquently to him on certain  matters when she could get hold of him.
 That, however, could  wait.
 For the moment, she felt in vein for a gentle drive in the  Park.
    A few minutes after she had disappeared, there was a sound of  slow footsteps on the stairs, and a young man came down into the  hall.
 Bayliss, who had finished telephoning to the garage for  Mrs. Crocker's limousine and was about to descend to those lower  depths where he had his being, turned, and a grave smile of  welcome played over his face.
    "Good morning, Mr. James," he said.
            JIMMY'S DISTURBING NEWS    Jimmy Crocker was a tall and well-knit young man who later on in  the day would no doubt be at least passably good-looking.
 At the  moment an unbecoming pallor marred his face, and beneath his eyes  were marks that suggested that he had slept little and ill.
 He  stood at the foot of the stairs, yawning cavernously.
    "Bayliss," he said, "have you been painting yourself yellow?"    "No, sir.
"    "Strange! Your face looks a bright gamboge to me, and your  outlines wobble.
 Bayliss, never mix your drinks.
 I say this to  you as a friend.
 Is there any one in the morning-room?"    "No, Mr. James.
"    "Speak softly, Bayliss, for I am not well.
 I am conscious of a  strange weakness.
 Lead me to the morning-room, then, and lay me  gently on a sofa.
 These are the times that try men's souls.
"    The sun was now shining strongly through the windows of the  morning-room.
 Bayliss lowered the shades.
 Jimmy Crocker sank onto  the sofa, and closed his eyes.
    "Bayliss.
"    "Sir?"    "A conviction is stealing over me that I am about to expire.
"    "Shall I bring you a little breakfast, Mr. James?"    A strong shudder shook Jimmy.
    "Don't be flippant, Bayliss," he protested.
 "Try to cure yourself  of this passion for being funny at the wrong time.
 Your comedy is  good, but tact is a finer quality than humour.
 Perhaps you think  I have forgotten that morning when I was feeling just as I do  to-day and you came to my bedside and asked me if I would like a  nice rasher of ham.
 I haven't and I never shall.
 You may bring me  a brandy-and-soda.
 Not a large one.
 A couple of bath-tubs full  will be enough.
"    "Very good, Mr. James.
"    "And now leave me, Bayliss, for I would be alone.
 I have to make  a series of difficult and exhaustive tests to ascertain whether I  am still alive.
"    When the butler had gone, Jimmy adjusted the cushions, closed his  eyes, and remained for a space in a state of coma.
 He was trying,  as well as an exceedingly severe headache would permit, to recall  the salient events of the previous night.
 At present his memories  refused to solidify.
 They poured about in his brain in a fluid  and formless condition, exasperating to one who sought for hard  facts.
    It seemed strange to Jimmy that the shadowy and inchoate vision of  a combat, a fight, a brawl of some kind persisted in flitting  about in the recesses of his mind, always just far enough away to  elude capture.
 The absurdity of the thing annoyed him.
 A man has  either indulged in a fight overnight or he has not indulged in a  fight overnight.
 There can be no middle course.
 That he should be  uncertain on the point was ridiculous.
 Yet, try as he would, he  could not be sure.
 There were moments when he seemed on the very  verge of settling the matter, and then some invisible person  would meanly insert a red-hot corkscrew in the top of his head  and begin to twist it, and this would interfere with calm  thought.
 He was still in a state of uncertainty when Bayliss  returned, bearing healing liquids on a tray.
    "Shall I set it beside you, sir?"    Jimmy opened one eye.
    "Indubitably.
 No mean word, that, Bayliss, for the morning after.
  Try it yourself next time.
 Bayliss, who let me in this morning?"    "Let you in, sir?"    "Precisely.
 I was out and now I am in.
 Obviously I must have  passed the front door somehow.
 This is logic.
"    "I fancy you let yourself in, Mr. James, with your key.
"    "That would seem to indicate that I was in a state of icy  sobriety.
 Yet, if such is the case, how is it that I can't  remember whether I murdered somebody or not last night? It isn't  the sort of thing your sober man would lightly forget.
 Have you  ever murdered anybody, Bayliss?"    "No, sir.
"    "Well, if you had, you would remember it next morning?"    "I imagine so, Mr. James.
"    "Well, it's a funny thing, but I can't get rid of the impression  that at some point in my researches into the night life of London  yestreen I fell upon some person to whom I had never been  introduced and committed mayhem upon his person.
"    It seemed to Bayliss that the time had come to impart to Mr. James  a piece of news which he had supposed would require no imparting.
  He looked down upon his young master's recumbent form with a  grave commiseration.
 It was true that he had never been able to  tell with any certainty whether Mr. James intended the statements  he made to be taken literally or not, but on the present occasion  he seemed to have spoken seriously and to be genuinely at a loss  to recall an episode over the printed report of which the entire  domestic staff had been gloating ever since the arrival of the  halfpenny morning paper to which they subscribed.
    "Do you really mean it, Mr. James?" he enquired cautiously.
    "Mean what?"    "You have really forgotten that you were engaged in a fracas last  night at the Six Hundred Club?"    Jimmy sat up with a jerk, staring at this omniscient man.
 Then  the movement having caused a renewal of the operations of the  red-hot corkscrew, he fell back again with a groan.
    "Was I? How on earth did you know? Why should you know all about  it when I can't remember a thing? It was my fault, not yours.
"    "There is quite a long report of it in to-day's _Daily Sun_, Mr.  James.
"    "A report? In the _Sun_?"    "Half a column, Mr. James.
 Would you like me to fetch the paper?  I have it in my pantry.
"    "I should say so.
 Trot a quick heat back with it.
 This wants  looking into.
"    Bayliss retired, to return immediately with the paper.
 Jimmy took  it, gazed at it, and handed it back.
    "I overestimated my powers.
 It can't be done.
 Have you any  important duties at the moment, Bayliss?"    "No, sir.
"    "Perhaps you wouldn't mind reading me the bright little excerpt,  then?"    "Certainly, sir.
"    "It will be good practice for you.
 I am convinced I am going to be  a confirmed invalid for the rest of my life, and it will be part  of your job to sit at my bedside and read to me.
 By the way, does  the paper say who the party of the second part was? Who was the  citizen with whom I went to the mat?"    "Lord Percy Whipple, Mr. James.
"    "Lord who?"    "Lord Percy Whipple.
"    "Never heard of him.
 Carry on, Bayliss.
"    Jimmy composed himself to listen, yawning.
            THE MORNING AFTER    Bayliss took a spectacle-case from the recesses of his costume,  opened it, took out a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, dived into the  jungle again, came out with a handkerchief, polished the  spectacles, put them on his nose, closed the case, restored it to  its original position, replaced the handkerchief, and took up the  paper.
    "Why the hesitation, Bayliss? Why the coyness?" enquired Jimmy,  lying with closed eyes.
 "Begin!"    "I was adjusting my glasses, sir.
"    "All set now?"    "Yes, sir.
 Shall I read the headlines first?"    "Read everything.
"    The butler cleared his throat.
    "Good Heavens, Bayliss," moaned Jimmy, starting, "don't gargle.
  Have a heart! Go on!"    Bayliss began to read.
             FRACAS IN FASHIONABLE NIGHT-CLUB                 SPRIGS OF NOBILITY BRAWL    Jimmy opened his eyes, interested.
    "Am I a sprig of nobility?"    "It is what the paper says, sir.
"    "We live and learn.
 Carry on.
"    The butler started to clear his throat, but checked himself.
             SENSATIONAL INTERNATIONAL CONTEST                       BATTLING PERCY                         (England)                             v                        CYCLONE JIM                         (America)               FULL DESCRIPTION BY OUR EXPERT    Jimmy sat up.
    "Bayliss, you're indulging that distorted sense of humour of  yours again.
 That isn't in the paper?"    "Yes, sir.
 Very large headlines.
"    Jimmy groaned.
    "Bayliss, I'll give you a piece of advice which may be useful to  you when you grow up.
 Never go about with newspaper men.
 It all  comes back to me.
 Out of pure kindness of heart I took young Bill  Blake of the _Sun_ to supper at the Six Hundred last night.
 This is  my reward.
 I suppose he thinks it funny.
 Newspaper men are a low  lot, Bayliss.
"    "Shall I go on, sir?"    "Most doubtless.
 Let me hear all.
"    Bayliss resumed.
 He was one of those readers who, whether their  subject be a murder case or a funny anecdote, adopt a measured  and sepulchral delivery which gives a suggestion of tragedy and  horror to whatever they read.
 At the church which he attended on  Sundays, of which he was one of the most influential and  respected members, children would turn pale and snuggle up to  their mothers when Bayliss read the lessons.
 Young Mr. Blake's  account of the overnight proceedings at the Six Hundred Club he  rendered with a gloomy gusto more marked even than his wont.
 It  had a topical interest for him which urged him to extend himself.
    "At an early hour this morning, when our myriad readers  were enjoying that refreshing and brain-restoring sleep so  necessary to the proper appreciation of the _Daily Sun_ at  the breakfast table, one of the most interesting sporting  events of the season was being pulled off at the Six  Hundred Club in Regent Street, where, after three rounds  of fast exchanges, James B.
 Crocker, the well-known  American welter-weight scrapper, succeeded in stopping  Lord Percy Whipple, second son of the Duke of Devizes,  better known as the Pride of Old England.
 Once again the  superiority of the American over the English style of  boxing was demonstrated.
 Battling Percy has a kind heart,  but Cyclone Jim packs the punch.
"    "The immediate cause of the encounter had to do with a  disputed table, which each gladiator claimed to have  engaged in advance over the telephone.
"    "I begin to remember," said Jimmy meditatively.
 "A pill with  butter-coloured hair tried to jump my claim.
 Honeyed words  proving fruitless, I soaked him on the jaw.
 It may be that I was  not wholly myself.
 I seem to remember an animated session at the  Empire earlier in the evening, which may have impaired my  self-control.
 Proceed!"    "One word leading to others, which in their turn led to  several more, Cyclone Jim struck Battling Percy on what  our rude forefathers were accustomed to describe as the  mazzard, and the gong sounded for                    "ROUND ONE    "Both men came up fresh and eager to mix things, though it  seems only too probable that they had already been mixing  more things than was good for them.
 Battling Percy tried a  right swing which got home on a waiter.
 Cyclone Jim put in  a rapid one-two punch which opened a large gash in the  atmosphere.
 Both men sparred cautiously, being hampered in  their movements by the fact, which neither had at this  stage of the proceedings perceived, that they were on  opposite sides of the disputed table.
 A clever Fitzsimmons'  shift on the part of the Battler removed this obstacle,  and some brisk work ensued in neutral territory.
 Percy  landed twice without a return.
 The Battler's round by a  shade.
                    "ROUND TWO    "The Cyclone came out of his corner with a rush, getting  home on the Battler's shirt-front and following it up with  a right to the chin.
 Percy swung wildly and upset a bottle  of champagne on a neighbouring table.
 A good rally  followed, both men doing impressive in-fighting.
 The  Cyclone landed three without a return.
 The Cyclone's  round.
                    "ROUND THREE    "Percy came up weak, seeming to be overtrained.
 The  Cyclone waded in, using both hands effectively.
 The  Battler fell into a clinch, but the Cyclone broke away  and, measuring his distance, picked up a haymaker from the  floor and put it over.
 Percy down and out.
    "Interviewed by our representative after the fight,  Cyclone Jim said: 'The issue was never in doubt.
 I was  handicapped at the outset by the fact that I was under the  impression that I was fighting three twin-brothers, and I  missed several opportunities of putting over the winning  wallop by attacking the outside ones.
 It was only in the  second round that I decided to concentrate my assault on  the one in the middle, when the affair speedily came to a  conclusion.
 I shall not adopt pugilism as a profession.
  The prizes are attractive, but it is too much like work.
'"    Bayliss ceased, and silence fell upon the room.
    "Is that all?"    "That is all, sir.
"    "And about enough.
"    "Very true, sir.
"    "You know, Bayliss," said Jimmy thoughtfully, rolling over on the  couch, "life is peculiar, not to say odd.
 You never know what is  waiting for you round the corner.
 You start the day with the  fairest prospects, and before nightfall everything is as rocky  and ding-basted as stig tossed full of doodlegammon.
 Why is this,  Bayliss?"    "I couldn't say, sir.
"    "Look at me.
 I go out to spend a happy evening, meaning no harm  to any one, and I come back all blue with the blood of the  aristocracy.
 We now come to a serious point.
 Do you think my  lady stepmother has read that sporting chronicle?"    "I fancy not, Mr. James.
"    "On what do you base these words of comfort?"    "Mrs. Crocker does not read the halfpenny papers, sir.
"    "True! She does not.
 I had forgotten.
 On the other hand the  probability that she will learn about the little incident from  other sources is great.
 I think the merest prudence suggests that  I keep out of the way for the time being, lest I be fallen upon  and questioned.
 I am not equal to being questioned this morning.
  I have a headache which starts at the soles of my feet and gets  worse all the way up.
 Where is my stepmother?"    "Mrs. Crocker is in her room, Mr. James.
 She ordered the car to  be brought round at once.
 It should be here at any moment now,  sir.
 I think Mrs. Crocker intends to visit the Park before  luncheon.
"    "Is she lunching out?"    "Yes, sir.
"    "Then, if I pursue the excellent common-sense tactics of the  lesser sand-eel, which as you doubtless know buries itself tail  upwards in the mud on hearing the baying of the eel-hounds and  remains in that position till the danger is past, I shall be able  to postpone an interview.
 Should you be questioned as to my  whereabouts, inflate your chest and reply in a clear and manly  voice that I have gone out, you know not where.
 May I rely on  your benevolent neutrality, Bayliss?"    "Very good, Mr. James.
"    "I think I will go and sit in my father's den.
 A man may lie hid  there with some success as a rule.
"    Jimmy heaved himself painfully off the sofa, blinked, and set out  for the den, where his father, in a deep arm-chair, was smoking a  restful pipe and reading the portions of the daily papers which  did not deal with the game of cricket.
    Mr. Crocker's den was a small room at the back of the house.
 It  was not luxurious, and it looked out onto a blank wall, but it  was the spot he liked best in all that vast pile which had once  echoed to the tread of titled shoes; for, as he sometimes  observed to his son, it had the distinction of being the only  room on the ground floor where a fellow could move without  stubbing his toe on a countess or an honourable.
 In this peaceful  backwater he could smoke a pipe, put his feet up, take off his  coat, and generally indulge in that liberty and pursuit of  happiness to which the Constitution entitles a free-born  American.
 Nobody ever came there except Jimmy and himself.
    He did not suspend his reading at his son's entrance.
 He muttered  a welcome through the clouds, but he did not raise his eyes.
  Jimmy took the other arm-chair, and began to smoke silently.
 It  was the unwritten law of the den that soothing silence rather  than aimless chatter should prevail.
 It was not until a quarter  of an hour had passed that Mr. Crocker dropped his paper and  spoke.
    "Say, Jimmy, I want to talk to you.
"    "Say on.
 You have our ear.
"    "Seriously.
"    "Continue--always, however, keeping before you the fact that I am  a sick man.
 Last night was a wild night on the moors, dad.
"    "It's about your stepmother.
 She was talking at breakfast about  you.
 She's sore at you for giving Spike Dillon lunch at the  Carlton.
 You oughtn't to have taken him there, Jimmy.
 That's what  got her goat.
 She was there with a bunch of swells and they had  to sit and listen to Spike talking about his half-scissors hook.
"    "What's their kick against Spike's half-scissors hook? It's a  darned good one.
"    "She said she was going to speak to you about it.
 I thought I'd  let you know.
"    "Thanks, dad.
 But was that all?"    "All.
"    "All that she was going to speak to me about? Sure there was  nothing else?"    "She didn't say anything about anything else.
"    "Then she _doesn't_ know! Fine!"    Mr. Crocker's feet came down from the mantelpiece with a crash.
    "Jimmy! You haven't been raising Cain again?"    "No, no, dad.
 Nothing serious.
 High-spirited Young Patrician  stuff, the sort of thing that's expected of a fellow in my  position.
"    Mr. Crocker was not to be comforted.
    "Jimmy, you've got to pull up.
 Honest, you have.
 I don't care for  myself.
 I like to see a boy having a good time.
 But your  stepmother says you're apt to queer us with the people up top,  the way you're going on.
 Lord knows I wouldn't care if things  were different, but I'll tell you exactly how I stand.
 I didn't  get wise till this morning.
 Your stepmother sprang it on me  suddenly.
 I've often wondered what all this stuff was about, this  living in London and trailing the swells.
 I couldn't think what  was your stepmother's idea.
 Now I know.
 Jimmy, she's trying to  get them to make me a peer!"    "What!"    "Just that.
 And she says--"    "But, dad, this is rich! This is comedy of a high order! A peer!  Good Heavens, if it comes off, what shall I be? This title  business is all so complicated.
 I know I should have to change my  name to Hon.
 Rollo Cholmondeley or the Hon.
 Aubrey Marjoribanks,  but what I want to know is which? I want to be prepared for the  worst.
"    "And you see, Jimmy, these people up top, the guys who arrange  the giving of titles, are keeping an eye on you, because you  would have the title after me and naturally they don't want to  get stung.
 I gathered all that from your stepmother.
 Say, Jimmy,  I'm not asking a lot of you, but there is just one thing you can  do for me without putting yourself out too much.
"    "I'll do it, dad, if it kills me.
 Slip me the info!"    "Your stepmother's friend Lady Corstorphine's nephew .
 .
 .
"    "It's not the sort of story to ask a man with a headache to  follow.
 I hope it gets simpler as it goes along.
"    "Your stepmother wants you to be a good fellow and make friends  with this boy.
 You see, his father is in right with the Premier  and has the biggest kind of a pull when it comes to handing out  titles.
"    "Is that all you want? Leave it to me.
 Inside of a week I'll be  playing kiss-in-the-ring with him.
 The whole force of my sunny  personality shall be directed towards making him love me.
 What's  his name?"    "Lord Percy Whipple.
"    Jimmy's pipe fell with a clatter.
    "Dad, pull yourself together! Reflect! You know you don't  seriously mean Lord Percy Whipple.
"    "Eh?"    Jimmy laid a soothing hand on his father's shoulder.
    "Dad, prepare yourself for the big laugh.
 This is where you throw  your head back and roar with honest mirth.
 I met Lord Percy  Whipple last night at the Six Hundred Club.
 Words ensued.
 I fell  upon Percy and beat his block off! How it started, except that we  both wanted the same table, I couldn't say.
 'Why, that I cannot  tell,' said he, 'but 'twas a famous victory!' If I had known,  dad, nothing would have induced me to lay a hand upon Perce, save  in the way of kindness, but, not even knowing who he was, it  would appear from contemporary accounts of the affair that I just  naturally sailed in and expunged the poor, dear boy!"    The stunning nature of this information had much the same effect  on Mr. Crocker as the announcement of his ruin has upon the Good  Old Man in melodrama.
 He sat clutching the arms of his chair and  staring into space, saying nothing.
 Dismay was written upon his  anguished countenance.
    His collapse sobered Jimmy.
 For the first time he perceived that  the situation had another side than the humorous one which had  appealed to him.
 He had anticipated that Mr. Crocker, who as a  general thing shared his notions of what was funny and could be  relied on to laugh in the right place, would have been struck,  like himself, by the odd and pleasing coincidence of his having  picked on for purposes of assault and battery the one young man  with whom his stepmother wished him to form a firm and lasting  friendship.
 He perceived now that his father was seriously upset.
  Neither Jimmy nor Mr. Crocker possessed a demonstrative nature,  but there had always existed between them the deepest affection.
  Jimmy loved his father as he loved nobody else in the world, and  the thought of having hurt him was like a physical pain.
 His  laughter died away and he set himself with a sinking heart to try  to undo the effect of his words.
    "I'm awfully sorry, dad.
 I had no idea you would care.
 I wouldn't  have done a fool thing like that for a million dollars if I'd  known.
 Isn't there anything I can do? Gee whiz! I'll go right  round to Percy now and apologise.
 I'll lick his boots.
 Don't you  worry, dad.
 I'll make it all right.
"    The whirl of words roused Mr. Crocker from his thoughts.
    "It doesn't matter, Jimmy.
 Don't worry yourself.
 It's only a  little unfortunate, because your stepmother says she won't think  of our going back to America till these people here have given me  a title.
 She wants to put one over on her sister.
 That's all  that's troubling me, the thought that this affair will set us  back, this Lord Percy being in so strong with the guys who give  the titles.
 I guess it will mean my staying on here for a while  longer, and I'd liked to have seen another ball-game.
 Jimmy, do  you know they call baseball Rounders in this country, and  children play it with a soft ball!"    Jimmy was striding up and down the little room.
 Remorse had him  in its grip.
    "What a damned fool I am!"    "Never mind, Jimmy.
 It's unfortunate, but it wasn't your fault.
  You couldn't know.
"    "It was my fault.
 Nobody but a fool like me would go about  beating people up.
 But don't worry, dad.
 It's going to be all  right.
 I'll fix it.
 I'm going right round to this fellow Percy  now to make things all right.
 I won't come back till I've squared  him.
 Don't you bother yourself about it any longer, dad.
 It's  going to be all right.
"            JIMMY ABANDONS PICCADILLY    Jimmy removed himself sorrowfully from the doorstep of the Duke  of Devizes' house in Cleveland Row.
 His mission had been a  failure.
 In answer to his request to be permitted to see Lord  Percy Whipple, the butler had replied that Lord Percy was  confined to his bed and was seeing nobody.
 He eyed Jimmy, on  receiving his name, with an interest which he failed to conceal,  for he too, like Bayliss, had read and heartily enjoyed Bill  Blake's spirited version of the affair of last night which had  appeared in the _Daily Sun_.
 Indeed, he had clipped the report out  and had been engaged in pasting it in an album when the bell  rang.
    In face of this repulse, Jimmy's campaign broke down.
 He was at a  loss to know what to do next.
 He ebbed away from the Duke's front  door like an army that has made an unsuccessful frontal attack on  an impregnable fortress.
 He could hardly force his way in and  search for Lord Percy.
    He walked along Pall Mall, deep in thought.
 It was a beautiful  day.
 The rain which had fallen in the night and relieved Mr.  Crocker from the necessity of watching cricket had freshened  London up.
    The sun was shining now from a turquoise sky.
 A gentle breeze  blew from the south.
 Jimmy made his way into Piccadilly, and  found that thoroughfare a-roar with happy automobilists and  cheery pedestrians.
 Their gaiety irritated him.
 He resented  their apparent enjoyment of life.
    Jimmy's was not a nature that lent itself readily to  introspection, but he was putting himself now through a searching  self-examination which was revealing all kinds of unsuspected  flaws in his character.
 He had been having too good a time for  years past to have leisure to realise that he possessed any  responsibilities.
 He had lived each day as it came in the spirit  of the Monks of Thelema.
 But his father's reception of the news  of last night's escapade and the few words he had said had given  him pause.
 Life had taken on of a sudden a less simple aspect.
  Dimly, for he was not accustomed to thinking along these lines,  he perceived the numbing truth that we human beings are merely as  many pieces in a jig-saw puzzle and that our every movement  affects the fortunes of some other piece.
 Just so, faintly at  first and taking shape by degrees, must the germ of civic spirit  have come to Prehistoric Man.
 We are all individualists till we  wake up.
    The thought of having done anything to make his father unhappy  was bitter to Jimmy Crocker.
 They had always been more like  brothers than father and son.
 Hard thoughts about himself surged  through Jimmy's mind.
 With a dejectedness to which it is possible  that his headache contributed he put the matter squarely to  himself.
 His father was longing to return to America--he, Jimmy,  by his idiotic behaviour was putting obstacles in the way of that  return--what was the answer? The answer, to Jimmy's way of  thinking, was that all was not well with James Crocker, that,  when all the evidence was weighed, James Crocker would appear to  be a fool, a worm, a selfish waster, and a hopeless, low-down  skunk.
    Having come to this conclusion, Jimmy found himself so low in  spirit that the cheerful bustle of Piccadilly was too much for  him.
 He turned, and began to retrace his steps.
 Arriving in due  course at the top of the Haymarket he hesitated, then turned down  it till he reached Cockspur Street.
 Here the Trans-Atlantic  steamship companies have their offices, and so it came about that  Jimmy, chancing to look up as he walked, perceived before him,  riding gallantly on a cardboard ocean behind a plate-glass  window, the model of a noble vessel.
 He stopped, conscious of a  curious thrill.
 There is a superstition in all of us.
 When an  accidental happening chances to fit smoothly in with a mood,  seeming to come as a direct commentary on that mood, we are apt  to accept it in defiance of our pure reason as an omen.
 Jimmy  strode to the window and inspected the model narrowly.
 The sight  of it had started a new train of thought.
 His heart began to  race.
 Hypnotic influences were at work on him.
    Why not? Could there be a simpler solution of the whole trouble?    Inside the office he would see a man with whiskers buying a  ticket for New York.
 The simplicity of the process fascinated  him.
 All you had to do was to walk in, bend over the counter  while the clerk behind it made dabs with a pencil at the  illustrated plate of the ship's interior organs, and hand over  your money.
 A child could do it, if in funds.
 At this thought his  hand strayed to his trouser-pocket.
 A musical crackling of  bank-notes proceeded from the depths.
 His quarterly allowance had  been paid to him only a short while before, and, though a willing  spender, he still retained a goodly portion of it.
 He rustled the  notes again.
 There was enough in that pocket to buy three tickets  to New York.
 Should he? .
 .
 .
 Or, on the other hand--always look  on both sides of the question--should he not?    It would certainly seem to be the best thing for all parties if  he did follow the impulse.
 By remaining in London he was injuring  everybody, himself included.
 .
 .
 .
 Well, there was no harm in  making enquiries.
 Probably the boat was full up anyway.
 .
 .
 .
 He  walked into the office.
    "Have you anything left on the _Atlantic_ this trip?"    The clerk behind the counter was quite the wrong sort of person  for Jimmy to have had dealings with in his present mood.
 What  Jimmy needed was a grave, sensible man who would have laid a hand  on his shoulder and said "Do nothing rash, my boy!" The clerk  fell short of this ideal in practically every particular.
 He was  about twenty-two, and he seemed perfectly enthusiastic about the  idea of Jimmy going to America.
 He beamed at Jimmy.
    "Plenty of room," he said.
 "Very few people crossing.
 Give you  excellent accommodation.
"    "When does the boat sail?"    "Eight to-morrow morning from Liverpool.
 Boat-train leaves  Paddington six to-night.
"    Prudence came at the eleventh hour to check Jimmy.
 This was not a  matter, he perceived, to be decided recklessly, on the spur of a  sudden impulse.
 Above all, it was not a matter to be decided  before lunch.
 An empty stomach breeds imagination.
 He had  ascertained that he could sail on the _Atlantic_ if he wished to.
  The sensible thing to do now was to go and lunch and see how he  felt about it after that.
 He thanked the clerk, and started to  walk up the Haymarket, feeling hard-headed and practical, yet  with a strong premonition that he was going to make a fool of  himself just the same.
    It was half-way up the Haymarket that he first became conscious  of the girl with the red hair.
    Plunged in thought, he had not noticed her before.
 And yet she  had been walking a few paces in front of him most of the way.
 She  had come out of Panton Street, walking briskly, as one going to  keep a pleasant appointment.
 She carried herself admirably, with  a jaunty swing.
    Having become conscious of this girl, Jimmy, ever a warm admirer  of the sex, began to feel a certain interest stealing over him.
  With interest came speculation.
 He wondered who she was.
 He  wondered where she had bought that excellently fitting suit of  tailor-made grey.
 He admired her back, and wondered whether her  face, if seen, would prove a disappointment.
 Thus musing, he drew  near to the top of the Haymarket, where it ceases to be a street  and becomes a whirlpool of rushing traffic.
 And here the girl,  having paused and looked over her shoulder, stepped off the  sidewalk.
 As she did so a taxi-cab rounded the corner quickly  from the direction of Coventry Street.
    The agreeable surprise of finding the girl's face fully as  attractive as her back had stimulated Jimmy, so that he was keyed  up for the exhibition of swift presence-of-mind.
 He jumped  forward and caught her arm, and swung her to one side as the cab  rattled past, its driver thinking hard thoughts to himself.
 The  whole episode was an affair of seconds.
    "Thank you," said the girl.
    She rubbed the arm which he had seized with rather a rueful  expression.
 She was a little white, and her breath came quickly.
    "I hope I didn't hurt you," said Jimmy.
    "You did.
 Very much.
 But the taxi would have hurt me more.
"    She laughed.
 She looked very attractive when she laughed.
 She had  a small, piquant, vivacious face.
 Jimmy, as he looked at it, had  an odd feeling that he had seen her before--when and where he did  not know.
 That mass of red-gold hair seemed curiously familiar.
  Somewhere in the hinterland of his mind there lurked a memory,  but he could not bring it into the open.
 As for the girl, if she  had ever met him before, she showed no signs of recollecting it.
  Jimmy decided that, if he had seen her, it must have been in his  reporter days.
 She was plainly an American, and he occasionally  had the feeling that he had seen every one in America when he had  worked for the _Chronicle_.
    "That's right," he said approvingly.
 "Always look on the bright  side.
"    "I only arrived in London yesterday," said the girl, "and I  haven't got used to your keeping-to-the-left rules.
 I don't  suppose I shall ever get back to New York alive.
 Perhaps, as you  have saved my life, you wouldn't mind doing me another service.
  Can you tell me which is the nearest and safest way to a  restaurant called the Regent Grill?"    "It's just over there, at the corner of Regent Street.
 As to the  safest way, if I were you I should cross over at the top of the  street there and then work round westward.
 Otherwise you will have  to cross Piccadilly Circus.
"    "I absolutely refuse even to try to cross Piccadilly Circus.
  Thank you very much.
 I will follow your advice.
 I hope I shall  get there.
 It doesn't seem at all likely.
"    She gave him a little nod, and moved away.
 Jimmy turned into that  drug-store at the top of the Haymarket at which so many Londoners  have found healing and comfort on the morning after, and bought  the pink drink for which his system had been craving since he  rose from bed.
 He wondered why, as he drained it, he should feel  ashamed and guilty.
    A few minutes later he found himself, with mild surprise, going  down the steps of the Regent Grill.
 It was the last place he had  had in his mind when he had left the steamship company's offices  in quest of lunch.
 He had intended to seek out some quiet,  restful nook where he could be alone with his thoughts.
 If  anybody had told him then that five minutes later he would be  placing himself of his own free will within the range of a  restaurant orchestra playing "My Little Grey Home in the  West"--and the orchestra at the Regent played little else--he  would not have believed him.
    Restaurants in all large cities have their ups and downs.
 At this  time the Regent Grill was enjoying one of those bursts of  popularity for which restaurateurs pray to whatever strange gods  they worship.
 The more prosperous section of London's Bohemia  flocked to it daily.
 When Jimmy had deposited his hat with the  robber-band who had their cave just inside the main entrance and  had entered the grill-room, he found it congested.
 There did not  appear to be a single unoccupied table.
    From where he stood he could see the girl of the red-gold hair.
  Her back was towards him, and she was sitting at a table against  one of the pillars with a little man with eye-glasses, a handsome  woman in the forties, and a small stout boy who was skirmishing  with the olives.
 As Jimmy hesitated, the vigilant head-waiter,  who knew him well, perceived him, and hurried up.
    "In one moment, Mister Crockaire!" he said, and began to scatter  commands among the underlings.
 "I will place a table for you in  the aisle.
"    "Next to that pillar, please," said Jimmy.
    The underlings had produced a small table--apparently from up  their sleeves, and were draping it in a cloth.
 Jimmy sat down and  gave his order.
 Ordering was going on at the other table.
 The  little man seemed depressed at the discovery that corn on the cob  and soft-shelled crabs were not to be obtained, and his wife's  reception of the news that clams were not included in the  Regent's bill-of-fare was so indignant that one would have said  that she regarded the fact as evidence that Great Britain was  going to pieces and would shortly lose her place as a world  power.
    A selection having finally been agreed upon, the orchestra struck  up "My Little Grey Home in the West," and no attempt was made to  compete with it.
 When the last lingering strains had died away  and the violinist-leader, having straightened out the kinks in  his person which the rendition of the melody never failed to  produce, had bowed for the last time, a clear, musical voice  spoke from the other side of the pillar.
    "Jimmy Crocker is a WORM!"    Jimmy spilled his cocktail.
 It might have been the voice of  Conscience.
    "I despise him more than any one on earth.
 I hate to think that  he's an American.
"    Jimmy drank the few drops that remained in his glass, partly to  make sure of them, partly as a restorative.
 It is an unnerving  thing to be despised by a red-haired girl whose life you have  just saved.
 To Jimmy it was not only unnerving; it was uncanny.
  This girl had not known him when they met on the street a few  moments before.
 How then was she able to display such intimate  acquaintance with his character now as to describe him--justly  enough--as a worm? Mingled with the mystery of the thing was its  pathos.
 The thought that a girl could be as pretty as this one  and yet dislike him so much was one of the saddest things Jimmy  had ever come across.
 It was like one of those Things Which Make  Me Weep In This Great City so dear to the hearts of the  sob-writers of his late newspaper.
    A waiter bustled up with a high-ball.
 Jimmy thanked him with his  eyes.
 He needed it.
 He raised it to his lips.
    "He's always drinking--"    He set it down hurriedly.
    "--and making a disgraceful exhibition of himself in public! I  always think Jimmy Crocker--"    Jimmy began to wish that somebody would stop this girl.
 Why  couldn't the little man change the subject to the weather, or  that stout child start prattling about some general topic? Surely  a boy of that age, newly arrived in London, must have all sorts  of things to prattle about? But the little man was dealing  strenuously with a breaded cutlet, while the stout boy, grimly  silent, surrounded fish-pie in the forthright manner of a  starving python.
 As for the elder woman, she seemed to be  wrestling with unpleasant thoughts, beyond speech.
    "--I always think that Jimmy Crocker is the worst case I know of  the kind of American young man who spends all his time in Europe  and tries to become an imitation Englishman.
 Most of them are the  sort any country would be glad to get rid of, but he used to work  once, so you can't excuse him on the ground that he hasn't the  sense to know what he's doing.
 He's deliberately chosen to loaf  about London and make a pest of himself.
 He went to pieces with  his eyes open.
 He's a perfect, utter, hopeless WORM!"    Jimmy had never been very fond of the orchestra at the Regent  Grill, holding the view that it interfered with conversation and  made for an unhygienic rapidity of mastication; but he was  profoundly grateful to it now for bursting suddenly into _La  Boheme_, the loudest item in its repertory.
 Under cover of that  protective din he was able to toy with a steaming dish which his  waiter had brought.
 Probably that girl was saying all sorts of  things about him still but he could not hear them.
    The music died away.
 For a moment the tortured air quivered in  comparative silence; then the girl's voice spoke again.
 She had,  however, selected another topic of conversation.
    "I've seen all I want to of England," she said, "I've seen  Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament and His Majesty's  Theatre and the Savoy and the Cheshire Cheese, and I've developed  a frightful home-sickness.
 Why shouldn't we go back to-morrow?"    For the first time in the proceedings the elder woman spoke.
 She  cast aside her mantle of gloom long enough to say "Yes," then  wrapped it round her again.
 The little man, who had apparently  been waiting for her vote before giving his own, said that the  sooner he was on board a New York-bound boat the better he would  be pleased.
 The stout boy said nothing.
 He had finished his  fish-pie, and was now attacking jam roll with a sort of morose  resolution.
    "There's certain to be a boat," said the girl.
 "There always is.
  You've got to say that for England--it's an easy place to get back  to America from.
" She paused.
 "What I can't understand is how,  after having been in America and knowing what it was like, Jimmy  Crocker could stand living .
 .
 .
"    The waiter had come to Jimmy's side, bearing cheese; but Jimmy  looked at it with dislike and shook his head in silent negation.
  He was about to depart from this place.
 His capacity for  absorbing home-truths about himself was exhausted.
 He placed a  noiseless sovereign on the table, caught the waiter's eye,  registered renunciation, and departed soft-footed down the aisle.
  The waiter, a man who had never been able to bring himself to  believe in miracles, revised the views of a life-time.
 He looked  at the sovereign, then at Jimmy, then at the sovereign again.
  Then he took up the coin and bit it furtively.
    A few minutes later, a hat-check boy, untipped for the first time  in his predatory career, was staring at Jimmy with equal  intensity, but with far different feelings.
 Speechless concern  was limned on his young face.
    The commissionaire at the Piccadilly entrance of the restaurant  touched his hat ingratiatingly, with the smug confidence of a man  who is accustomed to getting sixpence a time for doing it.
    "Taxi, Mr. Crocker?"    "A worm," said Jimmy.
    "Beg pardon, sir?"    "Always drinking," explained Jimmy, "and making a pest of  himself.
"    He passed on.
 The commissionaire stared after him as intently as  the waiter and the hat-check boy.
 He had sometimes known Mr.  Crocker like this after supper, but never before during the  luncheon hour.
    Jimmy made his way to his club in Northumberland Avenue.
 For  perhaps half an hour he sat in a condition of coma in the  smoking-room; then, his mind made up, he went to one of the  writing-tables.
 He sat awaiting inspiration for some minutes,  then began to write.
    The letter he wrote was to his father:      Dear Dad:    I have been thinking over what we talked about this  morning, and it seems to me the best thing I can do is to  drop out of sight for a brief space.
 If I stay on in  London, I am likely at any moment to pull some boner like  last night's which will spill the beans for you once more.
  The least I can do for you is to give you a clear field  and not interfere, so I am off to New York by to-night's  boat.
    I went round to Percy's to try to grovel in the dust  before him, but he wouldn't see me.
 It's no good  grovelling in the dust of the front steps for the benefit  of a man who's in bed on the second floor, so I withdrew  in more or less good order.
 I then got the present idea.
  Mark how all things work together for good.
 When they come  to you and say "No title for you.
 Your son slugged our pal  Percy," all you have to do is to come back at them with "I  know my son slugged Percy, and believe me I didn't do a  thing to him! I packed him off to America within  twenty-four hours.
 Get me right, boys! I'm anti-Jimmy and  pro-Percy.
" To which their reply will be "Oh, well, in  that case arise, Lord Crocker!" or whatever they say when  slipping a title to a deserving guy.
 So you will see that  by making this getaway I am doing the best I can to put  things straight.
 I shall give this to Bayliss to give to  you.
 I am going to call him up on the phone in a minute to  have him pack a few simple tooth-brushes and so on for me.
  On landing in New York, I shall instantly proceed to the  Polo Grounds to watch a game of Rounders, and will cable  you the full score.
 Well.
 I think that's about all.
 So  good-bye--or even farewell--for the present.
    J.
    P.
S.
 I know you'll understand, dad.
 I'm doing what seems  to me the only possible thing.
 Don't worry about me.
 I  shall be all right.
 I'll get back my old job and be a  terrific success all round.
 You go ahead and get that  title and then meet me at the entrance of the Polo  Grounds.
 I'll be looking for you.
    P.
P.
S.
 I'm a worm.
      The young clerk at the steamship offices appeared rejoiced to see  Jimmy once more.
 With a sunny smile he snatched a pencil from his  ear and plunged it into the vitals of the Atlantic.
    "How about E.
 a hundred and eight?"    "Suits me.
"    "You're too late to go in the passenger-list, of course.
"    Jimmy did not reply.
 He was gazing rigidly at a girl who had just  come in, a girl with red hair and a friendly smile.
    "So you're sailing on the _Atlantic_, too!" she said, with a glance  at the chart on the counter.
 "How odd! We have just decided to go  back on her too.
 There's nothing to keep us here and we're all  homesick.
 Well, you see I wasn't run over after I left you.
"    A delicious understanding relieved Jimmy's swimming brain, as  thunder relieves the tense and straining air.
 The feeling that he  was going mad left him, as the simple solution of his mystery  came to him.
 This girl must have heard of him in New  York--perhaps she knew people whom he knew and it was on hearsay,  not on personal acquaintance, that she based that dislike of him  which she had expressed with such freedom and conviction so short  a while before at the Regent Grill.
 She did not know who he was!    Into this soothing stream of thought cut the voice of the clerk.
    "What name, please?"    Jimmy's mind rocked again.
 Why were these things happening to him  to-day of all days, when he needed the tenderest treatment, when  he had a headache already?    The clerk was eyeing him expectantly.
 He had laid down his pencil  and was holding aloft a pen.
 Jimmy gulped.
 Every name in the  English language had passed from his mind.
 And then from out of  the dark came inspiration.
    "Bayliss," he croaked.
    The girl held out her hand.
    "Then we can introduce ourselves at last.
 My name is Ann Chester.
  How do you do, Mr. Bayliss?"    "How do you do, Miss Chester?"    The clerk had finished writing the ticket, and was pressing  labels and a pink paper on him.
 The paper, he gathered dully, was  a form and had to be filled up.
 He examined it, and found it to  be a searching document.
 Some of its questions could be answered  off-hand, others required thought.
    "Height?" Simple.
 Five foot eleven.
    "Hair?" Simple.
 Brown.
    "Eyes?" Simple again.
 Blue.
    Next, queries of a more offensive kind.
    "Are you a polygamist?"    He could answer that.
 Decidedly no.
 One wife would be  ample--provided she had red-gold hair, brown-gold eyes, the right  kind of mouth, and a dimple.
 Whatever doubts there might be in  his mind on other points, on that one he had none whatever.
    "Have you ever been in prison?"    Not yet.
    And then a very difficult one.
 "Are you a lunatic?"    Jimmy hesitated.
 The ink dried on his pen.
 He was wondering.
                                      In the dim cavern of Paddington Station the boat-train snorted  impatiently, varying the process with an occasional sharp shriek.
  The hands of the station clock pointed to ten minutes to six.
 The  platform was a confused mass of travellers, porters, baggage,  trucks, boys with buns and fruits, boys with magazines, friends,  relatives, and Bayliss the butler, standing like a faithful  watchdog beside a large suitcase.
 To the human surf that broke  and swirled about him he paid no attention.
 He was looking for  the young master.
    Jimmy clove the crowd like a one-man flying-wedge.
 Two fruit and  bun boys who impeded his passage drifted away like leaves on an  Autumn gale.
    "Good man!" He possessed himself of the suitcase.
 "I was afraid  you might not be able to get here.
"    "The mistress is dining out, Mr. James.
 I was able to leave the  house.
"    "Have you packed everything I shall want?"    "Within the scope of a suitcase, yes, sir.
"    "Splendid! Oh, by the way, give this letter to my father, will  you?"    "Very good, sir.
"    "I'm glad you were able to manage.
 I thought your voice sounded  doubtful over the phone.
"    "I was a good deal taken aback, Mr. James.
 Your decision to leave  was so extremely sudden.
"    "So was Columbus'.
 You know about him? He saw an egg standing on  its head and whizzed off like a jack-rabbit.
"    "If you will pardon the liberty, Mr. James, is it not a little  rash--?"    "Don't take the joy out of life, Bayliss.
 I may be a chump, but  try to forget it.
 Use your willpower.
"    "Good evening, Mr. Bayliss," said a voice behind them.
 They both  turned.
 The butler was gazing rather coyly at a vision in a grey  tailor-made suit.
    "Good evening, miss," he said doubtfully.
    Ann looked at him in astonishment, then broke into a smile.
    "How stupid of me! I meant this Mr. Bayliss.
 Your son! We met at  the steamship offices.
 And before that he saved my life.
 So we  are old friends.
"    Bayliss, gaping perplexedly and feeling unequal to the  intellectual pressure of the conversation, was surprised further  to perceive a warning scowl on the face of his Mr. James.
 Jimmy  had not foreseen this thing, but he had a quick mind and was  equal to it.
    "How are you, Miss Chester? My father has come down to see me  off.
 This is Miss Chester, dad.
"    A British butler is not easily robbed of his poise, but Bayliss  was frankly unequal to the sudden demand on his presence of mind.
  He lowered his jaw an inch or two, but spoke no word.
    "Dad's a little upset at my going," whispered Jimmy  confidentially.
 "He's not quite himself.
"    Ann was a girl possessed not only of ready tact but of a kind  heart.
 She had summed up Mr. Bayliss at a glance.
 Every line of  him proclaimed him a respectable upper servant.
 No girl on earth  could have been freer than she of snobbish prejudice, but she  could not check a slight thrill of surprise and disappointment at  the discovery of Jimmy's humble origin.
 She understood everything,  and there were tears in her eyes as she turned away to avoid  intruding on the last moments of the parting of father and son.
    "I'll see you on the boat, Mr. Bayliss," she said.
    "Eh?" said Bayliss.
    "Yes, yes," said Jimmy.
 "Good-bye till then.
"    Ann walked on to her compartment.
 She felt as if she had just read  a whole long novel, one of those chunky younger-English-novelist  things.
 She knew the whole story as well as if it had been told  to her in detail.
 She could see the father, the honest steady  butler, living his life with but one aim, to make a gentleman of  his beloved only son.
 Year by year he had saved.
 Probably he had  sent the son to college.
 And now, with a father's blessing and  the remains of a father's savings, the boy was setting out for  the New World, where dollar-bills grew on trees and no one asked  or cared who any one else's father might be.
    There was a lump in her throat.
 Bayliss would have been amazed if  he could have known what a figure of pathetic fineness he seemed  to her.
 And then her thoughts turned to Jimmy, and she was aware  of a glow of kindliness towards him.
 His father had succeeded in  his life's ambition.
 He had produced a gentleman! How easily and  simply, without a trace of snobbish shame, the young man had  introduced his father.
 There was the right stuff in him.
 He was  not ashamed of the humble man who had given him his chance in  life.
 She found herself liking Jimmy amazingly .
 .
 .
    The hands of the clock pointed to three minutes to the hour.
  Porters skimmed to and fro like water-beetles.
    "I can't explain," said Jimmy.
 "It wasn't temporary insanity; it  was necessity.
"    "Very good, Mr. James.
 I think you had better be taking your seat  now.
"    "Quite right, I had.
 It would spoil the whole thing if they left  me behind.
 Bayliss, did you ever see such eyes? Such hair! Look  after my father while I am away.
 Don't let the dukes worry him.
  Oh, and, Bayliss"--Jimmy drew his hand from his pocket--"as one  pal to another--"    Bayliss looked at the crackling piece of paper.
    "I couldn't, Mr. James, I really couldn't! A five-pound note! I  couldn't!"    "Nonsense! Be a sport!"    "Begging your pardon, Mr. James, I really couldn't.
 You cannot  afford to throw away your money like this.
 You cannot have a  great deal of it, if you will excuse me for saying so.
"    "I won't do anything of the sort.
 Grab it! Oh, Lord, the train's  starting! Good-bye, Bayliss!"    The engine gave a final shriek of farewell.
 The train began to  slide along the platform, pursued to the last by optimistic boys  offering buns for sale.
 It gathered speed.
 Jimmy, leaning out the  window, was amazed at a spectacle so unusual as practically to  amount to a modern miracle--the spectacled Bayliss running.
 The  butler was not in the pink of condition, but he was striding out  gallantly.
 He reached the door of Jimmy's compartment, and raised  his hand.
    "Begging your pardon, Mr. James," he panted, "for taking the  liberty, but I really couldn't!"    He reached up and thrust something into Jimmy's hand, something  crisp and crackling.
 Then, his mission performed, fell back and  stood waving a snowy handkerchief.
 The train plunged into the  tunnel.
    Jimmy stared at the five-pound note.
 He was aware, like Ann  farther along the train, of a lump in his throat.
 He put the note  slowly into his pocket.
    The train moved on.
            ON THE BOAT-DECK    Rising waters and a fine flying scud that whipped stingingly over  the side had driven most of the passengers on the _Atlantic_ to the  shelter of their staterooms or to the warm stuffiness of the  library.
 It was the fifth evening of the voyage.
 For five days  and four nights the ship had been racing through a placid ocean  on her way to Sandy Hook: but in the early hours of this  afternoon the wind had shifted to the north, bringing heavy seas.
  Darkness had begun to fall now.
 The sky was a sullen black.
 The  white crests of the rollers gleamed faintly in the dusk, and the  wind sang in the ropes.
    Jimmy and Ann had had the boat-deck to themselves for half an  hour.
 Jimmy was a good sailor: it exhilarated him to fight the  wind and to walk a deck that heaved and dipped and shuddered  beneath his feet; but he had not expected to have Ann's company  on such an evening.
 But she had come out of the saloon entrance,  her small face framed in a hood and her slim body shapeless  beneath a great cloak, and joined him in his walk.
    Jimmy was in a mood of exaltation.
 He had passed the last few  days in a condition of intermittent melancholy, consequent on the  discovery that he was not the only man on board the _Atlantic_ who  desired the society of Ann as an alleviation of the tedium of an  ocean voyage.
 The world, when he embarked on this venture, had  consisted so exclusively of Ann and himself that, until the ship  was well on its way to Queenstown, he had not conceived the  possibility of intrusive males forcing their unwelcome attentions  on her.
 And it had added bitterness to the bitter awakening that  their attentions did not appear to be at all unwelcome.
 Almost  immediately after breakfast on the very first day, a creature with  a small black moustache and shining teeth had descended upon Ann  and, vocal with surprise and pleasure at meeting her again--he  claimed, damn him!, to have met her before at Palm Beach, Bar  Harbor, and a dozen other places--had carried her off to play an  idiotic game known as shuffle-board.
 Nor was this an isolated  case.
 It began to be borne in upon Jimmy that Ann, whom he had  looked upon purely in the light of an Eve playing opposite his  Adam in an exclusive Garden of Eden, was an extremely well-known  and popular character.
 The clerk at the shipping-office had lied  absurdly when he had said that very few people were crossing on  the _Atlantic_ this voyage.
 The vessel was crammed till its sides  bulged, it was loaded down in utter defiance of the Plimsoll law,  with Rollos and Clarences and Dwights and Twombleys who had known  and golfed and ridden and driven and motored and swum and danced  with Ann for years.
 A ghastly being entitled Edgar Something or  Teddy Something had beaten Jimmy by a short head in the race for  the deck-steward, the prize of which was the placing of his  deck-chair next to Ann's.
 Jimmy had been driven from the  promenade deck by the spectacle of this beastly creature lying  swathed in rugs reading best-sellers to her.
    He had scarcely seen her to speak to since the beginning of the  voyage.
 When she was not walking with Rolly or playing  shuffle-board with Twombley, she was down below ministering to  the comfort of a chronically sea-sick aunt, referred to in  conversation as "poor aunt Nesta".
 Sometimes Jimmy saw the little  man--presumably her uncle--in the smoking-room, and once he came  upon the stout boy recovering from the effects of a cigar in a  quiet corner of the boat-deck: but apart from these meetings the  family was as distant from him as if he had never seen Ann at  all--let alone saved her life.
    And now she had dropped down on him from heaven.
 They were alone  together with the good clean wind and the bracing scud.
 Rollo,  Clarence, Dwight, and Twombley, not to mention Edgar or possibly  Teddy, were down below--he hoped, dying.
 They had the world to  themselves.
    "I love rough weather," said Ann, lifting her face to the wind.
  Her eyes were very bright.
 She was beyond any doubt or question  the only girl on earth.
 "Poor aunt Nesta doesn't.
 She was bad  enough when it was quite calm, but this storm has finished her.
  I've just been down below, trying to cheer her up.
"    Jimmy thrilled at the picture.
 Always fascinating, Ann seemed to  him at her best in the role of ministering angel.
 He longed to  tell her so, but found no words.
 They reached the end of the  deck, and turned.
 Ann looked up at him.
    "I've hardly seen anything of you since we sailed," she said.
 She  spoke almost reproachfully.
 "Tell me all about yourself, Mr.  Bayliss.
 Why are you going to America?"    Jimmy had had an impassioned indictment of the Rollos on his  tongue, but she had closed the opening for it as quickly as she  had made it.
 In face of her direct demand for information he  could not hark back to it now.
 After all, what did the Rollos  matter? They had no part in this little wind-swept world: they  were where they belonged, in some nether hell on the C.
 or D.
  deck, moaning for death.
    "To make a fortune, I hope," he said.
    Ann was pleased at this confirmation of her diagnosis.
 She had  deduced this from the evidence at Paddington Station.
    "How pleased your father will be if you do!"    The slight complexity of Jimmy's affairs caused him to pause for  a moment to sort out his fathers, but an instant's reflection  told him that she must be referring to Bayliss the butler.
    "Yes.
"    "He's a dear old man," said Ann.
 "I suppose he's very proud of  you?"    "I hope so.
"    "You must do tremendously well in America, so as not to  disappoint him.
 What are you thinking of doing?"    Jimmy considered for a moment.
    "Newspaper work, I think.
"    "Oh? Why, have you had any experience?"    "A little.
"    Ann seemed to grow a little aloof, as if her enthusiasm had been  damped.
    "Oh, well, I suppose it's a good enough profession.
 I'm not very  fond of it myself.
 I've only met one newspaper man in my life,  and I dislike him very much, so I suppose that has prejudiced  me.
"    "Who was that?"    "You wouldn't have met him.
 He was on an American paper.
 A man  named Crocker.
"    A sudden gust of wind drove them back a step, rendering talk  impossible.
 It covered a gap when Jimmy could not have spoken.
  The shock of the information that Ann had met him before made him  dumb.
 This thing was beyond him.
 It baffled him.
    Her next words supplied a solution.
 They were under shelter of  one of the boats now and she could make herself heard.
    "It was five years ago, and I only met him for a very short  while, but the prejudice has lasted.
"    Jimmy began to understand.
 Five years ago! It was not so strange,  then, that they should not recognise each other now.
 He stirred  up his memory.
 Nothing came to the surface.
 Not a gleam of  recollection of that early meeting rewarded him.
 And yet  something of importance must have happened then, for her to  remember it.
 Surely his mere personality could not have been so  unpleasant as to have made such a lasting impression on her!    "I wish you could do something better than newspaper work," said  Ann.
 "I always think the splendid part about America is that it  is such a land of adventure.
 There are such millions of chances.
  It's a place where anything may happen.
 Haven't you an  adventurous soul, Mr. Bayliss?"    No man lightly submits to a charge, even a hinted charge, of  being deficient in the capacity for adventure.
    "Of course I have," said Jimmy indignantly.
 "I'm game to tackle  anything that comes along.
"    "I'm glad of that.
"    Her feeling of comradeship towards this young man deepened.
 She  loved adventure and based her estimate of any member of the  opposite sex largely on his capacity for it.
 She moved in a set,  when at home, which was more polite than adventurous, and had  frequently found the atmosphere enervating.
    "Adventure," said Jimmy, "is everything.
"    He paused.
 "Or a good deal," he concluded weakly.
    "Why qualify it like that? It sounds so tame.
 Adventure is the  biggest thing in life.
"    It seemed to Jimmy that he had received an excuse for a remark of  a kind that had been waiting for utterance ever since he had met  her.
 Often and often in the watches of the night, smoking endless  pipes and thinking of her, he had conjured up just such a vision  as this--they two walking the deserted deck alone, and she  innocently giving him an opening for some low-voiced, tender  speech, at which she would start, look at him quickly, and then  ask him haltingly if the words had any particular application.
  And after that--oh, well, all sorts of things might happen.
 And  now the moment had come.
 It was true that he had always pictured  the scene as taking place by moonlight and at present there was a  half-gale blowing, out of an inky sky; also on the present  occasion anything in the nature of a low-voiced speech was  absolutely out of the question owing to the uproar of the  elements.
 Still, taking these drawbacks into consideration, the  chance was far too good to miss.
 Such an opening might never  happen again.
 He waited till the ship had steadied herself after  an apparently suicidal dive into an enormous roller, then,  staggering back to her side, spoke.
    "Love is the biggest thing in life!" he roared.
    "What is?" shrieked Ann.
    "Love!" bellowed Jimmy.
    He wished a moment later that he had postponed this statement of  faith, for their next steps took them into a haven of comparative  calm, where some dimly seen portion of the vessel's anatomy  jutted out and formed a kind of nook where it was possible to  hear the ordinary tones of the human voice.
 He halted here, and  Ann did the same, though unwillingly.
 She was conscious of a  feeling of disappointment and of a modification of her mood of  comradeship towards her companion.
 She held strong views, which  she believed to be unalterable, on the subject under discussion.
    "Love!" she said.
 It was too dark to see her face, but her voice  sounded unpleasantly scornful.
 "I shouldn't have thought that you  would have been so conventional as that.
 You seemed different.
"    "Eh?" said Jimmy blankly.
    "I hate all this talk about Love, as if it were something  wonderful that was worth everything else in life put together.
  Every book you read and every song that you see in the  shop-windows is all about Love.
 It's as if the whole world were  in a conspiracy to persuade themselves that there's a wonderful  something just round the corner which they can get if they try  hard enough.
 And they hypnotise themselves into thinking of  nothing else and miss all the splendid things of life.
"    "That's Shaw, isn't it?" said Jimmy.
    "What is Shaw?"    "What you were saying.
 It's out of one of Bernard Shaw's things,  isn't it?"    "It is not.
" A note of acidity had crept into Ann's voice.
 "It is  perfectly original.
"    "I'm certain I've heard it before somewhere.
"    "If you have, that simply means that you must have associated  with some sensible person.
"    Jimmy was puzzled.
    "But why the grouch?" he asked.
    "I don't understand you.
"    "I mean, why do you feel that way about it?"    Ann was quite certain now that she did not like this young man  nearly as well as she had supposed.
 It is trying for a  strong-minded, clear-thinking girl to have her philosophy  described as a grouch.
    "Because I've had the courage to think about it for myself, and  not let myself be blinded by popular superstition.
 The whole  world has united in making itself imagine that there is something  called love which is the most wonderful happening in life.
 The  poets and novelists have simply hounded them on to believe it.
  It's a gigantic swindle.
"    A wave of tender compassion swept over Jimmy.
 He understood it  all now.
 Naturally a girl who had associated all her life with  the Rollos, Clarences, Dwights, and Twombleys would come to  despair of the possibility of falling in love with any one.
    "You haven't met the right man," he said.
 She had, of course, but  only recently: and, anyway, he could point that out later.
    "There is no such thing as the right man," said Ann resolutely,  "if you are suggesting that there is a type of man in existence  who is capable of inspiring what is called romantic love.
 I  believe in marriage.
 .
 .
 .
"    "Good work!" said Jimmy, well satisfied.
    " .
 .
 .
 But not as the result of a sort of delirium.
 I believe in  it as a sensible partnership between two friends who know each  other well and trust each other.
 The right way of looking at  marriage is to realise, first of all, that there are no thrills,  no romances, and then to pick out some one who is nice and kind  and amusing and full of life and willing to do things to make you  happy.
"    "Ah!" said Jimmy, straightening his tie, "Well, that's  something.
"    "How do you mean--that's something? Are you shocked at my views?"    "I don't believe they are your views.
 You've been reading one of  these stern, soured fellows who analyse things.
"    Ann stamped.
 The sound was inaudible, but Jimmy noticed the  movement.
    "Cold?" he said.
 "Let's walk on.
"    Ann's sense of humour reasserted itself.
 It was not often that it  remained dormant for so long.
 She laughed.
    "I know exactly what you are thinking," she said.
 "You believe  that I am posing, that those aren't my real opinions.
"    "They can't be.
 But I don't think you are posing.
 It's getting on  for dinner-time, and you've got that wan, sinking feeling that  makes you look upon the world and find it a hollow fraud.
 The  bugle will be blowing in a few minutes, and half an hour after  that you will be yourself again.
"    "I'm myself now.
 I suppose you can't realise that a pretty girl  can hold such views.
"    Jimmy took her arm.
    "Let me help you," he said.
 "There's a knothole in the deck.
  Watch your step.
 Now, listen to me.
 I'm glad you've brought up  this subject--I mean the subject of your being the prettiest girl  in the known world--"    "I never said that.
"    "Your modesty prevented you.
 But it's a fact, nevertheless.
 I'm  glad, I say, because I have been thinking a lot along those lines  myself, and I have been anxious to discuss the point with you.
  You have the most glorious hair I have ever seen!"    "Do you like red hair?"    "Red-gold.
"    "It is nice of you to put it like that.
 When I was a child all  except a few of the other children called me Carrots.
"    "They have undoubtedly come to a bad end by this time.
 If bears  were sent to attend to the children who criticised Elijah, your  little friends were in line for a troupe of tigers.
 But there  were some of a finer fibre? There were a few who didn't call you  Carrots?"    "One or two.
 They called me Brick-Top.
"    "They have probably been electrocuted since.
 Your eyes are  perfectly wonderful!"    Ann withdrew her arm.
 An extensive acquaintance of young men told  her that the topic of conversation was now due to be changed.
    "You will like America," she said.
    "We are not discussing America.
"    "I am.
 It is a wonderful country for a man who wants to succeed.
  If I were you, I should go out West.
"    "Do you live out West?"    "No.
"    "Then why suggest my going there? Where do you live?"    "I live in New York.
"    "I shall stay in New York, then.
"    Ann was wary, but amused.
 Proposals of marriage--and Jimmy seemed  to be moving swiftly towards one--were no novelty in her life.
 In  the course of several seasons at Bar Harbor, Tuxedo, Palm Beach,  and in New York itself, she had spent much of her time foiling  and discouraging the ardour of a series of sentimental youths who  had laid their unwelcome hearts at her feet.
    "New York is open for staying in about this time, I believe.
"    Jimmy was silent.
 He had done his best to fight a tendency to  become depressed and had striven by means of a light tone to keep  himself resolutely cheerful, but the girl's apparently total  indifference to him was too much for his spirits.
 One of the  young men who had had to pick up the heart he had flung at Ann's  feet and carry it away for repairs had once confided to an  intimate friend, after the sting had to some extent passed, that  the feelings of a man who made love to Ann might be likened to  the emotions which hot chocolate might be supposed to entertain  on contact with vanilla ice-cream.
 Jimmy, had the comparison been  presented to him, would have endorsed its perfect accuracy.
 The  wind from the sea, until now keen and bracing, had become merely  infernally cold.
 The song of the wind in the rigging, erstwhile  melodious, had turned into a damned depressing howling.
    "I used to be as sentimental as any one a few years ago," said  Ann, returning to the dropped subject.
 "Just after I left  college, I was quite maudlin.
 I dreamed of moons and Junes and  loves and doves all the time.
 Then something happened which made  me see what a little fool I was.
 It wasn't pleasant at the time,  but it had a very bracing effect.
 I have been quite different  ever since.
 It was a man, of course, who did it.
 His method was  quite simple.
 He just made fun of me, and Nature did the rest.
"    Jimmy scowled in the darkness.
 Murderous thoughts towards the  unknown brute flooded his mind.
    "I wish I could meet him!" he growled.
    "You aren't likely to," said Ann.
 "He lives in England.
 His name  is Crocker.
 Jimmy Crocker.
 I spoke about him just now.
"    Through the howling of the wind cut the sharp notes of a bugle.
  Ann turned to the saloon entrance.
    "Dinner!" she said brightly.
 "How hungry one gets on board ship!"  She stopped.
 "Aren't you coming down, Mr. Bayliss?"    "Not just yet," said Jimmy thickly.
            PAINFUL SCENE IN A CAFE    The noonday sun beat down on Park Row.
 Hurrying mortals, released  from a thousand offices, congested the sidewalks, their thoughts  busy with the vision of lunch.
 Up and down the canyon of Nassau  Street the crowds moved more slowly.
 Candy-selling aliens jostled  newsboys, and huge dray-horses endeavoured to the best of their  ability not to grind the citizenry beneath their hooves.
  Eastward, pressing on to the City Hall, surged the usual dense  army of happy lovers on their way to buy marriage-licenses.
 Men  popped in and out of the subway entrances like rabbits.
 It was a  stirring, bustling scene, typical of this nerve-centre of New  York's vast body.
    Jimmy Crocker, standing in the doorway, watched the throngs  enviously.
 There were men in that crowd who chewed gum, there  were men who wore white satin ties with imitation diamond  stick-pins, there were men who, having smoked seven-tenths of a  cigar, were eating the remainder: but there was not one with whom  he would not at that moment willingly have exchanged identities.
  For these men had jobs.
 And in his present frame of mind it  seemed to him that no further ingredient was needed for the  recipe of the ultimate human bliss.
    The poet has said some very searching and unpleasant things about  the man "whose heart has ne'er within him burned as home his  footsteps he has turned from wandering on some foreign strand,"  but he might have excused Jimmy for feeling just then not so much  a warmth of heart as a cold and clammy sensation of dismay.
 He  would have had to admit that the words "High though his titles,  proud his name, boundless his wealth as wish can claim" did not  apply to Jimmy Crocker.
 The latter may have been "concentred all  on self," but his wealth consisted of one hundred and  thirty-three dollars and forty cents and his name was so far from  being proud that the mere sight of it in the files of the New  York _Sunday Chronicle_, the record-room of which he had just been  visiting, had made him consider the fact that he had changed it  to Bayliss the most sensible act of his career.
    The reason for Jimmy's lack of enthusiasm as he surveyed the  portion of his native land visible from his doorway is not far to  seek.
 The _Atlantic_ had docked on Saturday night, and Jimmy,  having driven to an excellent hotel and engaged an expensive room  therein, had left instructions at the desk that breakfast should  be served to him at ten o'clock and with it the Sunday issue of  the _Chronicle_.
 Five years had passed since he had seen the dear  old rag for which he had reported so many fires, murders,  street-accidents, and weddings: and he looked forward to its  perusal as a formal taking _seisin_ of his long-neglected country.
  Nothing could be more fitting and symbolic than that the first  morning of his return to America should find him propped up in  bed reading the good old _Chronicle_.
 Among his final meditations  as he dropped off to sleep was a gentle speculation as to who was  City editor now and whether the comic supplement was still  featuring the sprightly adventures of the Doughnut family.
    A wave of not unmanly sentiment passed over him on the following  morning as he reached out for the paper.
 The sky-line of New  York, seen as the boat comes up the bay, has its points, and the  rattle of the Elevated trains and the quaint odour of the Subway  extend a kindly welcome, but the thing that really convinces the  returned traveller that he is back on Manhattan Island is the  first Sunday paper.
 Jimmy, like every one else, began by opening  the comic supplement: and as he scanned it a chilly discomfort,  almost a premonition of evil, came upon him.
 The Doughnut Family  was no more.
 He knew that it was unreasonable of him to feel as  if he had just been informed of the death of a dear friend, for  Pa Doughnut and his associates had been having their adventures  five years before he had left the country, and even the toughest  comic supplementary hero rarely endures for a decade: but  nevertheless the shadow did fall upon his morning optimism, and  he derived no pleasure whatever from the artificial rollickings  of a degraded creature called Old Pop Dill-Pickle who was offered  as a substitute.
    But this, he was to discover almost immediately, was a trifling  disaster.
 It distressed him, but it did not affect his material  welfare.
 Tragedy really began when he turned to the magazine  section.
 Scarcely had he started to glance at it when this  headline struck him like a bullet:                PICCADILLY JIM AT IT AGAIN    And beneath it his own name.
    Nothing is so capable of diversity as the emotion we feel on  seeing our name unexpectedly in print.
 We may soar to the heights  or we may sink to the depths.
 Jimmy did the latter.
 A mere  cursory first inspection of the article revealed the fact that it  was no eulogy.
 With an unsparing hand the writer had muck-raked  his eventful past, the text on which he hung his remarks being  that ill-fated encounter with Lord Percy Whipple at the Six  Hundred Club.
 This the scribe had recounted at a length and with  a boisterous vim which outdid even Bill Blake's effort in the  London _Daily Sun_.
 Bill Blake had been handicapped by  consideration of space and the fact that he had turned in his  copy at an advanced hour when the paper was almost made up.
 The  present writer was shackled by no restrictions.
 He had plenty of  room to spread himself in, and he had spread himself.
 So liberal  had been the editor's views in the respect that, in addition to  the letter-press, the pages contained an unspeakably offensive  picture of a burly young man in an obviously advanced condition  of alcoholism raising his fist to strike a monocled youth in  evening dress who had so little chin that Jimmy was surprised  that he had ever been able to hit it.
 The only gleam of  consolation that he could discover in this repellent drawing was  the fact that the artist had treated Lord Percy even more  scurvily than himself.
 Among other things, the second son of the  Duke of Devizes was depicted as wearing a coronet--a thing which  would have excited remark even in a London night-club.
    Jimmy read the thing through in its entirety three times before  he appreciated a _nuance_ which his disordered mind had at first  failed to grasp--to wit, that this character-sketch of himself  was no mere isolated outburst but apparently one of a series.
 In  several places the writer alluded unmistakeably to other theses  on the same subject.
    Jimmy's breakfast congealed on its tray, untouched.
 That boon  which the gods so seldom bestow, of seeing ourselves as others  see us, had been accorded to him in full measure.
 By the time he  had completed his third reading he was regarding himself in a  purely objective fashion not unlike the attitude of a naturalist  towards some strange and loathesome manifestation of insect life.
  So this was the sort of fellow he was! He wondered they had let  him in at a reputable hotel.
    The rest of the day he passed in a state of such humility that he  could have wept when the waiters were civil to him.
 On the Monday  morning he made his way to Park Row to read the files of the  _Chronicle_--a morbid enterprise, akin to the eccentric behaviour  of those priests of Baal who gashed themselves with knives or of  authors who subscribe to press-clipping agencies.
    He came upon another of the articles almost at once, in an issue  not a month old.
 Then there was a gap of several weeks, and hope  revived that things might not be as bad as he had feared--only to  be crushed by another trenchant screed.
 After that he set about  his excavations methodically, resolved to know the worst.
 He  knew it in just under two hours.
 There it all was--his row with  the bookie, his bad behaviour at the political meeting, his  breach-of-promise case.
 It was a complete biography.
    And the name they called him.
 Piccadilly Jim! Ugh!    He went out into Park Row, and sought a quiet doorway where he  could brood upon these matters.
    It was not immediately that the practical or financial aspect of  the affair came to scourge him.
 For an appreciable time he  suffered in his self-esteem alone.
 It seemed to him that all  these bustling persons who passed knew him, that they were  casting sidelong glances at him and laughing derisively, that  those who chewed gum chewed it sneeringly and that those who ate  their cigars ate them with thinly-veiled disapproval and scorn.
  Then, the passage of time blunting sensitiveness, he found that  there were other and weightier things to consider.
    As far as he had had any connected plan of action in his sudden  casting-off of the flesh-pots of London, he had determined as  soon as possible after landing to report at the office of his old  paper and apply for his ancient position.
 So little thought had  he given to the minutiae of his future plans that it had not  occurred to him that he had anything to do but walk in, slap the  gang on the back, and announce that he was ready to work.
 Work!--on  the staff of a paper whose chief diversion appeared to be the  satirising of his escapades! Even had he possessed the moral  courage--or gall--to make the application, what good would it be?  He was a by-word in a world where he had once been a worthy  citizen.
 What paper would trust Piccadilly Jim with an  assignment? What paper would consider Piccadilly Jim even on  space rates? A chill dismay crept over him.
 He seemed to hear the  grave voice of Bayliss the butler speaking in his car as he had  spoken so short a while before at Paddington Station.
    "Is it not a little rash, Mr. James?"    Rash was the word.
 Here he stood, in a country that had no  possible use for him, a country where competition was keen and  jobs for the unskilled infrequent.
 What on earth was there that  he could do?    Well, he could go home.
 .
 .
 .
 No, he couldn't.
 His pride revolted  at that solution.
 Prodigal Son stuff was all very well in its  way, but it lost its impressiveness if you turned up again at  home two weeks after you had left.
 A decent interval among the  husks and swine was essential.
 Besides, there was his father to  consider.
 He might be a poor specimen of a fellow, as witness the  _Sunday Chronicle_ _passim_, but he was not so poor as to come  slinking back to upset things for his father just when he had  done the only decent thing by removing himself.
 No, that was out  of the question.
    What remained? The air of New York is bracing and healthy, but a  man cannot live on it.
 Obviously he must find a job.
 But what  job?    What could he do?    A gnawing sensation in the region of the waistcoat answered the  question.
 The solution--which it put forward was, it was true,  but a temporary one, yet it appealed strongly to Jimmy.
 He had  found it admirable at many crises.
 He would go and lunch, and it  might be that food would bring inspiration.
    He moved from his doorway and crossed to the entrance of the  subway.
 He caught a timely express, and a few minutes later  emerged into the sunlight again at Grand Central.
 He made his way  westward along Forty-second Street to the hotel which he thought  would meet his needs.
 He had scarcely entered it when in a chair  by the door he perceived Ann Chester, and at the sight of her all  his depression vanished and he was himself again.
    "Why, how do you do, Mr. Bayliss? Are you lunching here?"    "Unless there is some other place that you would prefer," said  Jimmy.
 "I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
"    Ann laughed.
 She was looking very delightful in something soft  and green.
    "I'm not going to lunch with you.
 I'm waiting for Mr. Ralstone  and his sister.
 Do you remember him? He crossed over with us.
 His  chair was next to mine on the promenade deck.
"    Jimmy was shocked.
 When he thought how narrowly she had escaped,  poor girl, from lunching with that insufferable pill Teddy--or  was it Edgar?--he felt quite weak.
 Recovering himself, he spoke  firmly.
    "When were they to have met you?"    "At one o'clock.
"    "It is now five past.
 You are certainly not going to wait any  longer.
 Come with me, and we will whistle for cabs.
"    "Don't be absurd!"    "Come along.
 I want to talk to you about my future.
"    "I shall certainly do nothing of the kind," said Ann, rising.
 She  went with him to the door.
 "Teddy would never forgive me.
" She  got into the cab.
 "It's only because you have appealed to me to  help you discuss your future," she said, as they drove off.
  "Nothing else would have induced me .
 .
 .
"    "I know," said Jimmy.
 "I felt that I could rely on your womanly  sympathy.
 Where shall we go?"    "Where do you want to go? Oh, I forget that you have never been  in New York before.
 By the way, what are your impressions of our  glorious country?"    "Most gratifying, if only I could get a job.
"    "Tell him to drive to Delmonico's.
 It's just around the corner on  Forty-fourth Street.
"    "There are some things round the corner, then?"    "That sounds cryptic.
 What do you mean.
"    "You've forgotten our conversation that night on the ship.
 You  refused to admit the existence of wonderful things just round the  corner.
 You said some very regrettable things that night.
 About  love, if you remember.
"    "You can't be going to talk about love at one o'clock in the  afternoon! Talk about your future.
"    "Love is inextricably mixed up with my future.
"    "Not with your immediate future.
 I thought you said that you were  trying to get a job.
 Have you given up the idea of newspaper  work, then?"    "Absolutely.
"    "Well, I'm rather glad.
"    The cab drew up at the restaurant door, and the conversation was  interrupted.
 When they were seated at their table and Jimmy had  given an order to the waiter of absolutely inexcusable  extravagance, Ann returned to the topic.
    "Well, now the thing is to find something for you to do.
"    Jimmy looked round the restaurant with appreciative eyes.
 The  summer exodus from New York was still several weeks distant, and  the place was full of prosperous-looking lunchers, not one of  whom appeared to have a care or an unpaid bill in the world.
 The  atmosphere was redolent of substantial bank-balances.
 Solvency  shone from the closely shaven faces of the men and reflected  itself in the dresses of the women.
 Jimmy sighed.
    "I suppose so," he said.
 "Though for choice I'd like to be one of  the Idle Rich.
 To my mind the ideal profession is strolling into  the office and touching the old dad for another thousand.
"    Ann was severe.
    "You revolt me!" she said.
 "I never heard anything so thoroughly  disgraceful.
 You _need_ work!"    "One of these days," said Jimmy plaintively, "I shall be sitting  by the roadside with my dinner-pail, and you will come by in your  limousine, and I shall look up at you and say '_You_ hounded me  into this!' How will you feel then?"    "Very proud of myself.
"    "In that case, there is no more to be said.
 I'd much rather hang  about and try to get adopted by a millionaire, but if you insist  on my working--Waiter!"    "What do you want?" asked Ann.
    "Will you get me a Classified Telephone Directory," said Jimmy.
    "What for?" asked Ann.
    "To look for a profession.
 There is nothing like being  methodical.
"    The waiter returned, bearing a red book.
 Jimmy thanked him and  opened it at the A's.
    "The boy, what will he become?" he said.
 He turned the pages.
  "How about an Auditor? What do you think of that?"    "Do you think you could audit?"    "That I could not say till I had tried.
 I might turn out to be  very good at it.
 How about an Adjuster?"    "An adjuster of what?"    "The book doesn't say.
 It just remarks broadly--in a sort of  spacious way--'Adjuster.
' I take it that, having decided to  become an adjuster, you then sit down and decide what you wish to  adjust.
 One might, for example, become an Asparagus Adjuster.
"    "A what?"    "Surely you know? Asparagus Adjusters are the fellows who sell  those rope-and-pulley affairs by means of which the Smart Set  lower asparagus into their mouths--or rather Francis the footman  does it for them, of course.
 The diner leans back in his chair,  and the menial works the apparatus in the background.
 It is  entirely superseding the old-fashioned method of picking the  vegetable up and taking a snap at it.
 But I suspect that to be a  successful Asparagus Adjuster requires capital.
 We now come to  Awning Crank and Spring Rollers.
 I don't think I should like  that.
 Rolling awning cranks seems to me a sorry way of spending  life's springtime.
 Let's try the B's.
"    "Let's try this omelette.
 It looks delicious.
" Jimmy shook his  head.
    "I will toy with it--but absently and in a _distrait_ manner, as  becomes a man of affairs.
 There's nothing in the B's.
 I might  devote my ardent youth to Bar-Room Glassware and Bottlers'  Supplies.
 On the other hand, I might not.
 Similarly, while there  is no doubt a bright future for somebody in Celluloid, Fiberloid,  and Other Factitious Goods, instinct tells me that there is none  for--" he pulled up on the verge of saying, "James Braithwaite  Crocker," and shuddered at the nearness of the pitfall.
  "--for--" he hesitated again--"for Algernon Bayliss," he  concluded.
    Ann smiled delightedly.
 It was so typical that his father should  have called him something like that.
 Time had not dimmed her  regard for the old man she had seen for that brief moment at  Paddington Station.
 He was an old dear, and she thoroughly  approved of this latest manifestation of his supposed pride in  his offspring.
    "Is that really your name--Algernon?"    "I cannot deny it.
"    "I think your father is a darling," said Ann inconsequently.
    Jimmy had buried himself in the directory again.
    "The D's," he said.
 "Is it possible that posterity will know me  as Bayliss the Dermatologist? Or as Bayliss the Drop Forger? I  don't quite like that last one.
 It may be a respectable  occupation, but it sounds rather criminal to me.
 The sentence for  forging drops is probably about twenty years with hard labour.
"    "I wish you would put that book away and go on with your lunch,"  said Ann.
    "Perhaps," said Jimmy, "my grandchildren will cluster round my  knee some day and say in their piping, childish voices, 'Tell us  how you became the Elastic Stocking King, grandpa!' What do you  think?"    "I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
 You are wasting  your time, when you ought to be either talking to me or else  thinking very seriously about what you mean to do.
"    Jimmy was turning the pages rapidly.
    "I will be with you in a moment," he said.
 "Try to amuse yourself  somehow till I am at leisure.
 Ask yourself a riddle.
 Tell  yourself an anecdote.
 Think of life.
 No, it's no good.
 I don't  see myself as a Fan Importer, a Glass Beveller, a Hotel Broker,  an Insect Exterminator, a Junk Dealer, a Kalsomine Manufacturer,  a Laundryman, a Mausoleum Architect, a Nurse, an Oculist, a  Paper-Hanger, a Quilt Designer, a Roofer, a Ship Plumber, a  Tinsmith, an Undertaker, a Veterinarian, a Wig Maker, an X-ray  apparatus manufacturer, a Yeast producer, or a Zinc Spelter.
" He  closed the book.
 "There is only one thing to do.
 I must starve in  the gutter.
 Tell me--you know New York better than I do--where is  there a good gutter?"    At this moment there entered the restaurant an Immaculate Person.
  He was a young man attired in faultlessly fitting clothes, with  shoes of flawless polish and a perfectly proportioned floweret in  his buttonhole.
 He surveyed the room through a monocle.
 He was a  pleasure to look upon, but Jimmy, catching sight of him, started  violently and felt no joy at all; for he had recognised him.
 It  was a man he knew well and who knew him well--a man whom he had  last seen a bare two weeks ago at the Bachelors' Club in London.
  Few things are certain in this world, but one was that, if  Bartling--such was the Vision's name--should see him, he would  come over and address him as Crocker.
 He braced himself to the  task of being Bayliss, the whole Bayliss, and nothing but  Bayliss.
 It might be that stout denial would carry him through.
  After all, Reggie Bartling was a man of notoriously feeble  intellect, who could believe in anything.
    The monocle continued its sweep.
 It rested on Jimmy's profile.
    "By Gad!" said the Vision.
    Reginald Bartling had landed in New York that morning, and  already the loneliness of a strange city had begun to oppress  him.
 He had come over on a visit of pleasure, his suit-case  stuffed with letters of introduction, but these he had not yet  used.
 There was a feeling of home-sickness upon him, and he ached  for a pal.
 And there before him sat Jimmy Crocker, one of the  best.
 He hastened to the table.
    "I say, Crocker, old chap, I didn't know you were over here.
 When  did you arrive?"    Jimmy was profoundly thankful that he had seen this pest in time  to be prepared for him.
 Suddenly assailed in this fashion, he  would undoubtedly have incriminated himself by recognition of his  name.
 But, having anticipated the visitation, he was able to say  a whole sentence to Ann before showing himself aware that it was  he who was addressed.
    "I say! Jimmy Crocker!"    Jimmy achieved one of the blankest stares of modern times.
 He  looked at Ann.
 Then he looked at Bartling again.
    "I think there's some mistake," he said.
 "My name is Bayliss.
"    Before his stony eye the immaculate Bartling wilted.
 It was a  perfectly astounding likeness, but it was apparent to him when  what he had ever heard and read about doubles came to him.
 He was  confused.
 He blushed.
 It was deuced bad form going up to a  perfect stranger like this and pretending you knew him.
 Probably  the chappie thought he was some kind of a confidence johnnie or  something.
 It was absolutely rotten! He continued to blush till  one could have fancied him scarlet to the ankles.
 He backed away,  apologising in ragged mutters.
 Jimmy was not insensible to the  pathos of his suffering acquaintance's position; he knew Reggie  and his devotion to good form sufficiently well to enable him to  appreciate the other's horror at having spoken to a fellow to  whom he had never been introduced; but necessity forbade any  other course.
 However Reggie's soul might writhe and however  sleepless Reggie's nights might become as a result of this  encounter, he was prepared to fight it out on those lines if it  took all summer.
 And, anyway, it was darned good for Reggie to  get a jolt like that every once in a while.
 Kept him bright and  lively.
    So thinking, he turned to Ann again, while the crimson Bartling  tottered off to restore his nerve centres to their normal tone at  some other hostelry.
 He found Ann staring amazedly at him, eyes  wide and lips parted.
    "Odd, that!" he observed with a light carelessness which he  admired extremely and of which he would not have believed himself  capable.
 "I suppose I must be somebody's double.
 What was the  name he said?"    "Jimmy Crocker!" cried Ann.
    Jimmy raised his glass, sipped, and put it down.
    "Oh yes, I remember.
 So it was.
 It's a curious thing, too, that  it sounds familiar.
 I've heard the name before somewhere.
"    "I was talking about Jimmy Crocker on the ship.
 That evening on  deck.
"    Jimmy looked at her doubtfully.
    "Were you? Oh yes, of course.
 I've got it now.
 He is the man you  dislike so.
"    Ann was still looking at him as if he had undergone a change into  something new and strange.
    "I hope you aren't going to let the resemblance prejudice you  against _me_?" said Jimmy.
 "Some are born Jimmy Crockers, others  have Jimmy Crockers thrust upon them.
 I hope you'll bear in mind  that I belong to the latter class.
"    "It's such an extraordinary thing.
"    "Oh, I don't know.
 You often hear of doubles.
 There was a man in  England a few years ago who kept getting sent to prison for  things some genial stranger who happened to look like him had  done.
"    "I don't mean that.
 Of course there are doubles.
 But it is  curious that you should have come over here and that we should  have met like this at just this time.
 You see, the reason I went  over to England at all was to try to get Jimmy Crocker to come  back here.
"    "What!"    "I don't mean that _I_ did.
 I mean that I went with my uncle and  aunt, who wanted to persuade him to come and live with them.
"    Jimmy was now feeling completely out of his depth.
    "Your uncle and aunt? Why?"    "I ought to have explained that they are his uncle and aunt, too.
  My aunt's sister married his father.
"    "But--"    "It's quite simple, though it doesn't sound so.
 Perhaps you  haven't read the _Sunday Chronicle_ lately? It has been publishing  articles about Jimmy Crocker's disgusting behaviour in  London--they call him Piccadilly Jim, you know--"    In print, that name had shocked Jimmy.
 Spoken, and by Ann, it was  loathly.
 Remorse for his painful past tore at him.
    "There was another one printed yesterday.
"    "I saw it," said Jimmy, to avert description.
    "Oh, did you? Well, just to show you what sort of a man Jimmy  Crocker is, the Lord Percy Whipple whom he attacked in the club  was his very best friend.
 His step-mother told my aunt so.
 He  seems to be absolutely hopeless.
" She smiled.
 "You're looking  quite sad, Mr. Bayliss.
 Cheer up! You may look like him, but you  aren't him he?--him?--no, 'he' is right.
 The soul is what counts.
  If you've got a good, virtuous, Algernonish soul, it doesn't  matter if you're so like Jimmy Crocker that his friends come up  and talk to you in restaurants.
 In fact, it's rather an  advantage, really.
 I'm sure that if you were to go to my aunt and  pretend to be Jimmy Crocker, who had come over after all in a fit  of repentance, she would be so pleased that there would be  nothing she wouldn't do for you.
 You might realise your ambition  of being adopted by a millionaire.
 Why don't you try it? I won't  give you away.
"    "Before they found me out and hauled me off to prison, I should  have been near you for a time.
 I should have lived in the same  house with you, spoken to you--!" Jimmy's voice shook.
    Ann turned her head to address an imaginary companion.
    "You must listen to this, my dear," she said in an undertone.
 "He  speaks _wonderfully!_ They used to call him the Boy Orator in his  home-town.
 Sometimes that, and sometimes Eloquent Algernon!"    Jimmy eyed her fixedly.
 He disapproved of this frivolity.
    "One of these days you will try me too high--!"    "Oh, you didn't hear what I was saying to my friend, did you?"  she said in concern.
 "But I meant it, every word.
 I love to hear  you talk.
 You have such _feeling!_"    Jimmy attuned himself to the key of the conversation.
    "Have you no sentiment in you?" he demanded.
    "I was just warming up, too! In another minute you would have  heard something worth while.
 You've damped me now.
 Let's talk  about my lifework again.
"    "Have you thought of anything?"    "I'd like to be one of those fellows who sit in offices, and sign  checks, and tell the office-boy to tell Mr. Rockerfeller they can  give him five minutes.
 But of course I should need a check-book,  and I haven't got one.
 Oh well, I shall find something to do all  right.
 Now tell me something about yourself.
 Let's drop the  future for awhile.
"                                                An hour later Jimmy turned into Broadway.
 He walked pensively,  for he had much to occupy his mind.
 How strange that the Petts  should have come over to England to try to induce him to return  to New York, and how galling that, now that he was in New York,  this avenue to a prosperous future was closed by the fact that  something which he had done five years ago--that he could  remember nothing about it was quite maddening--had caused Ann to  nurse this abiding hatred of him.
 He began to dream tenderly of  Ann, bumping from pedestrian to pedestrian in a gentle trance.
    From this trance the seventh pedestrian aroused him by uttering  his name, the name which circumstances had compelled him to  abandon.
    "Jimmy Crocker!"    Surprise brought Jimmy back from his dreams to the hard  world--surprise and a certain exasperation.
 It was ridiculous to be  incognito in a city which he had not visited in five years and to  be instantly recognised in this way by every second man he met.
  He looked sourly at the man.
 The other was a sturdy,  square-shouldered, battered young man, who wore on his homely  face a grin of recognition and regard.
 Jimmy was not particularly  good at remembering faces, but this person's was of a kind which  the poorest memory might have recalled.
 It was, as the  advertisements say, distinctively individual.
 The broken nose,  the exiguous forehead, and the enlarged ears all clamoured for  recognition.
 The last time Jimmy had seen Jerry Mitchell had been  two years before at the National Sporting Club in London, and,  placing him at once, he braced himself, as a short while ago he  had braced himself to confound immaculate Reggie.
    "Hello!" said the battered one.
    "Hello indeed!" said Jimmy courteously.
 "In what way can I  brighten your life?"    The grin faded from the other's face.
 He looked puzzled.
    "You're Jimmy Crocker, ain't you?"    "No.
 My name chances to be Algernon Bayliss.
"    Jerry Mitchell reddened.
    "'Scuse me.
 My mistake.
"    He was moving off, but Jimmy stopped him.
 Parting from Ann had  left a large gap in his life, and he craved human society.
    "I know you now," he said.
 "You're Jerry Mitchell.
 I saw you  fight Kid Burke four years ago in London.
"    The grin returned to the pugilist's face, wider than ever.
 He  beamed with gratification.
    "Gee! Think of that! I've quit since then.
 I'm working for an old  guy named Pett.
 Funny thing, he's Jimmy Crocker's uncle that I  mistook you for.
 Say, you're a dead ringer for that guy! I could  have sworn it was him when you bumped into me.
 Say, are you doing  anything?"    "Nothing in particular.
"    "Come and have a yarn.
 There's a place I know just round by  here.
"    "Delighted.
"    They made their way to the place.
    "What's yours?" said Jerry Mitchell.
 "I'm on the wagon myself,"  he said apologetically.
    "So am I," said Jimmy.
 "It's the only way.
 No sense in always  drinking and making a disgraceful exhibition of yourself in  public!"    Jerry Mitchell received this homily in silence.
 It disposed  definitely of the lurking doubt in his mind as to the possibility  of this man really being Jimmy Crocker.
 Though outwardly  convinced by the other's denial, he had not been able to rid  himself till now of a nebulous suspicion.
 But this convinced him.
  Jimmy Crocker would never have said a thing like that nor would  have refused the offer of alcohol.
 He fell into pleasant  conversation with him.
 His mind eased.
            MRS.
 PETT IS SHOCKED    At five o'clock in the afternoon some ten days after her return  to America, Mrs. Pett was at home to her friends in the house on  Riverside Drive.
 The proceedings were on a scale that amounted to  a reception, for they were not only a sort of official  notification to New York that one of its most prominent hostesses  was once more in its midst, but were also designed to entertain  and impress Mr. Hammond Chester, Ann's father, who had been  spending a couple of days in the metropolis preparatory to  departing for South America on one of his frequent trips.
 He was  very fond of Ann in his curious, detached way, though he never  ceased in his private heart to consider it injudicious of her not  to have been born a boy, and he always took in New York for a day  or two on his way from one wild and lonely spot to another, if he  could manage it.
    The large drawing-room overlooking the Hudson was filled almost  to capacity with that strange mixture of humanity which Mrs. Pett  chiefly affected.
 She prided herself on the Bohemian element in  her parties, and had become during the past two years a human  drag-net, scooping Genius from its hiding-place and bringing it  into the open.
 At different spots in the room stood the six  resident geniuses to whose presence in the home Mr. Pett had such  strong objections, and in addition to these she had collected so  many more of a like breed from the environs of Washington Square  that the air was clamorous with the hoarse cries of futurist  painters, esoteric Buddhists, _vers libre_ poets, interior  decorators, and stage reformers, sifted in among the more  conventional members of society who had come to listen to them.
  Men with new religions drank tea with women with new hats.
  Apostles of Free Love expounded their doctrines to persons who  had been practising them for years without realising it.
 All over  the room throats were being strained and minds broadened.
    Mr. Chester, standing near the door with Ann, eyed the assemblage  with the genial contempt of a large dog for a voluble pack of  small ones.
 He was a massive, weather-beaten man, who looked very  like Ann in some ways and would have looked more like her but for  the misfortune of having had some of his face clawed away by an  irritable jaguar with whom he had had a difference some years  back in the jungles of Peru.
    "Do you like this sort of thing?" he asked.
    "I don't mind it," said Ann.
    "Well, I shall be very sorry to leave you, Ann, but I'm glad I'm  pulling out of here this evening.
 Who are all these people?"    Ann surveyed the gathering.
    "That's Ernest Wisden, the playwright, over there, talking to  Lora Delane Porter, the feminist writer.
 That's Clara  What's-her-name, the sculptor, with the bobbed hair.
 Next to  her--"    Mr. Chester cut short the catalogue with a stifled yawn.
    "Where's old Pete? Doesn't he come to these jamborees?"    Ann laughed.
    "Poor uncle Peter! If he gets back from the office before these  people leave, he will sneak up to his room and stay there till  it's safe to come out.
 The last time I made him come to one of  these parties he was pounced on by a woman who talked to him for  an hour about the morality of Finance and seemed to think that  millionaires were the scum of the earth.
"    "He never would stand up for himself.
" Mr. Chester's gaze hovered  about the room, and paused.
 "Who's that fellow? I believe I've  seen him before somewhere.
"    A constant eddying swirl was animating the multitude.
 Whenever  the mass tended to congeal, something always seemed to stir it up  again.
 This was due to the restless activity of Mrs. Pett, who  held it to be the duty of a good hostess to keep her guests  moving.
 From the moment when the room began to fill till the  moment when it began to empty she did not cease to plough her way  to and fro, in a manner equally reminiscent of a hawk swooping on  chickens and an earnest collegian bucking the line.
 Her guests  were as a result perpetually forming new ententes and  combinations, finding themselves bumped about like those little  moving figures which one sees in shop-windows on Broadway, which  revolve on a metal disc until, urged by impact with another  little figure, they scatter to regroup themselves elsewhere.
 It  was a fascinating feature of Mrs. Pett's at-homes and one which  assisted that mental broadening process already alluded to that  one never knew, when listening to a discussion on the sincerity  of Oscar Wilde, whether it would not suddenly change in the  middle of a sentence to an argument on the inner meaning of the  Russian Ballet.
    Plunging now into a group dominated for the moment by an angular  woman who was saying loud and penetrating things about the  suffrage, Mrs. Pett had seized and removed a tall, blonde young  man with a mild, vacuous face.
 For the past few minutes this  young man had been sitting bolt upright on a chair with his hands  on his knees, so exactly in the manner of an end-man at a  minstrel show that one would hardly have been surprised had he  burst into song or asked a conundrum.
    Ann followed her father's gaze.
    "Do you mean the man talking to aunt Nesta? There, they've gone  over to speak to Willie Partridge.
 Do you mean that one?"    "Yes.
 Who is he?"    "Well, I like that!" said Ann.
 "Considering that you introduced  him to us! That's Lord Wisbeach, who came to uncle Peter with a  letter of introduction from you.
 You met him in Canada.
"    "I remember now.
 I ran across him in British Columbia.
 We camped  together one night.
 I'd never seen him before and I didn't see  him again.
 He said he wanted a letter to old Pete for some  reason, so I scribbled him one in pencil on the back of an  envelope.
 I've never met any one who played a better game of draw  poker.
 He cleaned me out.
 There's a lot in that fellow, in spite  of his looking like a musical comedy dude.
 He's clever.
"    Ann looked at him meditatively.
    "It's odd that you should be discovering hidden virtues in Lord  Wisbeach, father.
 I've been trying to make up my mind about him.
  He wants me to marry him.
"    "He does! I suppose a good many of these young fellows here want  the same thing, don't they, Ann?" Mr. Chester looked at his  daughter with interest.
 Her growing-up and becoming a beauty had  always been a perplexity to him.
 He could never rid himself of  the impression of her as a long-legged child in short skirts.
 "I  suppose you're refusing them all the time?"    "Every day from ten to four, with an hour off for lunch.
 I keep  regular office hours.
 Admission on presentation of visiting  card.
"    "And how do you feel about this Lord Wisbeach?"    "I don't know," said Ann frankly.
 "He's very nice.
 And--what is  more important--he's different.
 Most of the men I know are all  turned out of the same mould.
 Lord Wisbeach--and one other  man--are the only two I've met who might not be the brothers of  all the rest.
"    "Who's the other?"    "A man I hardly know.
 I met him on board ship--"    Mr. Chester looked at his watch.
    "It's up to you, Ann," he said.
 "There's one comfort in being  your father--I don't mean that exactly; I mean that it is a  comfort to me AS your father--to know that I need feel no  paternal anxiety about you.
 I don't have to give you advice.
  You've not only got three times the sense that I have, but you're  not the sort of girl who would take advice.
 You've always known  just what you wanted ever since you were a kid.
 .
 .
 .
 Well, if  you're going to take me down to the boat, we'd better be  starting.
 Where's the car?"    "Waiting outside.
 Aren't you going to say good-bye to aunt  Nesta?"    "Good God, no!" exclaimed Mr. Chester in honest concern.
 "What!  Plunge into that pack of coyotes and fight my way through to her!  I'd be torn to pieces by wild poets.
 Besides, it seems silly to  make a fuss saying good-bye when I'm only going to be away a  short time.
 I shan't go any further than Colombia this trip.
"    "You'll be able to run back for week-ends," said Ann.
    She paused at the door to cast a fleeting glance over her  shoulder at the fair-haired Lord Wisbeach, who was now in  animated conversation with her aunt and Willie Partridge; then  she followed her father down the stairs.
 She was a little  thoughtful as she took her place at the wheel of her automobile.
  It was not often that her independent nature craved outside  support, but she was half conscious of wishing at the present  juncture that she possessed a somewhat less casual father.
 She  would have liked to ask him to help her decide a problem which  had been vexing her for nearly three weeks now, ever since Lord  Wisbeach had asked her to marry him and she had promised to give  him his answer on her return from England.
 She had been back in  New York several days now, but she had not been able to make up  her mind.
 This annoyed her, for she was a girl who liked swift  decisiveness of thought and action both in others and in herself.
  She was fond of Mr. Chester in much the same unemotional,  detached way that he was fond of her, but she was perfectly well  aware of the futility of expecting counsel from him.
 She said  good-bye to him at the boat, fussed over his comfort for awhile  in a motherly way, and then drove slowly back.
 For the first time  in her life she was feeling uncertain of herself.
 When she had  left for England, she had practically made up her mind to accept  Lord Wisbeach, and had only deferred actual acceptance of him  because in her cool way she wished to re-examine the position at  her leisure.
 Second thoughts had brought no revulsion of feeling.
  She had not wavered until her arrival in New York.
 Then, for some  reason which baffled her, the idea of marrying Lord Wisbeach had  become vaguely distasteful.
 And now she found herself fluctuating  between this mood and her former one.
    She reached the house on Riverside Drive, but did not slacken the  speed of the machine.
 She knew that Lord Wisbeach would be  waiting for her there, and she did not wish to meet him just yet.
  She wanted to be alone.
 She was feeling depressed.
 She wondered  if this was because she had just departed from her father, and  decided that it was.
 His swift entrances into and exits from her  life always left her temporarily restless.
 She drove on up the  river.
 She meant to decide her problem one way or the other  before she returned home.
    Lord Wisbeach, meanwhile, was talking to Mrs. Pett and Willie,  its inventor, about Partridgite.
 Willie, on hearing himself  addressed, had turned slowly with an air of absent  self-importance, the air of a great thinker disturbed in  mid-thought.
 He always looked like that when spoken to, and there  were those--Mr. Pett belonged to this school of thought--who held  that there was nothing to him beyond that look and that he had  built up his reputation as a budding mastermind on a foundation  that consisted entirely of a vacant eye, a mop of hair through  which he could run his fingers, and the fame of his late father.
    Willie Partridge was the son of the great inventor, Dwight  Partridge, and it was generally understood that the explosive,  Partridgite, was to be the result of a continuation of  experiments which his father had been working upon at the time of  his death.
 That Dwight Partridge had been trying experiments in  the direction of a new and powerful explosive during the last  year of his life was common knowledge in those circles which are  interested in such things.
 Foreign governments were understood to  have made tentative overtures to him.
 But a sudden illness,  ending fatally, had finished the budding career of Partridgite  abruptly, and the world had thought no more of it until an  interview in the _Sunday Chronicle_, that store-house of  information about interesting people, announced that Willie was  carrying on his father's experiments at the point where he had  left off.
 Since then there had been vague rumours of possible  sensational developments, which Willie had neither denied nor  confirmed.
 He preserved the mysterious silence which went so well  with his appearance.
    Having turned slowly so that his eyes rested on Lord Wisbeach's  ingenuous countenance, Willie paused, and his face assumed the  expression of his photograph in the _Chronicle_.
    "Ah, Wisbeach!" he said.
    Lord Wisbeach did not appear to resent the patronage of his  manner.
 He plunged cheerily into talk.
 He had a pleasant, simple  way of comporting himself which made people like him.
    "I was just telling Mrs. Pett," he said, "that I shouldn't be  surprised if you were to get an offer for your stuff from our  fellows at home before long.
 I saw a lot of our War Office men  when I was in England, don't you know.
 Several of them mentioned  the stuff.
"    Willie resented Partridgite as being referred to as "the stuff,"  but he made allowance.
 All Englishmen talked that way, he  supposed.
    "Indeed?" he said.
    "Of course," said Mrs. Pett, "Willie is a patriot and would have  to give our own authorities the first chance.
"    "Rather!"    "But you know what officials are all over the world.
 They are so  sceptical and they move so slowly.
"    "I know.
 Our men at home are just the same as a rule.
 I've got a  pal who invented something-or-other, I forget what, but it was a  most decent little contrivance and very useful and all that; and  he simply can't get them to say Yes or No about it.
 But, all the  same, I wonder you didn't have some of them trying to put out  feelers to you when you were in London.
"    "Oh, we were only in London a few hours.
 By the way, Lord  Wisbeach, my sister--"--Mrs. Pett paused; she disliked to have to  mention her sister or to refer to this subject at all, but  curiosity impelled her--"my sister said that you are a great  friend of her step-son, James Crocker.
 I didn't know that you  knew him.
"    Lord Wisbeach seemed to hesitate for a moment.
    "He's not coming over, is he? Pity! It would have done him a  world of good.
 Yes, Jimmy Crocker and I have always been great  pals.
 He's a bit of a nut, of course, .
 .
 .
 I beg your pardon!  .
 .
 .
 I mean .
 .
 .
" He broke off confusedly, and turned to Willie  again to cover himself.
 "How are you getting on with the jolly  old stuff?" he asked.
    If Willie had objected to Partridgite being called "the stuff,"  he was still less in favour of its being termed "the jolly old  stuff.
" He replied coldly.
    "I have ceased to get along with the jolly old stuff.
"    "Struck a snag?" enquired Lord Wisbeach sympathetically.
    "On the contrary, my experiments have been entirely successful.
 I  have enough Partridgite in my laboratory to blow New York to  bits!"    "Willie!" exclaimed Mrs. Pett.
 "Why didn't you tell me before?  You know I am so interested.
"    "I only completed my work last night.
"    He moved off with an important nod.
 He was tired of Lord  Wisbeach's society.
 There was something about the young man which  he did not like.
 He went to find more congenial company in a  group by the window.
    Lord Wisbeach turned to his hostess.
 The vacuous expression had  dropped from his face like a mask.
 A pair of keen and intelligent  eyes met Mrs. Pett's.
    "Mrs. Pett, may I speak to you seriously?"    Mrs. Pett's surprise at the alteration in the man prevented her  from replying.
 Much as she liked Lord Wisbeach, she had never  given him credit for brains, and it was a man with brains and  keen ones who was looking at her now.
 She nodded.
    "If your nephew has really succeeded in his experiments, you  should be awfully careful.
 That stuff ought not to lie about in  his laboratory, though no doubt he has hidden it as carefully as  possible.
 It ought to be in a safe somewhere.
 In that safe in  your library.
 News of this kind moves like lightning.
 At this  very moment, there may be people watching for a chance of getting  at the stuff.
"    Every nerve in Mrs. Pett's body, every cell of a brain which had  for years been absorbing and giving out sensational fiction,  quivered irrepressibly at these words, spoken in a low, tense  voice which gave them additional emphasis.
 Never had she  misjudged a man as she had misjudged Lord Wisbeach.
    "Spies?" she quavered.
    "They wouldn't call themselves that," said Lord Wisbeach.
 "Secret  Service agents.
 Every country has its men whose only duty it is  to handle this sort of work.
"    "They would try to steal Willie's--?" Mrs. Pett's voice failed.
    "They would not look on it as stealing.
 Their motives would be  patriotic.
 I tell you, Mrs. Pett, I have heard stories from  friends of mine in the English Secret Service which would amaze  you.
 Perfectly straight men in private life, but absolutely  unscrupulous when at work.
 They stick at nothing--nothing.
 If I  were you, I should suspect every one, especially every stranger.
"  He smiled engagingly.
 "You are thinking that that is odd advice  from one who is practically a stranger like myself.
 Never mind.
  Suspect me, too, if you like.
 Be on the safe side.
"    "I would not dream of doing such a thing, Lord Wisbeach," said  Mrs. Pett horrified.
 "I trust you implicitly.
 Even supposing such  a thing were possible, would you have warned me like this, if you  had been--?"    "That's true," said Lord Wisbeach.
 "I never thought of that.
  Well, let me say, suspect everybody but me.
" He stopped abruptly.
  "Mrs. Pett," he whispered, "don't look round for a moment.
  Wait.
" The words were almost inaudible.
 "Who is that man behind  you? He has been listening to us.
 Turn slowly.
"    With elaborate carelessness, Mrs. Pett turned her head.
 At first  she thought her companion must have alluded to one of a small  group of young men who, very improperly in such surroundings,  were discussing with raised voices the prospects of the clubs  competing for the National League Baseball Pennant.
 Then,  extending the sweep of her gaze, she saw that she had been  mistaken.
 Midway between her and this group stood a single  figure, the figure of a stout man in a swallow-tail suit, who  bore before him a tray with cups on it.
 As she turned, this man  caught her eye, gave a guilty start, and hurried across the room.
    "You saw?" said Lord Wisbeach.
 "He was listening.
 Who is that  man? Your butler apparently.
 What do you know of him?"    "He is my new butler.
 His name is Skinner.
"    "Ah, your _new_ butler? He hasn't been with you long, then?"    "He only arrived from England three days ago.
"    "From England? How did he get in here? I mean, on whose  recommendation?"    "Mr. Pett offered him the place when we met him at my sister's in  London.
 We went over there to see my sister, Eugenia--Mrs.  Crocker.
 This man was the butler who admitted us.
 He asked Mr.  Pett something about baseball, and Mr. Pett was so pleased that  he offered him a place here if he wanted to come over.
 The man  did not give any definite answer then, but apparently he sailed  on the next boat, and came to the house a few days after we had  returned.
"    Lord Wisbeach laughed softly.
    "Very smart.
 Of course they had him planted there for the  purpose.
"    "What ought I to do?" asked Mrs. Pett agitatedly.
    "Do nothing.
 There is nothing that you can do, for the present,  except keep your eyes open.
 Watch this man Skinner.
 See if he has  any accomplices.
 It is hardly likely that he is working alone.
  Suspect everybody.
 Believe me .
 .
 .
"    At this moment, apparently from some upper region, there burst  forth an uproar so sudden and overwhelming that it might well  have been taken for a premature testing of a large sample of  Partridgite; until a moment later it began to resemble more  nearly the shrieks of some partially destroyed victim of that  death-dealing invention.
 It was a bellow of anguish, and it  poured through the house in a cascade of sound, advertising to  all beneath the roof the twin facts that some person unknown was  suffering and that whoever the sufferer might be he had excellent  lungs.
    The effect on the gathering in the drawing-room was immediate and  impressive.
 Conversation ceased as if it had been turned off with  a tap.
 Twelve separate and distinct discussions on twelve highly  intellectual topics died instantaneously.
 It was as if the last  trump had sounded.
 Futurist painters stared pallidly at _vers  libre_ poets, speech smitten from their lips; and stage performers  looked at esoteric Buddhists with a wild surmise.
    The sudden silence had the effect of emphasising the strange  noise and rendering it more distinct, thus enabling it to carry  its message to one at least of the listeners.
 Mrs. Pett, after a  moment of strained attention in which time seemed to her to stand  still, uttered a wailing cry and leaped for the door.
    "Ogden!" she shrilled; and passed up the stairs two at a time,  gathering speed as she went.
 A boy's best friend is his mother.
            INSTRUCTION IN DEPORTMENT    While the feast of reason and flow of soul had been in progress  in the drawing-room, in the gymnasium on the top floor Jerry  Mitchell, awaiting the coming of Mr. Pett, had been passing the  time in improving with strenuous exercise his already impressive  physique.
 If Mrs. Pett's guests had been less noisily  concentrated on their conversation, they might have heard the  muffled _tap-tap-tap_ that proclaimed that Jerry Mitchell was  punching the bag upstairs.
    It was not until he had punched it for perhaps five minutes that,  desisting from his labours, he perceived that he had the pleasure  of the company of little Ogden Ford.
 The stout boy was standing  in the doorway, observing him with an attentive eye.
    "What are you doing?" enquired Ogden.
    Jerry passed a gloved fist over his damp brow.
    "Punchin' the bag.
"    He began to remove his gloves, eyeing Ogden the while with a  disapproval which he made no attempt to conceal.
 An extremist on  the subject of keeping in condition, the spectacle of the bulbous  stripling was a constant offence to him.
 Ogden, in pursuance of  his invariable custom on the days when Mrs. Pett entertained, had  been lurking on the stairs outside the drawing-room for the past  hour, levying toll on the food-stuffs that passed his way.
 He  wore a congested look, and there was jam about his mouth.
    "Why?" he said, retrieving a morsel of jam from his right cheek  with the tip of his tongue.
    "To keep in condition.
"    "Why do you want to keep in condition?"    Jerry flung the gloves into their locker.
    "Fade!" he said wearily.
 "Fade!"    "Huh?"    "Beat it!"    "Huh?" Much pastry seemed to have clouded the boy's mind.
    "Run away.
"    "Don't want to run away.
"    The annoyed pugilist sat down and scrutinised his visitor  critically.
    "You never do anything you don't want to, I guess?"    "No," said Ogden simply.
 "You've got a funny nose," he added  dispassionately.
 "What did you do to it to make it like that?"    Mr. Mitchell shifted restlessly on his chair.
 He was not a vain  man, but he was a little sensitive about that particular item in  his make-up.
    "Lizzie says it's the funniest nose she ever saw.
 She says it's  something out of a comic supplement.
"    A dull flush, such as five minutes with the bag had been unable  to produce, appeared on Jerry Mitchell's peculiar countenance.
 It  was not that he looked on Lizzie Murphy, herself no Lillian  Russell, as an accepted authority on the subject of facial  beauty; but he was aware that in this instance she spoke not  without reason, and he was vexed, moreover, as many another had  been before him, by the note of indulgent patronage in Ogden's  voice.
 His fingers twitched a little eagerly, and he looked  sullenly at his tactless junior.
    "Get out!"    "Huh?"    "Get outa here!"    "Don't want to get out of here," said Ogden with finality.
 He put  his hand in his trouser-pocket and pulled out a sticky mass which  looked as if it might once have been a cream-puff or a meringue.
  He swallowed it contentedly.
 "I'd forgotten I had that," he  explained.
 "Mary gave it to me on the stairs.
 Mary thinks you've  a funny nose, too," he proceeded, as one relating agreeable  gossip.
    "Can it! Can it!" exclaimed the exasperated pugilist.
    "I'm only telling you what I heard her say.
"    Mr. Mitchell rose convulsively and took a step towards his  persecutor, breathing noisily through the criticised organ.
 He  was a chivalrous man, a warm admirer of the sex, but he was  conscious of a wish that it was in his power to give Mary what he  would have described as "hers.
" She was one of the parlour-maids,  a homely woman with a hard eye, and it was part of his grievance  against her that his Maggie, alias Celestine, Mrs. Pett's maid,  had formed an enthusiastic friendship with her.
 He had no  evidence to go on, but he suspected Mary of using her influence  with Celestine to urge the suit of his leading rival for the  latter's hand, Biggs the chauffeur.
 He disliked Mary intensely,  even on general grounds.
 Ogden's revelation added fuel to his  aversion.
 For a moment he toyed with the fascinating thought of  relieving his feelings by spanking the boy, but restrained  himself reluctantly at the thought of the inevitable ruin which  would ensue.
 He had been an inmate of the house long enough to  know, with a completeness which would have embarrassed that  gentleman, what a cipher Mr. Pett was in the home and how little  his championship would avail in the event of a clash with Mrs.  Pett.
 And to give Ogden that physical treatment which should long  since have formed the main plank in the platform of his education  would be to invite her wrath as nothing else could.
 He checked  himself, and reached out for the skipping-rope, hoping to ease  his mind by further exercise.
    Ogden, chewing the remains of the cream-puff, eyed him with  languid curiosity.
    "What are you doing that for?"    Mr. Mitchell skipped grimly on.
    "What are you doing that for? I thought only girls skipped.
"    Mr. Mitchell paid no heed.
 Ogden, after a moment's silent  contemplation, returned to his original train of thought.
    "I saw an advertisement in a magazine the other day of a sort of  machine for altering the shape of noses.
 You strap it on when you  go to bed.
 You ought to get pop to blow you to one.
"    Jerry Mitchell breathed in a laboured way.
    "You want to look nice about the place, don't you? Well, then!  there's no sense in going around looking like that if you don't  have to, is there? I heard Mary talking about your nose to Biggs  and Celestine.
 She said she had to laugh every time she saw it.
"    The skipping-rope faltered in its sweep, caught in the skipper's  legs, and sent him staggering across the room.
 Ogden threw back  his head and laughed merrily.
 He liked free entertainments, and  this struck him as a particularly enjoyable one.
    There are moments in the life of every man when the impulse  attacks him to sacrifice his future to the alluring gratification  of the present.
 The strong man resists such impulses.
 Jerry  Mitchell was not a weak man, but he had been sorely tried.
 The  annoyance of Ogden's presence and conversation had sapped his  self-restraint, as dripping water will wear away a rock.
 A short  while before, he had fought down the urgent temptation to  massacre this exasperating child, but now, despised love adding  its sting to that of injured vanity, he forgot the consequences.
  Bounding across the room, he seized Ogden in a powerful grip, and  the next instant the latter's education, in the true sense of the  word, so long postponed, had begun; and with it that avalanche of  sound which, rolling down into the drawing-room, hurled Mrs. Pett  so violently and with such abruptness from the society of her  guests.
    Disposing of the last flight of stairs with the agility of the  chamois which leaps from crag to crag of the snow-topped Alps,  Mrs. Pett finished with a fine burst of speed along the passage  on the top floor, and rushed into the gymnasium just as Jerry's  avenging hand was descending for the eleventh time.
            JIMMY DECIDES TO BE HIMSELF    It was less than a quarter of an hour later--such was the speed  with which Nemesis, usually slow, had overtaken him--that Jerry  Mitchell, carrying a grip and walking dejectedly, emerged from  the back premises of the Pett home and started down Riverside  Drive in the direction of his boarding-house, a cheap, clean, and  respectable establishment situated on Ninety-seventh Street  between the Drive and Broadway.
 His usually placid nervous system  was ruffled and a-quiver from the events of the afternoon, and  his cauliflower ears still burned reminiscently at the  recollection of the uncomplimentary words shot at them by Mrs.  Pett before she expelled him from the house.
 Moreover, he was in  a mild panic at the thought of having to see Ann later on and try  to explain the disaster to her.
 He knew how the news would affect  her.
 She had set her heart on removing Ogden to more disciplinary  surroundings, and she could not possibly do it now that her ally  was no longer an inmate of the house.
 He was an essential factor  in the scheme, and now, to gratify the desire of the moment, he  had eliminated himself.
 Long before he reached the brown-stone  house, which looked exactly like all the other brown-stone houses  in all the other side-streets of uptown New York, the first fine  careless rapture of his mad outbreak had passed from Jerry  Mitchell, leaving nervous apprehension in its place.
 Ann was a  girl whom he worshipped respectfully, but he feared her in her  wrath.
    Having entered the boarding-house, Jerry, seeking company in his  hour of sorrow, climbed the stairs till he reached a door on the  second floor.
 Sniffing and detecting the odour of tobacco, he  knocked and was bidden to enter.
    "Hello, Bayliss!" he said sadly, having obeyed the call.
    He sat down on the end of the bed and heaved a deep sigh.
    The room which he had entered was airy but small, so small,  indeed, that the presence of any furniture in it at all was  almost miraculous, for at first sight it seemed incredible that  the bed did not fill it from side to side.
 There were however, a  few vacant spots, and in these had been placed a wash-stand, a  chest of drawers, and a midget rocking-chair.
 The window, which  the thoughtful architect had designed at least three sizes too  large for the room and which admitted the evening air in pleasing  profusion, looked out onto a series of forlorn back-yards.
 In  boarding-houses, it is only the windows of the rich and haughty  that face the street.
    On the bed, a corn-cob pipe between his teeth, lay Jimmy Crocker.
  He was shoeless and in his shirt-sleeves.
 There was a crumpled  evening paper on the floor beside the bed.
 He seemed to be taking  his rest after the labours of a trying day.
    At the sound of Jerry's sigh he raised his head, but, finding the  attitude too severe a strain on the muscles of the neck, restored  it to the pillow.
    "What's the matter, Jerry? You seem perturbed.
 You have the  aspect of one whom Fate has smitten in the spiritual solar  plexus, or of one who has been searching for the leak in Life's  gaspipe with a lighted candle.
 What's wrong?"    "Curtains!"    Jimmy, through long absence from his native land, was not always  able to follow Jerry's thoughts when concealed in the wrappings  of the peculiar dialect which he affected.
    "I get you not, friend.
 Supply a few footnotes.
"    "I've been fired.
"    Jimmy sat up.
 This was no imaginary trouble, no mere _malaise_  of the temperament.
 It was concrete, and called for sympathy.
    "I'm awfully sorry," he said.
 "No wonder you aren't rollicking.
  How did it happen?"    "That half-portion Bill Taft came joshing me about my beezer till  it got something fierce," explained Jerry.
 "William J.
 Bryan  couldn't have stood for it.
"    Once again Jimmy lost the thread.
 The wealth of political  allusion baffled him.
    "What's Taft been doing to you?"    "It wasn't Taft.
 He only looks like him.
 It was that kid Ogden up  where I work.
 He came butting into the gym, joshing me  about--makin' pers'nal remarks till I kind of lost my goat, and  the next thing I knew I was giving him his!" A faint gleam of  pleasure lightened the gloom of his face.
 "I cert'nly give him  his!" The gleam faded.
 "And after that--well, here I am!"    Jimmy understood now.
 He had come to the boarding-house the night  of his meeting with Jerry Mitchell on Broadway, and had been  there ever since, and frequent conversations with the pugilist  had put him abreast of affairs at the Pett home.
 He was familiar  with the _personnel_ of the establishment on Riverside Drive,  and knew precisely how great was the crime of administering  correction to Ogden Ford, no matter what the cause.
 Nor did he  require explanation of the phenomenon of Mrs. Pett dismissing one  who was in her husband's private employment.
 Jerry had his  sympathy freely.
    "You appear," he said, "to have acted in a thoroughly capable and  praiseworthy manner.
 The only point in your conduct which I would  permit myself to criticise is your omission to slay the kid.
  That, however, was due, I take it, to the fact that you were  interrupted.
 We will now proceed to examine the future.
 I cannot  see that it is altogether murky.
 You have lost a good job, but  there are others, equally good, for a man of your calibre.
 New  York is crammed with dyspeptic millionaires who need an efficient  physical instructor to look after them.
 Cheer up, Cuthbert, for  the sun is still shining!"    Jerry Mitchell shook his head.
 He refused to be comforted.
    "It's Miss Ann," he said.
 "What am I going to say to her?"    "What has she got to do with it?" asked Jimmy, interested.
    For a moment Jerry hesitated, but the desire for sympathy and  advice was too strong for him.
 And after all there was no harm in  confiding in a good comrade like Jimmy.
    "It's like this," he said.
 "Miss Ann and me had got it all fixed  up to kidnap the kid!"    "What!"    "Say, I don't mean ordinary kidnapping.
 It's this way.
 Miss Ann  come to me and we agree that the kid's a pest that had ought to  have some strong-arm keep him in order, so we decide to get him  away to a friend of mine who keeps a dogs' hospital down on Long  Island.
 Bud Smithers is the guy to handle that kid.
 You ought to  see him take hold of a dog that's all grouch and ugliness and  make it over into a dog that it's a pleasure to have around.
 I  thought a few weeks with Bud was what the doctor ordered for  Ogden, and Miss Ann guessed I was right, so we had it all framed.
  And now this happens and balls everything up! She can't do  nothing with a husky kid like that without me to help her.
 And  how am I going to help her if I'm not allowed in the house?"    Jimmy was conscious of a renewed admiration for a girl whom he  had always considered a queen among women.
 How rarely in this  world did one find a girl who combined every feminine charm of  mind and body with a resolute determination to raise Cain at the  slightest provocation!    "What an absolutely corking idea!"    Jerry smirked modestly at the approbation, but returned instantly  to his gloom.
    "You get me now? What am I to say to her? She'll be sore!"    "The problem," Jimmy had begun, "is one which, as you suggest,  presents certain--" when there was a knock at the door and the  head of the boarding-house's maid-of-all-work popped in.
    "Mr. Bayliss, is Mr. Mitchell--? Oh, say, Mr. Mitchell, there's a  lady down below wants to see you.
 Says her name's Chester.
"    Jerry looked at Jimmy appealingly.
    "What'll I do?"    "Do nothing," said Jimmy, rising and reaching for his shoes.
  "I'll go down and see her.
 I can explain for you.
"    "It's mighty good of you.
"    "It will be a pleasure.
 Rely on me.
"    Ann, who had returned from her drive shortly after the Ogden  disaster and had instantly proceeded to the boarding-house, had  been shown into the parlour.
 Jimmy found her staring in a rapt  way at a statuette of the Infant Samuel which stood near a bowl  of wax fruit on the mantelpiece.
 She was feeling aggrieved with  Fate and extremely angry with Jerry Mitchell, and she turned at  the sound of the opening door with a militant expression in her  eyes, which changed to one of astonishment on perceiving who it  was that had come in.
    "Mr. Bayliss!"    "Good evening, Miss Chester.
 We, so to speak, meet again.
 I have  come as an intermediary.
 To be brief, Jerry Mitchell daren't face  you, so I offered to come down instead.
"    "But how--but why are you here?"    "I live here.
" He followed her gaze.
 It rested on a picture of  cows in a field.
 "Late American school," he said.
 "Attributed to  the landlady's niece, a graduate of the Wissahickon, Pa.
  Correspondence School of Pictorial Art.
 Said to be genuine.
"    "You _live_ here?" repeated Ann.
 She had been brought up all her  life among the carefully thought out effects of eminent interior  decorators, and the room seemed more dreadful to her than it  actually was.
 "What an awful room!"    "Awful? You must be overlooking the piano.
 Can't you see the  handsome plush cover from where you are standing? Move a little  to the southeast and shade your eyes.
 We get music here of an  evening--when we don't see it coming and sidestep.
"    "Why in the name of goodness do you live here, Mr. Bayliss?"    "Because, Miss Chester, I am infernally hard up! Because the  Bayliss bank-roll has been stricken with a wasting sickness.
"    Ann was looking at him incredulously.
    "But--but--then, did you really mean all that at lunch the other  day? I thought you were joking.
 I took it for granted that you  could get work whenever you wanted to or you wouldn't have made  fun of it like that! Can't you really find anything to do?"    "Plenty to do.
 But I'm not paid for it.
 I walk a great number of  blocks and jump into a great number of cars and dive into  elevators and dive out again and open doors and say 'Good  morning' when people tell me they haven't a job for me.
 My days  are quite full, but my pocket-book isn't!"    Ann had forgotten all about her errand in her sympathy.
    "I'm so sorry.
 Why, it's terrible! I should have thought you  could have found _something_.
"    "I thought the same till the employers of New York in a body told  me I couldn't.
 Men of widely differing views on religion,  politics, and a hundred other points, they were unanimous on  that.
 The nearest I came to being a financial Titan was when I  landed a job in a store on Broadway, demonstrating a patent  collar-clip at ten dollars a week.
 For awhile all Nature seemed  to be shouting 'Ten per! Ten per!' than which there are few  sweeter words in the language.
 But I was fired half-way through  the second day, and Nature changed her act.
"    "But why?"    "It wasn't my fault.
 Just Fate.
 This contrivance was called  Klipstone's Kute Kollar-Klip, and it was supposed to make it easy  for you to fasten your tie.
 My job was to stand in the window in  my shirt-sleeves, gnashing my teeth and registering baffled rage  when I tried the old, obsolete method and beaming on the  multitude when I used the Klip.
 Unfortunately I got the cards  mixed.
 I beamed when I tried the old, obsolete method and nearly  burst myself with baffled fury just after I had exhibited the  card bearing the words 'I will now try Klipstone's Kute Klip.
' I  couldn't think what the vast crowd outside the window was  laughing at till the boss, who chanced to pause on the outskirts  of the gathering on his way back from lunch, was good enough to  tell me.
 Nothing that I could say would convince him that I was  not being intentionally humorous.
 I was sorry to lose the job,  though it did make me feel like a goldfish.
 But talking of being  fired brings us back to Jerry Mitchell.
"    "Oh, never mind Jerry Mitchell now--"    "On the contrary, let us discuss his case and the points arising  from it with care and concentration.
 Jerry Mitchell has told me  all!"    Ann was startled.
    "What do you mean?"    "The word 'all,'" said Jimmy, "is slang for 'everything.
' You see  in me a confidant.
 In a word, I am hep.
"    "You know--?"    "Everything.
 A colloquialism," explained Jimmy, "for 'all.
' About  Ogden, you know.
 The scheme.
 The plot.
 The enterprise.
"    Ann found nothing to say.
    "I am thoroughly in favour of the plan.
 So much so that I propose  to assist you by taking Jerry's place.
"    "I don't understand.
"    "Do you remember at lunch that day, after that remarkable person  had mistaken me for Jimmy Crocker, you suggested in a light,  casual way that if I were to walk into your uncle's office and  claim to be Jimmy Crocker I should be welcomed without a  question? I'm going to do it.
 Then, once aboard the lugger--once  in the house, I am at your orders.
 Use me exactly as you would  have used Jerry Mitchell.
"    "But--but--!"    "Jerry!" said Jimmy scornfully.
 "Can't I do everything that he  could have done? And more.
 A bonehead like Jerry would have been  certain to have bungled the thing somehow.
 I know him well.
 A  good fellow, but in matters requiring intellect and swift thought  dead from the neck up.
 It's a very lucky thing he is out of the  running.
 I love him like a brother, but his dome is of ivory.
  This job requires a man of tact, sense, shrewdness, initiative,  _esprit_, and _verve_.
" He paused.
 "Me!" he concluded.
    "But it's ridiculous! It's out of the question!"    "Not at all.
 I must be extraordinarily like Jimmy Crocker, or  that fellow at the restaurant wouldn't have taken me for him.
  Leave this in my hands.
 I can get away with it.
"    "I shan't dream of allowing you--"    "At nine o'clock to-morrow morning," said Jimmy firmly, "I  present myself at Mr. Pett's office.
 It's all settled.
"    Ann was silent.
 She was endeavouring to adjust her mind to the  idea.
 Her first startled revulsion from it had begun to wane.
 It  was an idea peculiarly suited to her temperament, an idea that  she might have suggested herself if she had thought of it.
 Soon,  from being disapproving, she found herself glowing with  admiration for its author.
 He was a young man of her own sort!    "You asked me on the boat, if you remember," said Jimmy, "if I  had an adventurous soul.
 I am now submitting my proofs.
 You also  spoke highly of America as a land where there were adventures to  be had.
 I now see that you were right.
"    Ann thought for a moment.
    "If I consent to your doing this insane thing, Mr. Bayliss, will  you promise me something?"    "Anything.
"    "Well, in the first place I absolutely refuse to let you risk all  sorts of frightful things by coming into this kidnapping plot.
"  She waved him down, and went on.
 "But I see where you can help me  very much.
 As I told you at lunch, my aunt would do anything for  Jimmy Crocker if he were to appear in New York now.
 I want you to  promise that you will confine your activities to asking her to  let Jerry Mitchell come back.
"    "Never!"    "You said you would promise me anything.
"    "Anything but that.
"    "Then it is all off!"    Jimmy pondered.
    "It's terribly tame that way.
"    "Never mind.
 It's the only way I will consider.
"    "Very well.
 I protest, though.
"    Ann sat down.
    "I think you're splendid, Mr. Bayliss.
 I'm much obliged!"    "Not at all.
"    "It will be such a splendid thing for Ogden, won't it?"    "Admirable.
"    "Now the only thing to do is just to see that we have got  everything straight.
 How about this, for instance? They will ask  you when you arrived in New York.
 How are you going to account  for your delay in coming to see them?"    "I've thought of that.
 There's a boat that docks to-morrow--the  _Caronia_, I think.
 I've got a paper upstairs.
 I'll look it up.
 I  can say I came by her.
"    "That seems all right.
 It's lucky you and uncle Peter never met  on the _Atlantic_.
"    "And now as to my demeanour on entering the home? How should I  behave? Should I be jaunty or humble? What would a long-lost  nephew naturally do?"    "A long-lost nephew with a record like Jimmy Crocker's would  crawl in with a white flag, I should think.
"    A bell clanged in the hall.
    "Supper!" said Jimmy.
 "To go into painful details, New England  boiled dinner, or my senses deceive me, and prunes.
"    "I must be going.
"    "We shall meet at Philippi.
"    He saw her to the door, and stood at the top of the steps  watching her trim figure vanish into the dusk.
 She passed from  his sight.
 Jimmy drew a deep breath, and, thinking hard, went  down the passage to fortify himself with supper.
            JIMMY CATCHES THE BOSS'S EYE    When Jimmy arrived at Mr. Pett's office on Pine Street at  ten-thirty the next morning--his expressed intention of getting  up early enough to be there by nine having proved an empty  boast--he was in a high state of preparedness.
 He had made ready  for what might be a trying interview by substituting a  combination of well-chosen dishes at an expensive hotel for the  less imaginative boarding-house breakfast with which he had of  late been insulting his interior.
 His suit was pressed, his shoes  gleamed brightly, and his chin was smoothly shaven.
 These things,  combined with the perfection of the morning and that vague  exhilaration which a fine day in down-town New York brings to the  man who has not got to work, increased his natural optimism.
  Something seemed to tell him that all would be well.
 He would  have been the last person to deny that his position was a little  complicated--he had to use a pencil and a sheet of paper to show  himself just where he stood--but what of that? A few  complications in life are an excellent tonic for the brain.
 It  was with a sunny geniality which startled that unaccustomed  stripling considerably--and indeed caused him to swallow his  chewing gum--that he handed in his card to Mr. Pett's watchfully  waiting office-boy.
    "This to the boss, my open-faced lad!" he said.
 "Get swiftly off  the mark.
"    The boy departed dumbly.
    From where he stood, outside the barrier which separated visitors  to the office from the workers within, Jimmy could see a vista of  efficient-looking young men with paper protectors round their  cuffs working away at mysterious jobs which seemed to involve the  use of a great deal of paper.
 One in particular was so surrounded  by it that he had the appearance of a bather in surf.
 Jimmy eyed  these toilers with a comfortable and kindly eye.
 All this  industry made him feel happy.
 He liked to think of this sort of  thing going on all round him.
    The office-boy returned.
 "This way, please.
"    The respectfulness of the lad's manner had increased noticeably.
  Mr. Pett's reception of the visitor's name had impressed him.
 It  was an odd fact that the financier, a cipher in his own home,  could impress all sorts of people at the office.
    To Mr. Pett, the announcement that Mr. James Crocker was waiting  to see him had come like the announcement of a miracle.
 Not a day  had passed since their return to America without lamentations  from Mrs. Pett on the subject of their failure to secure the  young man's person.
 The occasion of Mrs. Pett's reading of the  article in the _Sunday Chronicle_ descriptive of the Lord Percy  Whipple affair had been unique in the little man's domestic  history.
 For the first time since he had known her the  indomitable woman had completely broken down.
 Of all sad words of  tongue or pen the saddest are these "It might have been!" and the  thought that, if she had only happened to know it, she had had in  her hands during that interview with her sister in London a  weapon which would have turned defeat into triumph was more than  even Mrs. Pett's strong spirit could endure.
 When she looked back  on that scene and recalled the airy way in which Mrs. Crocker had  spoken of her step-son's "best friend, Lord Percy Whipple" and  realised that at that very moment Lord Percy had been recovering  in bed from the effects of his first meeting with Jimmy Crocker,  the iron entered into her soul and she refused to be comforted.
  In the first instant of realisation she thought of six separate  and distinct things she could have said to her sister, each more  crushing than the last--things which now she would never be able  to say.
    And now, suddenly and unaccountably, the means was at hand for  restoring her to her tranquil self-esteem.
 Jimmy Crocker, despite  what his stepmother had said, probably in active defiance of her  commands, had come to America after all.
 Mr. Pett's first thought  was that his wife would, as he expressed it to himself, be  "tickled to death about this.
" Scarcely waiting for the  office-boy to retire, he leaped towards Jimmy like a gambolling  lamb and slapped him on the back with every evidence of joy and  friendliness.
    "My dear boy!" he cried.
 "My dear boy! I'm delighted to see you!"    Jimmy was surprised, relieved, and pleased.
 He had not expected  this warmth.
 A civil coldness had been the best he had looked  for.
 He had been given to understand that in the Pett home he was  regarded as the black sheep: and, while one may admit a black  sheep into the fold, it does not follow that one must of  necessity fawn upon him.
    "You're very kind," he said, rather startled.
    They inspected each other for a brief moment.
 Mr. Pett was  thinking that Jimmy was a great improvement on the picture his  imagination had drawn of him.
 He had looked for something  tougher, something flashy and bloated.
 Jimmy, for his part, had  taken an instant liking to the financier.
 He, too, had been  misled by imagination.
 He had always supposed that these  millionaires down Wall Street way were keen, aggressive fellows,  with gimlet eyes and sharp tongues.
 On the boat he had only seen  Mr. Pett from afar, and had had no means of estimating his  character.
 He found him an agreeable little man.
    "We had given up all hope of your coming," said Mr. Pett.
    A little manly penitence seemed to Jimmy to be in order.
    "I never expected you would receive me like this.
 I thought I  must have made myself rather unpopular.
"    Mr. Pett buried the past with a gesture.
    "When did you land?" he asked.
    "This morning.
 On the _Caronia_ .
 .
 .
"    "Good passage?"    "Excellent.
"    There was a silence.
 It seemed to Jimmy that Mr. Pett was looking  at him rather more closely than was necessary for the actual  enjoyment of his style of beauty.
 He was just about to throw out  some light remark about the health of Mrs. Pett or something  about porpoises on the voyage to add local colour and  verisimilitude, when his heart missed a beat, as he perceived  that he had made a blunder.
 Like many other amateur plotters, Ann  and he had made the mistake of being too elaborate.
 It had struck  them as an ingenious idea for Jimmy to pretend that he had  arrived that morning, and superficially it was a good idea: but  he now remembered for the first time that, if he had seen Mr.  Pett on the _Atlantic_, the probability was that Mr. Pett had seen  him.
 The next moment the other had confirmed this suspicion.
    "I've an idea I've seen you before.
 Can't think where.
"    "Everybody well at home?" said Jimmy.
    "I'm sure of it.
"    "I'm looking forward to seeing them all.
"    "I've seen you some place.
"    "I'm often there.
"    "Eh?"    Mr. Pett seemed to be turning this remark over in his mind a  trifle suspiciously.
 Jimmy changed the subject.
    "To a young man like myself," he said, "with life opening out  before him, there is something singularly stimulating in the  sight of a modern office.
 How busy those fellows seem!"    "Yes," said Mr. Pett.
 "Yes.
" He was glad that this conversational  note had been struck.
 He was anxious to discuss the future with  this young man.
    "Everybody works but father!" said Jimmy.
    Mr. Pett started.
    "Eh?"    "Nothing.
"    Mr. Pett was vaguely ruffled.
 He suspected insult, but could not  pin it down.
 He abandoned his cheeriness, however, and became the  man of business.
    "I hope you intend to settle down, now that you are here, and  work hard," he said in the voice which he vainly tried to use on  Ogden at home.
    "Work!" said Jimmy blankly.
    "I shall be able to make a place for you in my office.
 That was  my promise to your step-mother, and I shall fulfil it.
"    "But wait a minute! I don't get this! Do you mean to put me to  work?"    "Of course.
 I take it that that was why you came over here,  because you realised how you were wasting your life and wanted a  chance of making good in my office.
"    A hot denial trembled on Jimmy's tongue.
 Never had he been so  misjudged.
 And then the thought of Ann checked him.
 He must do  nothing that would interfere with Ann's plans.
 Whatever the cost,  he must conciliate this little man.
 For a moment he mused  sentimentally on Ann.
 He hoped she would understand what he was  going through for her sake.
 To a man with his ingrained distaste  for work in any shape the sight of those wage-slaves outside  there in the outer office had, as he had told Mr. Pett, been  stimulating: but only because it filled him with a sort of  spiritual uplift to think that he had not got to do that sort of  thing.
 Consider them in the light of fellow-workers, and the  spectacle ceased to stimulate and became nauseating.
 And for her  sake he was about to become one of them! Had any knight of old  ever done anything as big as that for his lady? He very much  doubted it.
    "All right," he said.
 "Count me in.
 I take it that I shall have a  job like one of those out there?"    "Yes.
"    "Not presuming to dictate, I suggest that you give me something  that will take some of the work off that fellow who's swimming in  paper.
 Only the tip of his nose was above the surface as I passed  through.
 I never saw so many fellows working so hard at the same  time in my life.
 All trying to catch the boss's eye, too, I  suppose? It must make you feel like a snipe.
"    Mr. Pett replied stiffly.
 He disliked this levity on the sacred  subject of office work.
 He considered that Jimmy was not  approaching his new life in the proper spirit.
 Many young men had  discussed with him in that room the subject of working in his  employment, but none in quite the same manner.
    "You are at a serious point in your career," he said.
 "You will  have every opportunity of rising.
"    "Yes.
 At seven in the morning, I suppose?"    "A spirit of levity--" began Mr. Pett.
    "I laugh that I may not weep," explained Jimmy.
 "Try to think  what this means to a bright young man who loathes work.
 Be kind  to me.
 Instruct your floor-walkers to speak gently to me at  first.
 It may be a far, far better thing that I do than I have  ever done, but don't ask me to enjoy it! It's all right for you.
  You're the boss.
 Any time you want to call it a day and go off  and watch a ball-game, all you have to do is to leave word that  you have an urgent date to see Mr. Rockerfeller.
 Whereas I shall  have to submerge myself in paper and only come up for air when  the danger of suffocation becomes too great.
"    It may have been the mention of his favourite game that softened  Mr. Pett.
 The frostiness which had crept into his manner thawed.
    "It beats me," he said, "why you ever came over at all, if you  feel like that.
"    "Duty!" said Jimmy.
 "Duty! There comes a time in the life of  every man when he must choose between what is pleasant and what  is right.
"    "And that last fool-game of yours, that Lord Percy Whipple  business, must have made London pretty hot for you?" suggested  Mr. Pett.
    "Your explanation is less romantic than mine, but there is  something in what you say.
"    "Had it occurred to you, young man, that I am taking a chance  putting a fellow like you to work in my office?"    "Have no fear.
 The little bit of work I shall do won't make any  difference.
"    "I've half a mind to send you straight back to London.
"    "Couldn't we compromise?"    "How?"    "Well, haven't you some snug secretarial job you could put me  into? I have an idea that I should make an ideal secretary.
"    "My secretaries work.
"    "I get you.
 Cancel the suggestion.
"    Mr. Pett rubbed his chin thoughtfully.
    "You puzzle me.
 And that's the truth.
"    "Always speak the truth," said Jimmy approvingly.
    "I'm darned if I know what to do with you.
 Well, you'd better  come home with me now, anyway, and meet your aunt, and then we  can talk things over.
 After all, the main thing is to keep you  out of mischief.
"    "You put things crudely, but no doubt you are right.
"    "You'll live with us, of course.
"    "Thank you very much.
 This is the right spirit.
"    "I'll have to talk to Nesta about you.
 There may be something you  can do.
"    "I shouldn't mind being a partner," suggested Jimmy helpfully.
    "Why don't you get work on a paper again? You used to do that  well.
"    "I don't think my old paper would welcome me now.
 They regard me  rather as an entertaining news-item than a worker.
"    "That's true.
 Say, why on earth did you make such a fool of  yourself over on the other side? That breach-of-promise case with  the barmaid!" said Mr. Pett reproachfully.
    "Let bygones be bygones," said Jimmy.
 "I was more sinned against  than sinning.
 You know how it is, uncle Pete!" Mr. Pett started  violently, but said nothing.
 "You try out of pure goodness of  heart to scatter light and sweetness and protect the poor  working-girl--like Heaven--and brighten up her lot and so on, and  she turns right around and soaks it to you good! And anyway she  wasn't a barmaid.
 She worked in a florist's shop.
"    "I don't see that that makes any difference.
"    "All the difference in the world, all the difference between the  sordid and the poetical.
 I don't know if you have ever  experienced the hypnotic intoxication of a florist's shop? Take  it from me, uncle Pete, any girl can look an angel as long as she  is surrounded by choice blooms.
 I couldn't help myself.
 I wasn't  responsible.
 I only woke up when I met her outside.
 But all that  sort of thing is different now.
 I am another man.
 Sober, steady,  serious-minded!"    Mr. Pett had taken the receiver from the telephone and was  talking to some one.
 The buzzing of a feminine voice came to  Jimmy's ears.
 Mr. Pett hung up the receiver.
    "Your aunt says we are to come up at once.
"    "I'm ready.
 And it will be a good excuse for you to knock off  work.
 I bet you're glad I came! Does the carriage await or shall  we take the subway?"    "I guess it will be quicker to take the subway.
 Your aunt's very  surprised that you are here, and very pleased.
"    "I'm making everybody happy to-day.
"    Mr. Pett was looking at him in a meditative way.
 Jimmy caught his  eye.
    "You're registering something, uncle Pete, and I don't know what  it is.
 Why the glance?"    "I was just thinking of something.
"    "Jimmy," prompted his nephew.
    "Eh?"    "Add the word Jimmy to your remarks.
 It will help me to feel at  home and enable me to overcome my shyness.
"    Mr. Pett chuckled.
    "Shyness! If I had your nerve--!" He broke off with a sigh and  looked at Jimmy affectionately.
 "What I was thinking was that  you're a good boy.
 At least, you're not, but you're different  from that gang of--of--that crowd up-town.
"    "What crowd?"    "Your aunt is literary, you know.
 She's filled the house with  poets and that sort of thing.
 It will be a treat having you  around.
 You're human! I don't see that we're going to make much  of you now that you're here, but I'm darned glad you've come,  Jimmy!"    "Put it there, uncle Pete!" said Jimmy.
 "You're all right.
  You're the finest Captain of Industry I ever met!"            SLIGHT COMPLICATIONS    They left the subway at Ninety-sixth Street and walked up the  Drive.
 Jimmy, like every one else who saw it for the first time,  experienced a slight shock at the sight of the Pett mansion, but,  rallying, followed his uncle up the flagged path to the front  door.
    "Your aunt will be in the drawing-room, I guess," said Mr. Pett,  opening the door with his key.
    Jimmy was looking round him appreciatively.
 Mr. Pett's house  might be an eyesore from without, but inside it had had the  benefit of the skill of the best interior decorator in New York.
    "A man could be very happy in a house like this, if he didn't  have to poison his days with work," said Jimmy.
    Mr. Pett looked alarmed.
    "Don't go saying anything like that to your aunt!" he urged.
 "She  thinks you have come to settle down.
"    "So I have.
 I'm going to settle down like a limpet.
 I hope I  shall be living in luxury on you twenty years from now.
 Is this  the room?"    Mr. Pett opened the drawing-room door.
 A small hairy object  sprang from a basket and stood yapping in the middle of the room.
  This was Aida, Mrs. Pett's Pomeranian.
 Mr. Pett, avoiding the  animal coldly, for he disliked it, ushered Jimmy into the room.
    "Here's Jimmy Crocker, Nesta.
"    Jimmy was aware of a handsome woman of middle age, so like his  step-mother that for an instant his self-possession left him and  he stammered.
    "How--how do you do?"    His demeanour made a favourable impression on Mrs. Pett.
 She took  it for the decent confusion of remorse.
    "I was very surprised when your uncle telephoned me," she said.
  "I had not the slightest idea that you were coming over.
 I am  very glad to see you.
"    "Thank you.
"    "This is your cousin, Ogden.
"    Jimmy perceived a fat boy lying on a settee.
 He had not risen on  Jimmy's entrance, and he did not rise now.
 He did not even lower  the book he was reading.
    "Hello," he said.
    Jimmy crossed over to the settee, and looked down on him.
 He had  got over his momentary embarrassment, and, as usual with him, the  reaction led to a fatal breeziness.
 He prodded Ogden in his  well-covered ribs, producing a yelp of protest from that  astounded youth.
    "So this is Ogden! Well, well, well! You don't grow up, Ogden,  but you do grow out.
 What are you--a perfect sixty-six?"    The favourable impression which Mrs. Pett had formed of her  nephew waned.
 She was shocked by this disrespectful attitude  towards the child she worshipped.
    "Please do not disturb Ogden, James," she said stiffly.
 "He is  not feeling very well to-day.
 His stomach is weak.
"    "Been eating too much?" said Jimmy cheerfully.
    "I was just the same at his age.
 What he wants is half rations  and plenty of exercise.
"    "Say!" protested Ogden.
    "Just look at this," proceeded Jimmy, grasping a handful of  superfluous tissue around the boy's ribs.
 "All that ought to come  off.
 I'll tell you what I'll do.
 I'll buy a pair of flannel  trousers and a sweater and some sneakers, and I'll take him for a  run up Riverside Drive this evening.
 Do him no end of good.
 And a  good skipping-rope, too.
 Nothing like it.
 In a couple of weeks  I'll have him as fit as a--"    "Ogden's case," said Mrs. Pett coldly, "which is very  complicated, is in the hands of Doctor Briginshaw, in whom we  have every confidence.
"    There was a silence, the paralysing effects of which Mr. Pett  vainly tried to mitigate by shuffling his feet and coughing.
  Mrs. Pett spoke.
    "I hope that, now that you are here, James, you intend to settle  down and work hard.
"    "Indubitably.
 Like a beaver," said Jimmy, mindful of Mr. Pett's  recent warning.
 "The only trouble is that there seems to be a  little uncertainty as to what I am best fitted for.
 We talked it  over in uncle Pete's office and arrived at no conclusion.
"    "Can't you think of anything?" said Mr. Pett.
    "I looked right through the telephone classified directory the  other day--"    "The other day? But you only landed this morning.
"    "I mean this morning.
 When I was looking up your address so that  I could go and see you," said Jimmy glibly.
 "It seems a long time  ago.
 I think the sight of all those fellows in your office has  aged me.
 I think the best plan would be for me to settle down  here and learn how to be an electrical engineer or something by  mail.
 I was reading an advertisement in a magazine as we came up  on the subway.
 I see they guarantee to teach you anything from  sheet metal working to poultry raising.
 The thing began 'You are  standing still because you lack training.
' It seemed to me to  apply to my case exactly.
 I had better drop them a line to-night  asking for a few simple facts about chickens.
"    Whatever comment Mrs. Pett might have made on this suggestion was  checked by the entrance of Ann.
 From the window of her room Ann  had observed the arrival of Jimmy and her uncle, and now, having  allowed sufficient time to elapse for the former to make Mrs.  Pett's acquaintance, she came down to see how things were going.
    She was well satisfied with what she saw.
 A slight strain which  she perceived in the atmosphere she attributed to embarrassment  natural to the situation.
    She looked at Jimmy enquiringly.
 Mrs. Pett had not informed her  of Mr. Pett's telephone call, so Jimmy, she realised, had to be  explained to her.
 She waited for some one to say something.
    Mr. Pett undertook the introduction.
    "Jimmy, this is my niece, Ann Chester.
 This is Jimmy Crocker,  Ann.
"    Jimmy could not admire sufficiently the start of surprise which  she gave.
 It was artistic and convincing.
    "Jimmy Crocker!"    Mr. Pett was on the point of mentioning that this was not the  first time Ann had met Jimmy, but refrained.
 After all, that  interview had happened five years ago.
 Jimmy had almost certainly  forgotten all about it.
 There was no use in making him feel  unnecessarily awkward.
 It was up to Ann.
 If she wanted to  disinter the ancient grievance, let her.
 It was no business of  his.
    "I thought you weren't coming over!" said Ann.
    "I changed my mind.
"    Mr. Pett, who had been gazing attentively at them, uttered an  exclamation.
    "I've got it! I've been trying all this while to think where it  was that I saw you before.
 It was on the _Atlantic_!"    Ann caught Jimmy's eye.
 She was relieved to see that he was not  disturbed by this sudden development.
    "Did you come over on the _Atlantic_, Mr. Crocker?" she said.
  "Surely not? We crossed on her ourselves.
 We should have met.
"    "Don't call me Mr. Crocker," said Jimmy.
 "Call me Jimmy.
 Your  mother's brother's wife's sister's second husband is my father.
  Blood is thicker than water.
 No, I came over on the _Caronia_.
 We  docked this morning.
"    "Well, there was a fellow just like you on the _Atlantic_,"  persisted Mr. Pett.
    Mrs. Pett said nothing.
 She was watching Jimmy with a keen and  suspicious eye.
    "I suppose I'm a common type," said Jimmy.
    "You remember the man I mean," said Mr. Pett, innocently  unconscious of the unfriendly thoughts he was encouraging in two  of his hearers.
 "He sat two tables away from us at meals.
 You  remember him, Nesta?"    "As I was too unwell to come to meals, I do not.
"    "Why, I thought I saw you once talking to him on deck, Ann.
"    "Really?" said Ann.
 "I don't remember any one who looked at all  like Jimmy.
"    "Well," said Mr. Pett, puzzled.
 "It's very strange.
 I guess I'm  wrong.
" He looked at his watch.
 "Well, I'll have to be getting  back to the office.
"    "I'll come with you part of the way, uncle Pete," said Jimmy.
 "I  have to go and arrange for my things to be expressed here.
"    "Why not phone to the hotel?" said Mr. Pett.
 It seemed to Jimmy  and Ann that he was doing this sort of thing on purpose.
 "Which  hotel did you leave them at?"    "No, I shall have to go there.
 I have some packing to do.
"    "You will be back to lunch?" said Ann.
    "Thanks.
 I shan't be gone more than half an hour.
"    For a moment after they had gone, Ann relaxed, happy and  relieved.
 Everything had gone splendidly.
 Then a shock ran  through her whole system as Mrs. Pett spoke.
 She spoke excitedly,  in a lowered voice, leaning over to Ann.
    "Ann! Did you notice anything? Did you suspect anything?"    Ann mastered her emotion with an effort.
    "Whatever do you mean, aunt Nesta?"    "About that young man, who calls himself Jimmy Crocker.
"    Ann clutched the side of the chair.
    "Who calls himself Jimmy Crocker? I don't understand.
"    Ann tried to laugh.
 It seemed to her an age before she produced  any sound at all, and when it came it was quite unlike a laugh.
    "What put that idea into your head? Surely, if he says he is  Jimmy Crocker, it's rather absurd to doubt him, isn't it? How  could anybody except Jimmy Crocker know that you were anxious to  get Jimmy Crocker over here? You didn't tell any one, did you?"    This reasoning shook Mrs. Pett a little, but she did not intend  to abandon a perfectly good suspicion merely because it began to  seem unreasonable.
    "They have their spies everywhere," she said doggedly.
    "Who have?"    "The Secret Service people from other countries.
 Lord Wisbeach  was telling me about it yesterday.
 He said that I ought to  suspect everybody.
 He said that an attempt might be made on  Willie's invention at any moment now.
"    "He was joking.
"    "He was not.
 I have never seen any one so serious.
 He said that I  ought to regard every fresh person who came into the house as a  possible criminal.
"    "Well, that guy's fresh enough," muttered Ogden from the settee.
    Mrs. Pett started.
    "Ogden! I had forgotten that you were there.
" She uttered a cry  of horror, as the fact of his presence started a new train of  thought.
 "Why, this man may have come to kidnap you! I never  thought of that.
"    Ann felt it time to intervene.
 Mrs. Pett was hovering much too  near the truth for comfort.
 "You mustn't imagine things, aunt  Nesta.
 I believe it comes from writing the sort of stories you  do.
 Surely, it is impossible for this man to be an impostor.
 How  would he dare take such a risk? He must know that you could  detect him at any moment by cabling over to Mrs. Crocker to ask  if her step-son was really in America.
"    It was a bold stroke, for it suggested a plan of action which, if  followed, would mean ruin for her schemes, but Ann could not  refrain from chancing it.
 She wanted to know whether her aunt had  any intention of asking Mrs. Crocker for information, or whether  the feud was too bitter for her pride to allow her to communicate  with her sister in any way.
 She breathed again as Mrs. Pett  stiffened grimly in her chair.
    "I should not dream of cabling to Eugenia.
"    "I quite understand that," said Ann.
 "But an impostor would not  know that you felt like that, would he?"    "I see what you mean.
"    Ann relaxed again.
 The relief was, however, only momentary.
    "I cannot understand, though," said Mrs. Pett, "why your uncle  should have been so positive that he saw this young man on the  _Atlantic_.
"    "Just a chance resemblance, I suppose.
 Why, uncle Peter said he  saw the man whom he imagined was like Jimmy Crocker talking to  me.
 If there had been any real resemblance, shouldn't I have seen  it before uncle Peter?"    Assistance came from an unexpected quarter.
    "I know the chap uncle Peter meant," said Ogden.
 "He wasn't like  this guy at all.
"    Ann was too grateful for the help to feel astonished at it.
 Her  mind, dwelling for a mere instant on the matter, decided that  Ogden must have seen her on deck with somebody else than Jimmy.
  She had certainly not lacked during the voyage for those who  sought her society.
    Mrs. Pett seemed to be impressed.
    "I may be letting my imagination run away with me," she said.
    "Of course you are, aunt Nesta," said Ann thankfully.
 "You don't  realise what a vivid imagination you have got.
 When I was typing  that last story of yours, I was simply astounded at the ideas you  had thought of.
 I remember saying so to uncle Peter.
 You can't  expect to have a wonderful imagination like yours and not imagine  things, can you?"    Mrs. Pett smiled demurely.
 She looked hopefully at her niece,  waiting for more, but Ann had said her say.
    "You are perfectly right, my dear child," she said when she was  quite sure the eulogy was not to be resumed.
 "No doubt I have  been foolish to suspect this young man.
 But Lord Wisbeach's words  naturally acted more strongly on a mind like mine than they would  have done in the case of another woman.
"    "Of course," said Ann.
    She was feeling quite happy now.
 It had been tense while it had  lasted, but everything was all right now.
    "And, fortunately," said Mrs. Pett, "there is a way by which we  can find out for certain if the young man is really James  Crocker.
"    Ann became rigid again.
    "A way? What way?"    "Why, don't you remember, my dear, that Skinner has known James  Crocker for years.
"    "Skinner?"    The name sounded familiar, but in the stress of the moment Ann  could not identify it.
    "My new butler.
 He came to me straight from Eugenia.
 It was he  who let us in when we called at her house.
 Nobody could know  better than he whether this person is really James Crocker or  not.
"    Ann felt as if she had struggled to the limit of her endurance.
  She was not prepared to cope with this unexpected blow.
 She had  not the strength to rally under it.
 Dully she perceived that her  schemes must be dismissed as a failure before they had had a  chance of success.
 Her accomplice must not return to the house to  be exposed.
 She saw that clearly enough.
 If he came back, he  would walk straight into a trap.
 She rose quickly.
 She must warn  him.
 She must intercept him before he arrived--and he might  arrive at any moment now.
    "Of course," she said, steadying herself with an effort, "I never  thought of that.
 That makes it all simple.
 .
 .
 .
 I hope lunch  won't be late.
 I'm hungry.
"    She sauntered to the door, but, directly she had closed it behind  her, ran to her room, snatched up a hat, and rushed downstairs  and out into Riverside Drive.
 Just as she reached the street,  Jimmy turned the corner.
 She ran towards him, holding up her  hands.
            LORD WISBEACH    Jimmy halted in his tracks.
 The apparition had startled him.
 He  had been thinking of Ann, but he had not expected her to bound  out at him, waving her arms.
    "What's the matter?" he enquired.
    Ann pulled him towards a side-street.
    "You mustn't go to the house.
 Everything has gone wrong.
"    "Everything gone wrong? I thought I had made a hit.
 I have with  your uncle, anyway.
 We parted on the friendliest terms.
 We have  arranged to go to the ball-game together to-morrow.
 He is going  to tell them at the office that Carnegie wants to see him.
"    "It isn't uncle Peter.
 It's aunt Nesta.
"    "Ah, there you touch my conscience.
 I was a little tactless, I'm  afraid, with Ogden.
 It happened before you came into the room.
 I  suppose that is the trouble?"    "It has nothing do with that," said Ann impatiently.
 "It's much  worse.
 Aunt Nesta is suspicious.
 She has guessed that you aren't  really Jimmy Crocker.
"    "Great Scott! How?"    "I tried to calm her down, but she still suspects.
 So now she has  decided to wait and see if Skinner, the butler, knows you.
 If he  doesn't, she will know that she was right.
"    Jimmy was frankly puzzled.
    "I don't quite follow the reasoning.
 Surely it's a peculiar kind  of test.
 Why should she think a man cannot be honest and true  unless her butler knows him? There must be hundreds of worthy  citizens whom he does not know.
"    "Skinner arrived from England a few days ago.
 Until then he was  employed by Mrs. Crocker.
 Now do you understand?"    Jimmy stopped.
 She had spoken slowly and distinctly, and there  could be no possibility that he had misunderstood her, yet he  scarcely believed that he had heard her aright.
 How could a man  named Skinner have been his step-mother's butler? Bayliss had  been with the family ever since they had arrived in London.
    "Are you sure?"    "Of course, of course I'm sure.
 Aunt Nesta told me herself.
 There  can't possibly be a mistake, because it was Skinner who let her  in when she called on Mrs. Crocker.
 Uncle Peter told me about it.
  He had a talk with the man in the hall and found that he was a  baseball enthusiast--"    A wild, impossible idea flashed upon Jimmy.
 It was so absurd that  he felt ashamed of entertaining it even for a moment.
 But strange  things were happening these times, and it might be .
 .
 .
    "What sort of looking man is Skinner?"    "Oh, stout, clean-shaven.
 I like him.
 He's much more human than I  thought butlers ever were.
 Why?"    "Oh, nothing.
"    "Of course, you can't go back to the house.
 You see that? He  would say that you aren't Jimmy Crocker and then you would be  arrested.
"    "I don't see that.
 If I am sufficiently like Crocker for his  friends to mistake me for him in restaurants, why shouldn't this  butler mistake me, too?"    "But--?"    "And, consider.
 In any case, there's no harm done.
 If he fails to  recognise me when he opens the door to us, we shall know that the  game is up: and I shall have plenty of time to disappear.
 If the  likeness deceives him, all will be well.
 I propose that we go to  the house, ring the bell, and when he appears, I will say 'Ah,  Skinner! Honest fellow!' or words to that effect.
 He will either  stare blankly at me or fawn on me like a faithful watchdog.
 We  will base our further actions on which way the butler jumps.
"    The sound of the bell died away.
 Footsteps were heard.
 Ann  reached for Jimmy's arm and--clutched it.
    "Now!" she whispered.
    The door opened.
 Next moment Jimmy's suspicion was confirmed.
  Gaping at them from the open doorway, wonderfully respectable and  butlerlike in swallow-tails, stood his father.
 How he came to be  there, and why he was there, Jimmy did not know.
 But there he  was.
    Jimmy had little faith in his father's talents as a man of  discretion.
 The elder Crocker was one of those simple, straight  forward people who, when surprised, do not conceal their  surprise, and who, not understanding any situation in which they  find themselves, demand explanation on the spot.
 Swift and  immediate action was indicated on his part before his amazed  parent, finding him on the steps of the one house in New York  where he was least likely to be, should utter words that would  undo everything.
 He could see the name Jimmy trembling on Mr.  Crocker's lips.
    He waved his hand cheerily.
    "Ah, Skinner, there you are!" he said breezily.
 "Miss Chester was  telling me that you had left my step-mother.
 I suppose you sailed  on the boat before mine.
 I came over on the _Caronia_.
 I suppose  you didn't expect to see me again so soon, eh?"    A spasm seemed to pass over Mr. Crocker's face, leaving it calm  and serene.
 He had been thrown his cue, and like the old actor he  was he took it easily and without confusion.
 He smiled a  respectful smile.
    "No, indeed, sir.
"    He stepped aside to allow them to enter.
 Jimmy caught Ann's eye  as she passed him.
 It shone with relief and admiration, and it  exhilarated Jimmy like wine.
 As she moved towards the stairs, he  gave expression to his satisfaction by slapping his father on the  back with a report that rang out like a pistol shot.
    "What was that?" said Ann, turning.
    "Something out on the Drive, I think," said Jimmy.
 "A car  back-firing, I fancy, Skinner.
"    "Very probably, sir.
"    He followed Ann to the stairs.
 As he started to mount them, a  faint whisper reached his ears.
    "'At-a-boy!"    It was Mr. Crocker's way of bestowing a father's blessing.
    Ann walked into the drawing-room, her head high, triumph in the  glance which she cast upon her unconscious aunt.
    "Quite an interesting little scene downstairs, aunt Nesta," she  said.
 "The meeting of the faithful old retainer and the young  master.
 Skinner was almost overcome with surprise and joy when he  saw Jimmy!"    Mrs. Pett could not check an incautious exclamation.
    "Did Skinner recognise--?" she began; then stopped herself  abruptly.
    Ann laughed.
    "Did he recognise Jimmy? Of course! He was hardly likely to have  forgotten him, surely? It isn't much more than a week since he  was waiting on him in London.
"    "It was a very impressive meeting," said Jimmy.
 "Rather like the  reunion of Ulysses and the hound Argos, of which this bright-eyed  child here--" he patted Ogden on the head, a proceeding violently  resented by that youth--"has no doubt read in the course of his  researches into the Classics.
 I was Ulysses, Skinner enacted the  role of the exuberant dog.
"    Mrs. Pett was not sure whether she was relieved or disappointed  at this evidence that her suspicions had been without foundation.
  On the whole, relief may be said to have preponderated.
    "I have no doubt he was pleased to see you again.
 He must have  been very much astonished.
"    "He was!"    "You will be meeting another old friend in a minute or two," said  Mrs. Pett.
    Jimmy had been sinking into a chair.
 This remark stopped him in  mid-descent.
    "Another!"    Mrs. Pett glanced at the clock.
    "Lord Wisbeach is coming to lunch.
"    "Lord Wisbeach!" cried Ann.
 "He doesn't know Jimmy.
"    "Eugenia informed me in London that he was one of your best  friends, James.
"    Ann looked helplessly at Jimmy.
 She was conscious again of that  feeling of not being able to cope with Fate's blows, of not  having the strength to go on climbing over the barriers which  Fate placed in her path.
    Jimmy, for his part, was cursing the ill fortune that had brought  Lord Wisbeach across his path.
 He saw clearly that it only needed  recognition by one or two more intimates of Jimmy Crocker to make  Ann suspect his real identity.
 The fact that she had seen him  with Bayliss in Paddington Station and had fallen into the error  of supposing Bayliss to be his father had kept her from  suspecting until now; but this could not last forever.
 He  remembered Lord Wisbeach well, as a garrulous, irrepressible  chatterer who would probably talk about old times to such an  extent as to cause Ann to realise the truth in the first five  minutes.
    The door opened.
    "Lord Wisbeach," announced Mr. Crocker.
    "I'm afraid I'm late, Mrs. Pett," said his lordship.
    "No.
 You're quite punctual.
 Lord Wisbeach, here is an old friend  of yours, James Crocker.
"    There was an almost imperceptible pause.
 Then Jimmy stepped  forward and held out his hand.
    "Hello, Wizzy, old man!"    "H-hello, Jimmy!"    Their eyes met.
 In his lordship's there was an expression of  unmistakable relief, mingled with astonishment.
 His face, which  had turned a sickly white, flushed as the blood poured back into  it.
 He had the appearance of a man who had had a bad shock and is  just getting over it.
 Jimmy, eyeing him curiously, was not  surprised at his emotion.
 What the man's game might be, he could  not say; but of one thing he was sure, which was that this was  not Lord Wisbeach, but--on the contrary--some one he had never  seen before in his life.
    "Luncheon is served, madam!" said Mr. Crocker sonorously from the  doorway.
            A LITTLE BUSINESS CHAT    It was not often that Ann found occasion to rejoice at the  presence in her uncle's house of the six geniuses whom Mrs. Pett  had installed therein.
 As a rule, she disliked them individually  and collectively.
 But to-day their company was extraordinarily  welcome to her.
 They might have their faults, but at least their  presence tended to keep the conversation general and prevent it  becoming a duologue between Lord Wisbeach and Jimmy on the  subject of old times.
 She was still feeling weak from the  reaction consequent upon the slackening of the tension of her  emotions on seeing Lord Wisbeach greet Jimmy as an old  acquaintance.
 She had never hoped that that barrier would be  surmounted.
 She had pictured Lord Wisbeach drawing back with a  puzzled frown on his face and an astonished "But this is not  Jimmy Crocker.
" The strain had left her relieved, but in no mood  for conversation, and she replied absently to the remarks of  Howard Bemis, the poet, who sat on her left.
 She looked round the  table.
 Willie Partridge was talking to Mrs. Pett about the  difference between picric acid and trinitrotoluene, than which a  pleasanter topic for the luncheon table could hardly be selected,  and the voice of Clarence Renshaw rose above all other competing  noises, as he spoke of the functions of the trochaic spondee.
  There was nothing outwardly to distinguish this meal from any  other which she had shared of late in that house.
    The only thing that prevented her relief being unmixed was the  fact that she could see Lord Wisbeach casting furtive glances at  Jimmy, who was eating with the quiet concentration of one who,  after days of boarding-house fare, finds himself in the presence  of the masterpieces of a chef.
 In the past few days Jimmy had  consumed too much hash to worry now about anything like a furtive  glance.
 He had perceived Lord Wisbeach's roving eye, and had no  doubt that at the conclusion of the meal he would find occasion  for a little chat.
 Meanwhile, however, his duty was towards his  tissues and their restoration.
 He helped himself liberally from a  dish which his father offered him.
    He became aware that Mrs. Pett was addressing him.
    "I beg your pardon?"    "Quite like old times," said Mrs. Pett genially.
 Her suspicions  had vanished completely since Lord Wisbeach's recognition of the  visitor, and remorse that she should have suspected him made her  unwontedly amiable.
 "Being with Skinner again," she explained.
  "It must remind you of London.
"    Jimmy caught his father's expressionless eye.
    "Skinner's," he said handsomely, "is a character one cannot help  but respect.
 His nature expands before one like some beautiful  flower.
"    The dish rocked in Mr. Crocker's hand, but his face remained  impassive.
    "There is no vice in Skinner," proceeded Jimmy.
 "His heart is the  heart of a little child.
"    Mrs. Pett looked at this paragon of the virtues in rather a  startled way.
 She had an uncomfortable feeling that she was being  laughed at.
 She began to dislike Jimmy again.
    "For many years Skinner has been a father to me," said Jimmy.
  "Who ran to help me when I fell, And would some pretty story  tell, Or kiss the place to make it well? Skinner.
"    For all her suspense, Ann could not help warming towards an  accomplice who carried off an unnerving situation with such a  flourish.
 She had always regarded herself with a fair degree of  complacency as possessed of no mean stock of courage and  resource, but she could not have spoken then without betraying  her anxiety.
 She thought highly of Jimmy, but all the same she  could not help wishing that he would not make himself quite so  conspicuous.
 Perhaps--the thought chilled her--perhaps he was  creating quite a new Jimmy Crocker, a character which would cause  Skinner and Lord Wisbeach to doubt the evidence of their eyes and  begin to suspect the truth.
 She wished she could warn him to  simmer down, but the table was a large one and he and she were at  opposite ends of it.
    Jimmy, meanwhile, was thoroughly enjoying himself.
 He felt that  he was being the little ray of sunshine about the home and making  a good impression.
 He was completely happy.
 He liked the food, he  liked seeing his father buttle, and he liked these amazing freaks  who were, it appeared, fellow-inmates with him of this highly  desirable residence.
 He wished that old Mr. Pett could have been  present.
 He had conceived a great affection for Mr. Pett, and  registered a mental resolve to lose no time in weaning him from  his distressing habit of allowing the office to interfere with  his pleasures.
 He was planning a little trip to the Polo Grounds,  in which Mr. Pett, his father, and a number of pop bottles were  to be his companions, when his reverie was interrupted by a  sudden cessation of the buzz of talk.
 He looked up from his  plate, to find the entire company regarding Willie Partridge  open-mouthed.
 Willie, with gleaming eyes, was gazing at a small  test-tube which he had produced from his pocket and placed beside  his plate.
    "I have enough in this test-tube," said Willie airily, "to blow  half New York to bits.
"    The silence was broken by a crash in the background.
 Mr. Crocker  had dropped a chafing-dish.
    "If I were to drop this little tube like that," said Willie,  using the occurrence as a topical illustration, "we shouldn't be  here.
"    "Don't drop it," advised Jimmy.
 "What is it?"    "Partridgite!"    Mrs. Pett had risen from the table, with blanched face.
    "Willie, how can you bring that stuff here? What are you thinking  of?"    Willie smiles a patronising smile.
    "There is not the slightest danger, aunt Nesta.
 It cannot explode  without concussion.
 I have been carrying it about with me all the  morning.
"    He bestowed on the test-tube the look a fond parent might give  his favourite child.
 Mrs. Pett was not reassured.
    "Go and put it in your uncle's safe at once.
 Put it away.
"    "I haven't the combination.
"    "Call your uncle up at once at the office and ask him.
"    "Very well.
 If you wish it, aunt Nesta.
 But there is no danger.
"    "Don't take that thing with you," screamed Mrs. Pett, as he rose.
  "You might drop it.
 Come back for it.
"    "Very well.
"    Conversation flagged after Willie's departure.
 The presence of  the test-tube seemed to act on the spirits of the company after  the fashion of the corpse at the Egyptian banquet.
 Howard Bemis,  who was sitting next to it, edged away imperceptibly till he  nearly crowded Ann off her chair.
 Presently Willie returned.
 He  picked up the test-tube, put it in his pocket with a certain  jauntiness, and left the room again.
    "Now, if you hear a sudden bang and find yourself disappearing  through the roof," said Jimmy, "that will be it.
"    Willie returned and took his place at the table again.
 But the  spirit had gone out of the gathering.
 The voice of Clarence  Renshaw was hushed, and Howard Bemis spoke no more of the  influence of Edgar Lee Masters on modern literature.
 Mrs. Pett  left the room, followed by Ann.
 The geniuses drifted away one by  one.
 Jimmy, having lighted a cigarette and finished his coffee,  perceived that he was alone with his old friend, Lord Wisbeach,  and that his old friend Lord Wisbeach was about to become  confidential.
    The fair-haired young man opened the proceedings by going to the  door and looking out.
 This done, he returned to his seat and  gazed fixedly at Jimmy.
    "What's your game?" he asked.
    Jimmy returned his gaze blandly.
    "My game?" he said.
 "What do you mean?"    "Can the coy stuff," urged his lordship brusquely.
 "Talk sense  and talk it quick.
 We may be interrupted at any moment.
 What's  your game? What are you here for?"    Jimmy raised his eyebrows.
    "I am a prodigal nephew returned to the fold.
"    "Oh, quit your kidding.
 Are you one of Potter's lot?"    "Who is Potter?"    "You know who Potter is.
"    "On the contrary.
 My life has never been brightened by so much as  a sight of Potter.
"    "Is that true?"    "Absolutely.
"    "Are you working on your own, then?"    "I am not working at all at present.
 There is some talk of my  learning to be an Asparagus Adjuster by mail later on.
"    "You make me sick," said Lord Wisbeach.
 "Where's the sense of  trying to pull this line of talk.
 Why not put your cards on the  table? We've both got in here on the same lay, and there's no use  fighting and balling the thing up.
"    "Do you wish me to understand," said Jimmy, "that you are not my  old friend, Lord Wisbeach?"    "No.
 And you're not my old friend, Jimmy Crocker.
"    "What makes you think that?"    "If you had been, would you have pretended to recognise me  upstairs just now? I tell you, pal, I was all in for a second,  till you gave me the high sign.
"    Jimmy laughed.
    "It would have been awkward for you if I really had been Jimmy  Crocker, wouldn't it?"    "And it would have been awkward for you if I had really been Lord  Wisbeach.
"    "Who are you, by the way?"    "The boys call me Gentleman Jack.
"    "Why?" asked Jimmy, surprised.
    Lord Wisbeach ignored the question.
    "I'm working with Burke's lot just now.
 Say, let's be sensible  about this.
 I'll be straight with you, straight as a string.
"    "Did you say string or spring?"    "And I'll expect you to be straight with me.
"    "Are we to breathe confidences into each other's ears?"    Lord Wisbeach went to the door again and submitted the passage to  a second examination.
    "You seem nervous," said Jimmy.
    "I don't like that butler.
 He's up to something.
"    "Do you think he's one of Potter's lot?"    "Shouldn't wonder.
 He isn't on the level, anyway, or why did he  pretend to recognise you as Jimmy Crocker?"    "Recognition of me as Jimmy Crocker seems to be the acid test of  honesty.
"    "He was in a tight place, same as I was," said Lord Wisbeach.
 "He  couldn't know that you weren't really Jimmy Crocker until you put  him wise--same as you did me--by pretending to know him.
" He  looked at Jimmy with grudging admiration.
 "You'd got your nerve  with you, pal, coming in here like this.
 You were taking big  chances.
 You couldn't have known you wouldn't run up against some  one who really knew Jimmy Crocker.
 What would you have done if  this butler guy had really been on the level?"    "The risks of the profession!"    "When I think of the work I had to put in," said Lord Wisbeach,  "it makes me tired to think of some one else just walking in here  as you did.
"    "What made you choose Lord Wisbeach as your alias?"    "I knew that I could get away with it.
 I came over on the boat  with him, and I knew he was travelling round the world and wasn't  going to stay more than a day in New York.
 Even then I had to go  some to get into this place.
 Burke told me to get hold of old  Chester and get a letter of introduction from him.
 And here you  come along and just stroll in and tell them you have come to  stay!" He brooded for a moment on the injustice of things.
  "Well, what are you going to do about it, Pal?"    "About what?"    "About us both being here? Are you going to be sensible and work  in with me and divvy up later on, or are you going to risk  spoiling everything by trying to hog the whole thing? I'll be  square with you.
 It isn't as if there was any use in trying to  bluff each other.
 We're both here for the same thing.
 You want to  get hold of that powder stuff, that Partridgite, and so do I.
"    "You believe in Partridgite, then?"    "Oh, can it," said Lord Wisbeach disgustedly.
 "What's the use?  Of course I believe in it.
 Burke's had his eye on the thing for a  year.
 You've heard of Dwight Partridge, haven't you? Well, this  guy's his son.
 Every one knows that Dwight Partridge was working  on an explosive when he died, and here's his son comes along with  a test-tube full of stuff which he says could blow this city to  bits.
 What's the answer? The boy's been working on the old man's  dope.
 From what I've seen of him, I guess there wasn't much more  to be done on it, or he wouldn't have done it.
 He's pretty well  dead from the neck up, as far as I can see.
 But that doesn't  alter the fact that he's got the stuff and that you and I have  got to get together and make a deal.
 If we don't, I'm not saying  you mightn't gum my game, just as I might gum yours; but where's  the sense in that? It only means taking extra chances.
 Whereas if  we sit in together, there's enough in it for both of us.
 You know  as well as I do that there's a dozen markets which'll bid against  each other for stuff like that Partridgite.
 If you're worrying  about Burke giving you a square deal, forget it.
 I'll fix Burke.
  He'll treat you nice, all right.
"    Jimmy ground the butt of his cigarette against his plate.
    "I'm no orator, as Brutus is; but, as you know me all, a plain,  blunt man.
 And, speaking in the capacity of a plain, blunt man, I  rise to reply--Nothing doing.
"    "What? You won't come in?"    Jimmy shook his head.
    "I'm sorry to disappoint you, Wizzy, if I may still call you  that, but your offer fails to attract.
 I will not get together or  sit in or anything else.
 On the contrary, I am about to go to  Mrs. Pett and inform her that there is a snake in her Eden.
"    "You're not going to squeal on me?"    "At the top of my voice.
"    Lord Wisbeach laughed unpleasantly.
    "Yes, you will," he said.
 "How are you going to explain why you  recognised me as an old pal before lunch if I'm a crook after  lunch.
 You can't give me away without giving yourself away.
 If  I'm not Lord Wisbeach, then you're not Jimmy Crocker.
"    Jimmy sighed.
 "I get you.
 Life is very complex, isn't it?"    Lord Wisbeach rose.
    "You'd better think it over, son," he said.
 "You aren't going to  get anywhere by acting like a fool.
 You can't stop me going after  this stuff, and if you won't come in and go fifty-fifty, you'll  find yourself left.
 I'll beat you to it.
"    He left the room, and Jimmy, lighting a fresh cigarette,  addressed himself to the contemplation of this new complication  in his affairs.
 It was quite true what Gentleman Jack or Joe or  whatever the "boys" called him had said.
 To denounce him meant  denouncing himself.
 Jimmy smoked thoughtfully.
 Not for the first  time he wished that his record during the past few years had been  of a snowier character.
 He began to appreciate what must have  been the feelings of Dr.
 Jekyll under the handicap of his  disreputable second self, Mr. Hyde.
            MRS.
 PETT TAKES PRECAUTIONS    Mrs. Pett, on leaving the luncheon-table, had returned to the  drawing-room to sit beside the sick-settee of her stricken child.
  She was troubled about Ogden.
 The poor lamb was not at all  himself to-day.
 A bowl of clear soup, the midday meal prescribed  by Doctor Briginshaw, lay untasted at his side.
    She crossed the room softly, and placed a cool hand on her son's  aching brow.
    "Oh, Gee," said Ogden wearily.
    "Are you feeling a little better, Oggie darling?"    "No," said Ogden firmly.
 "I'm feeling a lot worse.
"    "You haven't drunk your nice soup.
"    "Feed it to the cat.
"    "Could you eat a nice bowl of bread-and-milk, precious?"    "Have a heart," replied the sufferer.
    Mrs. Pett returned to her seat, sorrowfully.
 It struck her as an  odd coincidence that the poor child was nearly always like this  on the morning after she had been entertaining guests; she put it  down to the reaction from the excitement working on a  highly-strung temperament.
 To his present collapse the brutal  behaviour of Jerry Mitchell had, of course, contributed.
 Every  drop of her maternal blood boiled with rage and horror whenever  she permitted herself to contemplate the excesses of the late  Jerry.
 She had always mistrusted the man.
 She had never liked his  face--not merely on aesthetic grounds but because she had seemed  to detect in it a lurking savagery.
 How right events had proved  this instinctive feeling.
 Mrs. Pett was not vulgar enough to  describe the feeling, even to herself, as a hunch, but a hunch it  had been; and, like every one whose hunches have proved correct,  she was conscious in the midst of her grief of a certain  complacency.
 It seemed to her that hers must be an intelligence  and insight above the ordinary.
    The peace of the early afternoon settled upon the drawing-room.
  Mrs. Pett had taken up a book; Ogden, on the settee, breathed  stentorously.
 Faint snores proceeded from the basket in the  corner where Aida, the Pomeranian, lay curled in refreshing  sleep.
 Through the open window floated sounds of warmth and  Summer.
    Yielding to the drowsy calm, Mrs. Pett was just nodding into a  pleasant nap, when the door opened and Lord Wisbeach came in.
    Lord Wisbeach had been doing some rapid thinking.
 Rapid thought  is one of the essentials in the composition of men who are known  as Gentleman Jack to the boys and whose livelihood is won only by  a series of arduous struggles against the forces of Society and  the machinations of Potter and his gang.
 Condensed into capsule  form, his lordship's meditations during the minutes after he had  left Jimmy in the dining-room amounted to the realisation that  the best mode of defence is attack.
 It is your man who knows how  to play the bold game on occasion who wins.
 A duller schemer than  Lord Wisbeach might have been content to be inactive after such a  conversation as had just taken place between himself and Jimmy.
  His lordship, giving the matter the concentrated attention of his  trained mind, had hit on a better plan, and he had come to the  drawing-room now to put it into effect.
    His entrance shattered the peaceful atmosphere.
 Aida, who had  been gurgling apoplectically, sprang snarling from the basket,  and made for the intruder open-mouthed.
 Her shrill barking rang  through the room.
    Lord Wisbeach hated little dogs.
 He hated and feared them.
 Many  men of action have these idiosyncrasies.
 He got behind a chair  and said "There, there.
" Aida, whose outburst was mere sound and  fury and who had no intention whatever of coming to blows,  continued the demonstration from a safe distance, till Mrs. Pett,  swooping down, picked her up and held her in her lap, where she  consented to remain, growling subdued defiance.
 Lord Wisbeach  came out from behind his chair and sat down warily.
    "Can I have a word with you, Mrs. Pett?"    "Certainly, Lord Wisbeach.
"    His lordship looked meaningly at Ogden.
    "In private, you know.
"    He then looked meaningly at Mrs. Pett.
    "Ogden darling," said Mrs. Pett, "I think you had better go to  your room and undress and get into bed.
 A little nice sleep might  do you all the good in the world.
"    With surprising docility, the boy rose.
    "All right," he said.
    "Poor Oggie is not at all well to-day," said Mrs. Pett, when he  was gone.
 "He is very subject to these attacks.
 What do you want  to tell me, Lord Wisbeach?"    His lordship drew his chair a little closer.
    "Mrs. Pett, you remember what I told you yesterday?"    "Of course.
"    "Might I ask what you know of this man who has come here calling  himself Jimmy Crocker?"    Mrs. Pett started.
 She remembered that she had used almost that  very expression to Ann.
 Her suspicions, which had been lulled by  the prompt recognition of the visitor by Skinner and Lord  Wisbeach, returned.
 It is one of the effects of a successful  hunch that it breeds other hunches.
 She had been right about  Jerry Mitchell; was she to be proved right about the self-styled  Jimmy Crocker?    "You have seen your nephew, I believe?"    "Never.
 But--"    "That man," said Lord Wisbeach impassively, "is not your nephew.
"    Mrs. Pett thrilled all down her spine.
 She had been right.
    "But you--"    "But I pretended to recognise him? Just so.
 For a purpose.
 I  wanted to make him think that I suspected nothing.
"    "Then you think--?"    "Remember what I said to you yesterday.
"    "But Skinner--the butler--recognised him?"    "Exactly.
 It goes to prove that what I said about Skinner was  correct.
 They are working together.
 The thing is self-evident.
  Look at it from your point of view.
 How simple it is.
 This man  pretends to an intimate acquaintance with Skinner.
 You take that  as evidence of Skinner's honesty.
 Skinner recognises this man.
  You take that as proof that this man is really your nephew.
 The  fact that Skinner recognised as Jimmy Crocker a man who is not  Jimmy Crocker condemns him.
"    "But why did you--?"    "I told you that I pretended to accept this man as the real Jimmy  Crocker for a purpose.
 At present there is nothing that you can  do.
 Mere impersonation is not a crime.
 If I had exposed him when  we met, you would have gained nothing beyond driving him from the  house.
 Whereas, if we wait, if we pretend to suspect nothing, we  shall undoubtedly catch him red-handed in an attempt on your  nephew's invention.
"    "You are sure that that is why he has come?"    "What other reason could he have?"    "I thought he might be trying to kidnap Ogden.
"    Lord Wisbeach frowned thoughtfully.
 He had not taken this  consideration into account.
    "It is possible," he said.
 "There have been several attempts  made, have there not, to kidnap your son?"    "At one time," said Mrs. Pett proudly, "there was not a child in  America who had to be more closely guarded.
 Why, the kidnappers  had a special nick-name for Oggie.
 They called him the Little  Nugget.
"    "Of course, then, it is quite possible that that may be the man's  object.
 In any case, our course must be the same.
 We must watch  every move he makes.
" He paused.
 "I could help--pardon my  suggesting it--I could help a great deal more if you were to  invite me to live in the house.
 You were kind enough to ask me to  visit you in the country, but it will be two weeks before you go  to the Country, and in those two weeks--"    "You must come here at once, Lord Wisbeach.
 To-night.
 To-day.
"    "I think that would be the best plan.
"    "I cannot tell you how grateful I am for all you are doing.
"    "You have been so kind to me, Mrs. Pett," said Lord Wisbeach with  feeling, "that it is surely only right that I should try to make  some return.
 Let us leave it at this then.
 I will come here  to-night and will make it my business to watch these two men.
 I  will go and pack my things and have them sent here.
"    "It is wonderful of you, Lord Wisbeach.
"    "Not at all," replied his lordship.
 "It will be a pleasure.
"    He held out his hand, drawing it back rapidly as the dog Aida  made a snap at it.
 Substituting a long-range leave-taking for the  more intimate farewell, he left the room.
    When he had gone, Mrs. Pett remained for some minutes, thinking.
  She was aflame with excitement.
 She had a sensational mind, and  it had absorbed Lord Wisbeach's revelations eagerly.
 Her  admiration for his lordship was intense, and she trusted him  utterly.
 The only doubt that occurred to her was whether, with  the best intentions in the world, he would be able unassisted to  foil a pair of schemers so distant from each other geographically  as the man who called himself Jimmy Crocker and the man who had  called himself Skinner.
 That was a point on which they had not  touched, the fact that one impostor was above stairs, the other  below.
 It seemed to Mrs. Pett impossible that Lord Wisbeach, for  all his zeal, could watch Skinner without neglecting Jimmy or  foil Jimmy without taking his attention off Skinner.
 It was  manifestly a situation that called for allies.
 She felt that she  must have further assistance.
    To Mrs. Pett, doubtless owing to her hobby of writing sensational  fiction, there was a magic in the word detective which was shared  by no other word in the language.
 She loved detectives--their  keen eyes, their quiet smiles, their Derby hats.
 When they came  on the stage, she leaned forward in her orchestra chair; when  they entered her own stories, she always wrote with a greater  zest.
 It is not too much to say that she had an almost spiritual  attachment for detectives, and the idea of neglecting to employ  one in real life, now that circumstances had combined to render  his advent so necessary, struck her as both rash and inartistic.
  In the old days, when Ogden had been kidnapped, the only thing  which had brought her balm had been the daily interviews with the  detectives.
 She ached to telephone for one now.
    The only consideration that kept her back was a regard for Lord  Wisbeach's feelings.
 He had been so kind and so shrewd that to  suggest reinforcing him with outside assistance must infallibly  wound him deeply.
 And yet the situation demanded the services of  a trained specialist.
 Lord Wisbeach had borne himself during  their recent conversation in such a manner as to leave no doubt  that he considered himself adequate to deal with the matter  single-handed: but admirable though he was he was not a  professional exponent of the art of espionage.
 He needed to be  helped in spite of himself.
    A happy solution struck Mrs. Pett.
 There was no need to tell him.
  She could combine the installation of a detective with the nicest  respect for her ally's feelings by the simple process of engaging  one without telling Lord Wisbeach anything about it.
    The telephone stood at her elbow, concealed--at the express  request of the interior decorator who had designed the room--in  the interior of what looked to the casual eye like a stuffed owl.
  On a table near at hand, handsomely bound in morocco to resemble  a complete works of Shakespeare, was the telephone book.
 Mrs.  Pett hesitated no longer.
 She had forgotten the address of the  detective agency which she had employed on the occasion of the  kidnapping of Ogden, but she remembered the name, and also the  name of the delightfully sympathetic manager or proprietor or  whatever he was who had listened to her troubles then.
    She unhooked the receiver, and gave a number.
    "I want to speak to Mr. Sturgis," she said.
    "Oh, Mr. Sturgis," said Mrs. Pett.
 "I wonder if you could  possibly run up here--yes, now.
 This is Mrs. Peter Pett speaking.
  You remember we met some years ago when I was Mrs. Ford.
 Yes, the  mother of Ogden Ford.
 I want to consult--You will come up at  once? Thank you so much.
 Good-bye.
"    Mrs. Pett hung up the receiver.
            MISS TRIMBLE, DETECTIVE    Downstairs, in the dining-room, Jimmy was smoking cigarettes and  reviewing in his mind the peculiarities of the situation, when  Ann came in.
    "Oh, there you are," said Ann.
 "I thought you must have gone  upstairs.
"    "I have been having a delightful and entertaining conversation  with my old chum, Lord Wisbeach.
"    "Good gracious! What about?"    "Oh, this and that.
"    "Not about old times?"    "No, we did not touch upon old times.
"    "Does he still believe that you are Jimmy Crocker? I'm so  nervous," said Ann, "that I can hardly speak.
"    "I shouldn't be nervous," said Jimmy encouragingly.
 "I don't see  how things could be going better.
"    "That's what makes me nervous.
 Our luck is too good to last.
 We  are taking such risks.
 It would have been bad enough without  Skinner and Lord Wisbeach.
 At any moment you may make some fatal  slip.
 Thank goodness, aunt Nesta's suspicions have been squashed  for the time being now that Skinner and Lord Wisbeach have  accepted you as genuine.
 But then you have only seen them for a  few minutes.
 When they have been with you a little longer, they  may get suspicious themselves.
 I can't imagine how you managed to  keep it up with Lord Wisbeach.
 I should have thought he would be  certain to say something about the time when you were supposed to  be friends in London.
 We simply mustn't strain our luck.
 I want  you to go straight to aunt Nesta now and ask her to let Jerry  come back.
"    "You still refuse to let me take Jerry's place?"    "Of course I do.
 You'll find aunt Nesta upstairs.
"    "Very well.
 But suppose I can't persuade her to forgive Jerry?"    "I think she is certain to do anything you ask.
 You saw how  friendly she was to you at lunch.
 I don't see how anything can  have happened since lunch to change her.
"    "Very well.
 I'll go to her now.
"    "And when you have seen her, go to the library and wait for me.
  It's the second room along the passage outside here.
 I have  promised to drive Lord Wisbeach down to his hotel in my car.
 I  met him outside just now and he tells me aunt Nesta has invited  him to stay here, so he wants to go and get his things ready.
 I  shan't be twenty minutes.
 I shall come straight back.
"    Jimmy found himself vaguely disquieted by this piece of  information.
    "Lord Wisbeach is coming to stay here?"    "Yes.
 Why?"    "Oh, nothing.
 Well, I'll go and see Mrs. Pett.
"    No traces of the disturbance which had temporarily ruffled the  peace of the drawing-room were to be observed when Jimmy reached  it.
 The receiver of the telephone was back on its hook, Mrs. Pett  back in her chair, the dog Aida back in her basket.
 Mrs. Pett,  her mind at ease now that she had taken the step of summoning Mr.  Sturgis, was reading a book, one of her own, and was absorbed in  it.
 The dog Aida slumbered noisily.
    The sight of Jimmy, however, roused Mrs. Pett from her literary  calm.
 To her eye, after what Lord Wisbeach had revealed there was  something sinister in the very way in which he walked into the  room.
 He made her flesh creep.
 In "A Society Thug" (Mobbs and  Stifien, $1.
35 net, all rights of translation reserved, including  the Scandinavian) she had portrayed just such a man--smooth,  specious, and formidable.
 Instinctively, as she watched Jimmy,  her mind went back to the perfectly rotten behaviour of her own  Marsden Tuke (it was only in the last chapter but one that they  managed to foil his outrageous machinations), and it seemed to  her that here was Tuke in the flesh.
 She had pictured him, she  remembered, as a man of agreeable exterior, the better calculated  to deceive and undo the virtuous; and the fact that Jimmy was a  presentable-looking young man only made him appear viler in her  eyes.
 In a word, she could hardly have been in less suitable  frame of mind to receive graciously any kind of a request from  him.
 She would have suspected ulterior motives if he had asked  her the time.
    Jimmy did not know this.
 He thought that she eyed him a trifle  frostily, but he did not attribute this to any suspicion of him.
  He tried to ingratiate himself by smiling pleasantly.
 He could  not have made a worse move.
 Marsden Tuke's pleasant smile had  been his deadliest weapon.
 Under its influence deluded people had  trusted him alone with their jewellery and what not.
    "Aunt Nesta," said Jimmy, "I wonder if I might ask you a personal  favour.
"    Mrs. Pett shuddered at the glibness with which he brought out the  familiar name.
 This was superTuke.
 Marsden himself, scoundrel as  he was, could not have called her "Aunt Nesta" as smoothly as  that.
    "Yes?" she said at last.
 She found it difficult to speak.
    "I happened to meet an old friend of mine this morning.
 He was  very sorry for himself.
 It appears that--for excellent reasons,  of course--you had dismissed him.
 I mean Jerry Mitchell.
"    Mrs. Pett was now absolutely appalled.
 The conspiracy seemed to  grow more complicated every moment.
 Already its ramifications  embraced this man before her, a trusted butler, and her husband's  late physical instructor.
 Who could say where it would end? She  had never liked Jerry Mitchell, but she had never suspected him  of being a conspirator.
 Yet, if this man who called himself Jimmy  Crocker was an old friend of his, how could he be anything else?    "Mitchell," Jimmy went on, unconscious of the emotions which his  every word was arousing in his hearer's bosom, "told me about  what happened yesterday.
 He is very depressed.
 He said he could  not think how he happened to behave in such an abominable way.
 He  entreated me to put in a word for him with you.
 He begged me to  tell you how he regretted the brutal assault, and asked me to  mention the fact that his record had hitherto been blameless.
"  Jimmy paused.
 He was getting no encouragement, and seemed to be  making no impression whatever.
 Mrs. Pett was sitting bolt upright  in her chair in a stiffly defensive sort of way.
 She had the  appearance of being absolutely untouched by his eloquence.
 "In  fact," he concluded lamely, "he is very sorry.
"    There was silence for a moment.
    "How do you come to know Mitchell?" asked Mrs. Pett.
    "We knew each other when I was over here working on the  _Chronicle_.
 I saw him fight once or twice.
 He is an excellent  fellow, and used to have a right swing that was a pippin--I  should say extremely excellent.
 Brought it up from the floor, you  know.
"    "I strongly object to prize-fighters," said Mrs. Pett, "and I was  opposed to Mitchell coming into the house from the first.
"    "You wouldn't let him come back, I suppose?" queried Jimmy  tentatively.
    "I would not.
 I would not dream of such a thing.
"    "He's full of remorse, you know.
"    "If he has a spark of humanity, I have no doubt of it.
"    Jimmy paused.
 This thing was not coming out as well as it might  have done.
 He feared that for once in her life Ann was about to  be denied something on which she had set her heart.
 The  reflection that this would be extremely good for her competed for  precedence in his mind with the reflection that she would  probably blame him for the failure, which would be unpleasant.
    "He is very fond of Ogden really.
"    "H'm," said Mrs. Pett.
    "I think the heat must have made him irritable.
 In his normal  state he would not strike a lamb.
 I've known him to do it.
"    "Do what?"    "Not strike lambs.
"    "Isch," said Mrs. Pett--the first time Jimmy had ever heard that  remarkable monosyllable proceed from human lips.
 He took  it--rightly--to be intended to convey disapproval, scepticism,  and annoyance.
 He was convinced that this mission was going to be  one of his failures.
    "Then I may tell him," he said, "that it's all right?"    "That what is all right?"    "That he may come back here?"    "Certainly not.
"    Mrs. Pett was not a timid woman, but she could not restrain a  shudder as she watched the plot unfold before her eyes.
 Her  gratitude towards Lord Wisbeach at this point in the proceedings  almost became hero-worship.
 If it had not been for him and his  revelations concerning this man before her, she would certainly  have yielded to the request that Jerry Mitchell be allowed to  return to the house.
 Much as she disliked Jerry, she had been  feeling so triumphant at the thought of Jimmy Crocker coming to  her in spite of his step-mother's wishes and so pleased at having  unexpectedly got her own way that she could have denied him  nothing that he might have cared to ask.
 But now it was as if,  herself unseen, she were looking on at a gang of conspirators  hatching some plot.
 She was in the strong strategic position of  the person who is apparently deceived, but who in reality knows  all.
    For a moment she considered the question of admitting Jerry to  the house.
 Evidently his presence was necessary to the  consummation of the plot, whatever it might be, and it occurred  to her that it might be as well, on the principle of giving the  schemers enough rope to hang themselves with, to let him come  back and play his part.
 Then she reflected that, with the  self-styled Jimmy Crocker as well as the fraudulent Skinner in  the house, Lord Wisbeach and the detective would have their hands  quite full enough.
 It would be foolish to complicate matters.
  She glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece.
 Mr. Sturgis would be  arriving soon, if he had really started at once from his office,  as he had promised.
 She drew comfort from the imminence of his  coming.
 It would be pleasant to put herself in the hands of an  expert.
    Jimmy had paused, mid-way to the door, and was standing there as  if reluctant to accept her answer to his plea.
    "It would never occur again.
 What happened yesterday, I mean.
 You  need not be afraid of that.
"    "I am not afraid of that," responded Mrs. Pett tartly.
    "If you had seen him when I did--"    "When did you? You landed from the boat this morning, you went to  Mr. Pett's office, and then came straight up here with him.
 I am  interested to know when you did see Mitchell?"    She regretted this thrust a little, for she felt it might put the  man on his guard by showing that she suspected something but she  could not resist it, and it pleased her to see that her companion  was momentarily confused.
    "I met him when I was going for my luggage," said Jimmy.
    It was just the way Marsden Tuke would have got out of it.
 Tuke  was always wriggling out of corners like that.
 Mrs. Pett's horror  of Jimmy grew.
    "I told him, of course," said Jimmy, "that you had very kindly  invited me to stay with you, and he told me all, about his  trouble and implored me to plead for him.
 If you had seen him  when I did, all gloom and repentance, you would have been sorry  for him.
 Your woman's heart--"    Whatever Jimmy was about to say regarding Mrs. Pett's woman's  heart was interrupted by the opening of the door and the deep,  respectful voice of Mr. Crocker.
    "Mr. Sturgis.
"    The detective entered briskly, as if time were money with him--as  indeed it was, for the International Detective Agency, of which  he was the proprietor, did a thriving business.
 He was a gaunt,  hungry-looking man of about fifty, with sunken eyes and thin  lips.
 It was his habit to dress in the height of fashion, for one  of his favourite axioms was that a man might be a detective and  still look a gentleman, and his appearance was that of the  individual usually described as a "popular clubman.
" That is to  say, he looked like a floorwalker taking a Sunday stroll.
 His  prosperous exterior deceived Jimmy satisfactorily, and the latter  left the room little thinking that the visitor was anything but  an ordinary caller.
    The detective glanced keenly at him as he passed.
 He made a  practice of glancing keenly at nearly everything.
 It cost nothing  and impressed clients.
    "I am so glad you have come, Mr. Sturgis," said Mrs. Pett.
 "Won't  you sit down?"    Mr. Sturgis sat down, pulled up the knees of his trousers that  half-inch which keeps them from bagging and so preserves the  gentlemanliness of the appearance, and glanced keenly at Mrs.  Pett.
    "Who was that young man who just went out?"    "It is about him that I wished to consult you, Mr. Sturgis.
"    Mr. Sturgis leaned back, and placed the tips of his fingers  together.
    "Tell me how he comes to be here.
"    "He pretends that he is my nephew, James Crocker.
"    "Your nephew? Have you never seen your nephew?"    "Never.
 I ought to tell you, that a few years ago my sister  married for the second time.
 I disapproved of the marriage, and  refused to see her husband or his son--he was a widower.
 A few  weeks ago, for private reasons, I went over to England, where  they are living, and asked my sister to let the boy come here to  work in my husband's office.
 She refused, and my husband and I  returned to New York.
 This morning I was astonished to get a  telephone call from Mr. Pett from his office, to say that James  Crocker had unexpectedly arrived after all, and was then at the  office.
 They came up here, and the young man seemed quite  genuine.
 Indeed, he had an offensive jocularity which would be  quite in keeping with the character of the real James Crocker,  from what I have heard of him.
"    Mr. Sturgis nodded.
    "Know what you mean.
 Saw that thing in the paper," he said  briefly.
 "Yes?"    "Now, it is very curious, but almost from the start I was uneasy.
  When I say that the young man seemed genuine, I mean that he  completely deceived my husband and my niece, who lives with us.
  But I had reasons, which I need not go into now, for being on my  guard, and I was suspicious.
 What aroused my suspicion was the  fact that my husband thought that he remembered this young man as  a fellow-traveller of ours on the _Atlantic_, on our return voyage,  while he claimed to have landed that morning on the _Caronia_.
"    "You are certain of that, Mrs. Pett? He stated positively that he  had landed this morning?"    "Yes.
 Quite positively.
 Unfortunately I myself had no chance of  judging the truth of what he said, as I am such a bad sailor that  I was seldom out of my stateroom from beginning to end of the  voyage.
 However, as I say, I was suspicious.
 I did not see how I  could confirm my suspicions, until I remembered that my new  butler, Skinner, had come straight from my sister's house.
"    "That is the man who just admitted me?"    "Exactly.
 He entered my employment only a few days ago, having  come direct from London.
 I decided to wait until Skinner should  meet this young man.
 Of course, when he first came into the  house, he was with my husband, who opened the door with his key,  so that they did not meet then.
"    "I understand," said Mr. Sturgis, glancing keenly at the dog  Aida, who had risen and was sniffing at his ankles.
 "You thought  that if Skinner recognised this young man, it would be proof of  his identity?"    "Exactly.
"    "Did he recognise him?"    "Yes.
 But wait.
 I have not finished.
 He recognised him, and for  the moment I was satisfied.
 But I had had my suspicions of  Skinner, too.
 I ought to tell you that I had been warned against  him by a great friend of mine, Lord Wisbeach, an English peer  whom we have known intimately for a very long time.
 He is one of  the Shropshire Wisbeaches, you know.
"    "No doubt," said Mr. Sturgis.
    "Lord Wisbeach used to be intimate with the real Jimmy Crocker.
  He came to lunch to-day and met this impostor.
 He pretended to  recognise him, in order to put him off his guard, but after lunch  he came to me here and told me that in reality he had never seen  him before in his life, and that, whoever else he might be, he  was certainly not James Crocker, my nephew.
"    She broke off and looked at Mr. Sturgis expectantly.
 The  detective smiled a quiet smile.
    "And even that is not all.
 There is another thing.
 Mr. Pett used  to employ as a physical instructor a man named Jerry Mitchell.
  Yesterday I dismissed him for reasons it is not necessary to go  into.
 To-day--just as you arrived in fact--the man who calls  himself Jimmy Crocker was begging me to allow Mitchell to return  to the house and resume his work here.
 Does that not strike you  as suspicious, Mr. Sturgis?"    The detective closed his eyes, and smiled his quiet smile again.
  He opened his eyes, and fixed them on Mrs. Pett.
    "As pretty a case as I have come across in years," he said.
 "Mrs.  Pett, let me tell you something.
 It is one of my peculiarities  that I never forget a face.
 You say that this young man pretends  to have landed this morning from the _Caronia_? Well, I saw him  myself more than a week ago in a Broadway _cafe_.
"    "You did?"    "Talking to--Jerry Mitchell.
 I know Mitchell well by sight.
"    Mrs. Pett uttered an exclamation.
    "And this butler of yours--Skinner.
 Shall I tell you something  about him? You perhaps know that when the big detective agencies,  Anderson's and the others, are approached in the matter of  tracing a man who is wanted for anything they sometimes ask the  smaller agencies like my own to work in with them.
 It saves time  and widens the field of operations.
 We are very glad to do  Anderson's service, and Anderson's are big enough to be able to  afford to let us do it.
 Now, a few days ago, a friend of mine in  Anderson's came to me with a sheaf of photographs, which had been  sent to them from London.
 Whether some private client in London  or from Scotland Yard I do not know.
 Nor do I know why the  original of the photograph was wanted.
 But Anderson's had been  asked to trace him and make a report.
 My peculiar gift for  remembering faces has enabled me to oblige the Anderson people  once or twice before in this way.
 I studied the photographs very  carefully, and kept two of them for reference.
 I have one with me  now.
" He felt in his pockets.
 "Do you recognise it?"    Mrs. Pett stared at the photograph.
 It was the presentment of a  stout, good-humoured man of middle-age, whose solemn gaze dwelt  on the middle distance in that fixed way which a man achieves  only in photographs.
    "Skinner!"    "Exactly," said Mr. Sturgis, taking the photograph from her and  putting it back in his pocket.
 "I recognised him directly he  opened the door to me.
"    "But--but I am almost certain that Skinner is the man who let me  in when I called on my sister in London.
"    "_Almost_," repeated the detective.
 "Did you observe him very  closely?"    "No.
 I suppose I did not.
"    "The type is a very common one.
 It would be very easy indeed for  a clever crook to make himself up as your sister's butler closely  enough to deceive any one who had only seen the original once and  for a short time then.
 What their game is I could not say at  present, but, taking everything into consideration, there can be  no doubt whatever that the man who calls himself your nephew and  the man who calls himself your sister's butler are working  together, and that Jerry Mitchell is working in with them.
 As I  say, I cannot tell you what they are after at present, but there  is no doubt that your unexpected dismissal of Mitchell must have  upset their plans.
 That would account for the eagerness to get  him back into the house again.
"    "Lord Wisbeach thought that they were trying to steal my nephew's  explosive.
 Perhaps you have read in the papers that my nephew,  Willie Partridge, has completed an explosive which is more  powerful than any at present known.
 His father--you have heard of  him, of course--Dwight Partridge.
"    Mr. Sturgis nodded.
    "His father was working on it at the time of his death, and  Willie has gone on with his experiments where he left off.
 To-day  at lunch he showed us a test-tube full of the explosive.
 He put  it in my husband's safe in the library.
 Lord Wisbeach is  convinced that these scoundrels are trying to steal this, but I  cannot help feeling that this is another of those attempts to  kidnap my son Ogden.
 What do you think?"    "It is impossible to say at this stage of the proceedings.
 All we  can tell is that there is some plot going on.
 You refused, of  course, to allow Mitchell to come back to the house?"    "Yes.
 You think that was wise?"    "Undoubtedly.
 If his absence did not handicap them, they would  not be so anxious to have him on the spot.
"    "What shall we do?"    "You wish me to undertake the case?"    "Of course.
"    Mr. Sturgis frowned thoughtfully.
    "It would be useless for me to come here myself.
 By bad luck the  man who pretends to be your nephew has seen me.
 If I were to come  to stay here, he would suspect something.
 He would be on his  guard.
" He pondered with closed eyes.
 "Miss Trimble," he  exclaimed.
    "I beg your pardon.
"    "You want Miss Trimble.
 She is the smartest worker in my office.
  This is precisely the type of case she could handle to  perfection.
"    "A woman?" said Mrs. Pett doubtfully.
    "A woman in a thousand," said Mr. Sturgis.
 "A woman in a  million.
"    "But physically would a woman be--?"    "Miss Trimble knows more about jiu-jitsu than the Japanese  professor who taught her.
 At one time she was a Strong Woman in  small-time vaudeville.
 She is an expert revolver-shot.
 I am not  worrying about Miss Trimble's capacity to do the work.
 I am only  wondering in what capacity it would be best for her to enter the  house.
 Have you a vacancy for a parlour-maid?"    "I could make one.
"    "Do so at once.
 Miss Trimble is at her best as a parlour-maid.
  She handled the Marling divorce case in that capacity.
 Have you a  telephone in the room?"    Mrs. Pett opened the stuffed owl.
 The detective got in touch with  his office.
    "Mr. Sturgis speaking.
 Tell Miss Trimble to come to the phone.
  .
 .
 .
 Miss Trimble? I am speaking from Mrs. Pett's on Riverside  Drive.
 You know the house? I want you to come up at once.
 Take a  taxi.
 Go to the back-door and ask to see Mrs. Pett.
 Say you have  come about getting a place here as a maid.
 Understand? Right.
  Say, listen, Miss Trimble.
 Hello? Yes, don't hang up for a  moment.
 Do you remember those photographs I showed you yesterday?  Yes, the photographs from Anderson's.
 I've found the man.
 He's  the butler here.
 Take a look at him when you get to the house.
  Now go and get a taxi.
 Mrs. Pett will explain everything when you  arrive.
" He hung up the receiver.
 "I think I had better go now,  Mrs. Pett.
 It would not do for me to be here while these fellows  are on their guard.
 I can safely leave the matter to Miss  Trimble.
 I wish you good afternoon.
"    After he had gone, Mrs. Pett vainly endeavoured to interest  herself again in her book, but in competition with the sensations  of life, fiction, even though she had written it herself, had  lost its power and grip.
 It seemed to her that Miss Trimble must  be walking to the house instead of journeying thither in a  taxi-cab.
 But a glance at the clock assured her that only five  minutes had elapsed since the detective's departure.
 She went to  the window and looked out.
 She was hopelessly restless.
    At last a taxi-cab stopped at the corner, and a young woman got  out and walked towards the house.
 If this were Miss Trimble, she  certainly looked capable.
 She was a stumpy, square-shouldered  person, and even at that distance it was possible to perceive  that she had a face of no common shrewdness and determination.
  The next moment she had turned down the side-street in the  direction of the back-premises of Mrs. Pett's house: and a few  minutes later Mr. Crocker presented himself.
    "A young person wishes to see you, madam.
 A young person of the  name of Trimble.
" A pang passed through Mrs. Pett as she listened  to his measured tones.
 It was tragic that so perfect a butler  should be a scoundrel.
 "She says that you desired her to call in  connection with a situation.
"    "Show her up here, Skinner.
 She is the new parlour-maid.
 I will  send her down to you when I have finished speaking to her.
"    "Very good, madam.
"    There seemed to Mrs. Pett to be a faint touch of defiance in Miss  Trimble's manner as she entered the room.
 The fact was that Miss  Trimble held strong views on the equal distribution of property,  and rich people's houses always affected her adversely.
 Mr.  Crocker retired, closing the door gently behind him.
    A meaning sniff proceeded from Mrs. Pett's visitor as she looked  round at the achievements of the interior decorator, who had  lavished his art unsparingly in this particular room.
 At this  close range she more than fulfilled the promise of that distant  view which Mrs. Pett had had of her from the window.
 Her face was  not only shrewd and determined: it was menacing.
 She had thick  eyebrows, from beneath which small, glittering eyes looked out  like dangerous beasts in undergrowth: and the impressive effect  of these was accentuated by the fact that, while the left eye  looked straight out at its object, the right eye had a sort of  roving commission and was now, while its colleague fixed Mrs.  Pett with a gimlet stare, examining the ceiling.
 As to the rest  of the appearance of this remarkable woman, her nose was stubby  and aggressive, and her mouth had the coldly forbidding look of  the closed door of a subway express when you have just missed the  train.
 It bade you keep your distance on pain of injury.
 Mrs.  Pett, though herself a strong woman, was conscious of a curious  weakness as she looked at a female of the species so much  deadlier than any male whom she had ever encountered: and came  near feeling a half-pity for the unhappy wretches on whom this  dynamic maiden was to be unleashed.
 She hardly knew how to open  the conversation.
    Miss Trimble, however, was equal to the occasion.
 She always  preferred to open conversations herself.
 Her lips parted, and  words flew out as if shot from a machine-gun.
 As far as Mrs.  Pett could observe, she considered it unnecessary to part her  teeth, preferring to speak with them clenched.
 This gave an  additional touch of menace to her speech.
    "Dafternoon," said Miss Trimble, and Mrs. Pett backed  convulsively into the padded recesses of her chair, feeling as if  somebody had thrown a brick at her.
    "Good afternoon," she said faintly.
    "Gladda meecher, siz Pett.
 Mr. Sturge semme up.
 Said y'ad job f'r  me.
 Came here squick scould.
"    "I beg your pardon?"    "Squick scould.
 Got slow taxi.
"    "Oh, yes.
"    Miss Trimble's right eye flashed about the room like a  searchlight, but she kept the other hypnotically on her  companion's face.
    "Whass trouble?" The right eye rested for a moment on a  magnificent Corot over the mantelpiece, and she snifted again.
  "Not s'prised y'have trouble.
 All rich people 've trouble.
 Noth'  t'do with their time 'cept get 'nto trouble.
"    She frowned disapprovingly at a Canaletto.
    "You--ah--appear to dislike the rich," said Mrs. Pett, as nearly  in her grand manner as she could contrive.
    Miss Trimble bowled over the grand manner as if it had been a  small fowl and she an automobile.
 She rolled over it and squashed  it flat.
    "Hate 'em! Sogelist!"    "I beg your pardon," said Mrs. Pett humbly.
 This woman was  beginning to oppress her to an almost unbelievable extent.
    "Sogelist! No use f'r idle rich.
 Ev' read B'nard Shaw? Huh? Or  Upton Sinclair? Uh? Read'm.
 Make y'think a bit.
 Well, y'haven't  told me whasser trouble.
"    Mrs. Pett was by this time heartily regretting the impulse which  had caused her to telephone to Mr. Sturgis.
 In a career which had  had more than its share of detectives, both real and fictitious,  she had never been confronted with a detective like this.
 The  galling thing was that she was helpless.
 After all, one engaged a  detective for his or her shrewdness and efficiency, not for  suavity and polish.
 A detective who hurls speech at you through  clenched teeth and yet detects is better value for the money than  one who, though an ideal companion for the drawing-room, is  incompetent: and Mrs. Pett, like most other people,  subconsciously held the view that the ruder a person is the more  efficient he must be.
 It is but rarely that any one is found who  is not dazzled by the glamour of incivility.
 She crushed down her  resentment at her visitor's tone, and tried to concentrate her  mind on the fact that this was a business matter and that what  she wanted was results rather than fair words.
 She found it  easier to do this when looking at the other's face.
 It was a  capable face.
 Not beautiful, perhaps, but full of promise of  action.
 Miss Trimble having ceased temporarily to speak, her  mouth was in repose, and when her mouth was in repose it looked  more efficient than anything else of its size in existence.
    "I want you," said Mrs. Pett, "to come here and watch some men--"    "Men! Thought so! Wh' there's trouble, always men't bottom'f it!"    "You do not like men?"    "Hate 'em! Suff-gist!" She looked penetratingly at Mrs. Pett.
  Her left eye seemed to pounce out from under its tangled brow.
  "You S'porter of th' Cause?"    Mrs. Pett was an anti-Suffragist, but, though she held strong  opinions, nothing would have induced her to air them at that  moment.
 Her whole being quailed at the prospect of arguing with  this woman.
 She returned hurriedly to the main theme.
    "A young man arrived here this morning, pretending to be my  nephew, James Crocker.
 He is an impostor.
 I want you to watch him  very carefully.
"    "Whassiz game?"    "I do not know.
 Personally I think he is here to kidnap my son  Ogden.
"    "I'll fix'm," said the fair Trimble confidently.
 "Say, that  butler 'f yours.
 He's a crook!"    Mrs. Pett opened her eyes.
 This woman was manifestly competent at  her work.
    "Have you found that out already?"    "D'rectly saw him.
" Miss Trimble opened her purse.
 "Go' one 'f  his photographs here.
 Brought it from office.
 He's th' man that's  wanted 'll right.
"    "Mr. Sturgis and I both think he is working with the other man,  the one who pretends to be my nephew.
"    "Sure.
 I'll fix 'm.
"    She returned the photograph to her purse and snapped the catch  with vicious emphasis.
    "There is another possibility," said Mrs. Pett.
 "My nephew, Mr.  William Partridge, had invented a wonderful explosive, and it is  quite likely that these men are here to try to steal it.
"    "Sure.
 Men'll do anything.
 If y' put all the men in th' world in  th' cooler, wouldn't be 'ny more crime.
"    She glowered at the dog Aida, who had risen from the basket and  removing the last remains of sleep from her system by a series of  calisthenics of her own invention, as if she suspected her of  masculinity.
 Mrs. Pett could not help wondering what tragedy in  the dim past had caused this hatred of males on the part of her  visitor.
 Miss Trimble had not the appearance of one who would  lightly be deceived by Man; still less the appearance of one whom  Man, unless short-sighted and extraordinarily susceptible, would  go out of his way to deceive.
 She was still turning this mystery  over in her mind, when her visitor spoke.
    "Well, gimme th' rest of th' dope," said Miss Trimble.
    "I beg your pardon?"    "More facts.
 Spill 'm!"    "Oh, I understand," said Mrs. Pett hastily, and embarked on a  brief narrative of the suspicious circumstances which had caused  her to desire skilled assistance.
    "Lor' W'sbeach?" said Miss Trimble, breaking the story.
 "Who's  he?"    "A very great friend of ours.
"    "You vouch f'r him pers'n'lly? He's all right, uh? Not a crook,  huh?"    "Of course he is not!" said Mrs. Pett indignantly.
 "He's a great  friend of mine.
"    "All right.
 Well, I guess thass 'bout all, huh? I'll be going  downstairs 'an starting in.
"    "You can come here immediately?"    "Sure.
 Got parlour-maid rig round at m' boarding-house round  corner.
 Come back with it 'n ten minutes.
 Same dress I used when  I w's working on th' Marling D'vorce case.
 D'jer know th'  Marlings? Idle rich! Bound t' get 'nto trouble.
 I fixed 'm.
 Well,  g'bye.
 Mus' be going.
 No time t' waste.
"    Mrs. Pett leaned back faintly in her chair.
 She felt overcome.
    Downstairs, on her way out, Miss Trimble had paused in the hall  to inspect a fine statue which stood at the foot of the stairs.
  It was a noble work of art, but it seemed to displease her.
 She  snorted.
    "Idle rich!" she muttered scornfully.
 "Brrh!"    The portly form of Mr. Crocker loomed up from the direction of  the back stairs.
 She fixed her left eye on him piercingly.
 Mr.  Crocker met it, and quailed.
 He had that consciousness of guilt  which philosophers tell is the worst drawback to crime.
 Why this  woman's gaze should disturb him so thoroughly, he could not have  said.
 She was a perfect stranger to him.
 She could know nothing  about him.
 Yet he quailed.
    "Say," said Miss Trimble.
 "I'm c'ming here 's parlour-maid.
"    "Oh, ah?" said Mr. Crocker, feebly.
    "Grrrh!" observed Miss Trimble, and departed.
            THE VOICE PROM THE PAST    The library, whither Jimmy had made his way after leaving Mrs.  Pett, was a large room on the ground floor, looking out on the  street which ran parallel to the south side of the house.
 It had  French windows, opening onto a strip of lawn which ended in a  high stone wall with a small gate in it, the general effect of  these things being to create a resemblance to a country house  rather than to one in the centre of the city.
 Mr. Pett's town  residence was full of these surprises.
    In one corner of the room a massive safe had been let into the  wall, striking a note of incongruity, for the remainder of the  wall-space was completely covered with volumes of all sorts and  sizes, which filled the shelves and overflowed into a small  gallery, reached by a short flight of stairs and running along  the north side of the room over the door.
    Jimmy cast a glance at the safe, behind the steel doors of which  he presumed the test-tube of Partridgite which Willie had carried  from the luncheon-table lay hid: then transferred his attention  to the shelves.
 A cursory inspection of these revealed nothing  which gave promise of whiling away entertainingly the moments  which must elapse before the return of Ann.
 Jimmy's tastes in  literature lay in the direction of the lighter kind of modern  fiction, and Mr. Pett did not appear to possess a single volume  that had been written later than the eighteenth century--and  mostly poetry at that.
 He turned to the writing-desk near the  window, on which he had caught sight of a standing shelf full of  books of a more modern aspect.
 He picked one up at random and  opened it.
    He threw it down disgustedly.
 It was poetry.
 This man Pett  appeared to have a perfect obsession for poetry.
 One would never  have suspected it, to look at him.
 Jimmy had just resigned  himself, after another glance at the shelf, to a bookless vigil,  when his eye was caught by a name on the cover of the last in the  row so unexpected that he had to look again to verify the  discovery.
    He had been perfectly right.
 There it was, in gold letters.
                    THE LONELY HEART                          BY                      ANN CHESTER    He extracted the volume from the shelf in a sort of stupor.
 Even  now he was inclined to give his goddess of the red hair the  benefit of the doubt, and assume that some one else of the same  name had written it.
 For it was a defect in Jimmy's  character--one of his many defects--that he loathed and scorned  minor poetry and considered minor poets, especially when  feminine, an unnecessary affliction.
 He declined to believe that  Ann, his Ann, a girl full of the finest traits of character, the  girl who had been capable of encouraging a comparative stranger  to break the law by impersonating her cousin Jimmy Crocker, could  also be capable of writing The Lonely Heart and other poems.
 He  skimmed through the first one he came across, and shuddered.
 It  was pure slush.
 It was the sort of stuff they filled up pages  with in the magazines when the detective story did not run long  enough.
 It was the sort of stuff which long-haired blighters read  alone to other long-haired blighters in English suburban  drawing-rooms.
 It was the sort of stuff which--to be brief--gave  him the Willies.
 No, it could not be Ann who had written it.
    The next moment the horrid truth was thrust upon him.
 There was  an inscription on the title page.
    "To my dearest uncle Peter, with love from the author, Ann  Chester.
"    The room seemed to reel before Jimmy's eyes.
 He felt as if a  friend had wounded him in his tenderest feelings.
 He felt as if  some loved one had smitten him over the back of the head with a  sandbag.
 For one moment, in which time stood still, his devotion  to Ann wobbled.
 It was as if he had found her out in some  terrible crime that revealed unsuspected flaws in her hitherto  ideal character.
    Then his eye fell upon the date on the title page, and a strong  spasm of relief shook him.
 The clouds rolled away, and he loved  her still.
 This frightful volume had been published five years  ago.
    A wave of pity swept over Jimmy.
 He did not blame her now.
 She  had been a mere child five years ago, scarcely old enough to  distinguish right from wrong.
 You couldn't blame her for writing  sentimental verse at that age.
 Why, at a similar stage in his own  career he had wanted to be a vaudeville singer.
 Everything must  be excused to Youth.
 It was with a tender glow of affectionate  forgiveness that he turned the pages.
    As he did so a curious thing happened to him.
 He began to have  that feeling, which every one has experienced at some time or  other, that he had done this very thing before.
 He was almost  convinced that this was not the first time he had seen that poem  on page twenty-seven entitled "A Lament.
" Why, some of the lines  seemed extraordinarily familiar.
 The people who understood these  things explained this phenomenon, he believed, by some stuff  about the cells of the brain working simultaneously or something.
  Something about cells, anyway.
 He supposed that that must be it.
    But that was not it.
 The feeling that he had read all this before  grew instead of vanishing, as is generally the way on these  occasions.
 He _had_ read this stuff before.
 He was certain of it.
  But when? And where? And above all why? Surely he had not done it  from choice.
    It was the total impossibility of his having done it from choice  that led his memory in the right direction.
 There had only been a  year or so in his life when he had been obliged to read things  which he would not have read of his own free will, and that had  been when he worked on the _Chronicle_.
 Could it have been that  they had given him this book of poems to review? Or--?    And then memory, in its usual eccentric way, having taken all  this time to make the first part of the journey, finished the  rest of it with one lightning swoop, and he knew.
    And with the illumination came dismay.
 Worse than dismay.
 Horror.
    "Gosh!" said Jimmy.
    He knew now why he had thought on the occasion of their first  meeting in London that he had seen hair like Ann's before.
 The  mists rolled away and he saw everything clear and stark.
 He knew  what had happened at that meeting five years before, to which she  had so mysteriously alluded.
 He knew what she had meant that  evening on the boat, when she had charged one Jimmy Crocker with  having cured her of sentiment.
 A cold sweat sprang into being  about his temples.
 He could remember that interview now, as  clearly as if it had happened five minutes ago instead of five  years.
 He could recall the article for the _Sunday Chronicle_ which  he had written from the interview, and the ghoulish gusto with  which he had written it.
 He had had a boy's undisciplined sense  of humour in those days, the sense of humour which riots like a  young colt, careless of what it bruises and crushes.
 He shuddered  at the recollection of the things he had hammered out so  gleefully on his typewriter down at the _Chronicle_ office.
 He  found himself recoiling in disgust from the man he had been, the  man who could have done a wanton thing like that without  compunction or ruth.
 He had read extracts from the article to an  appreciative colleague.
 .
 .
 .
    A great sympathy for Ann welled up in him.
 No wonder she hated  the memory of Jimmy Crocker.
    It is probable that remorse would have tortured him even further,  had he not chanced to turn absently to page forty-six and read a  poem entitled "Love's Funeral.
" It was not a long poem, and he  had finished it inside of two minutes; but by that time a change  had come upon his mood of self-loathing.
 He no longer felt like a  particularly mean murderer.
 "Love's Funeral" was like a tonic.
  It braced and invigourated him.
 It was so unspeakably absurd, so  poor in every respect.
 All things, he now perceived, had worked  together for good.
 Ann had admitted on the boat that it was his  satire that had crushed out of her the fondness for this sort of  thing.
 If that was so, then the part he had played in her life  had been that of a rescuer.
 He thought of her as she was now and  as she must have been then to have written stuff like this, and  he rejoiced at what he had done.
 In a manner of speaking the Ann  of to-day, the glorious creature who went about the place  kidnapping Ogdens, was his handiwork.
 It was he who had destroyed  the minor poetry virus in her.
    The refrain of an old song came to him.
            "You made me what I am to-day!           I hope you're satisfied!"    He was more than satisfied.
 He was proud of himself.
    He rejoiced, however, after the first flush of enthusiasm,  somewhat moderately.
 There was no disguising the penalty of his  deed of kindness.
 To Ann Jimmy Crocker was no rescuer, but a sort  of blend of ogre and vampire.
 She must never learn his real  identity--or not until he had succeeded by assiduous toil, as he  hoped he would, in neutralising that prejudice of the distant  past.
    A footstep outside broke in on his thoughts.
 He thrust the book  quickly back into its place.
 Ann came in, and shut the door  behind her.
    "Well?" she said eagerly.
    Jimmy did not reply for a moment.
 He was looking at her and  thinking how perfect in every way she was now, as she stood there  purged of sentimentality, all aglow with curiosity to know how  her nefarious plans had succeeded.
 It was his Ann who stood  there, not the author of "The Lonely Heart.
"    "Did you ask her?"    "Yes.
 But--"    Ann's face fell.
    "Oh! She won't let him come back?"    "She absolutely refused.
 I did my best.
"    "I know you did.
"    There was a silence.
    "Well, this settles it," said Jimmy.
 "Now you will have to let me  help you.
"    Ann looked troubled.
    "But it's such a risk.
 Something terrible might happen to you.
  Isn't impersonation a criminal offence?"    "What does it matter? They tell me prisons are excellent places  nowadays.
 Concerts, picnics--all that sort of thing.
 I shan't  mind going there.
 I have a nice singing-voice.
 I think I will try  to make the glee-club.
"    "I suppose we are breaking the law," said Ann seriously.
 "I told  Jerry that nothing could happen to us except the loss of his  place to him and being sent to my grandmother to me, but I'm  bound to say I said that just to encourage him.
 Don't you think  we ought to know what the penalty is, in case we are caught?"    "It would enable us to make our plans.
 If it's a life sentence, I  shouldn't worry about selecting my future career.
"    "You see," explained Ann, "I suppose they would hardly send me to  prison, as I'm a relation--though I would far rather go there  than to grandmother's.
 She lives all alone miles away in the  country, and is strong on discipline--but they might do all sorts  of things to you, in spite of my pleadings.
 I really think you  had better give up the idea, I'm afraid my enthusiasm carried me  away.
 I didn't think of all this before.
"    "Never.
 This thing goes through, or fails over my dead body.
 What  are you looking for?"    Ann was deep in a bulky volume which stood on a lectern by the  window.
    "Catalogue," she said briefly, turning the pages.
 "Uncle Peter  has heaps of law books.
 I'll look up kidnapping.
 Here we are.
 Law  Encyclopedia.
 Shelf X.
 Oh, that's upstairs.
 I shan't be a  minute.
"    She ran to the little staircase, and disappeared.
 Her voice came  from the gallery.
    "Here we are.
 I've got it.
"    "Shoot," said Jimmy.
    "There's such a lot of it," called the voice from above.
 "Pages  and pages.
 I'm just skimming.
 Wait a moment.
"    A rustling followed from the gallery, then a sneeze.
    "This is the dustiest place I was ever in," said the voice.
 "It's  inches deep everywhere.
 It's full of cigarette ends, too.
 I must  tell uncle.
 Oh, here it is.
 Kidnapping--penalties--"    "Hush" called Jimmy.
 "There's some one coming.
"    The door opened.
    "Hello," said Ogden, strolling in.
 "I was looking for you.
 Didn't  think you would be here.
"    "Come right in, my little man, and make yourself at home," said  Jimmy.
    Ogden eyed him with disfavour.
    "You're pretty fresh, aren't you?"    "This is praise from Sir Hubert Stanley.
"    "Eh? Who's he?"    "Oh, a gentleman who knew what was what.
"    Ogden closed the door.
    "Well, I know what's what, too.
 I know what you are for one  thing.
" He chuckled.
 "I've got your number all right.
"    "In what respect?"    Another chuckle proceeded from the bulbous boy.
    "You think you're smooth, don't you? But I'm onto you, Jimmy  Crocker.
 A lot of Jimmy Crocker you are.
 You're a crook.
 Get me?  And I know what you're after, at that.
 You're going to try to  kidnap me.
"    From the corner of his eye Jimmy was aware of Ann's startled  face, looking over the gallery rail and withdrawn hastily.
 No  sound came from the heights, but he knew that she was listening  intently.
    "What makes you think that?"    Ogden lowered himself into the depths of his favourite easy  chair, and, putting his feet restfully on the writing-desk, met  Jimmy's gaze with a glassy but knowing eye.
    "Got a cigarette?" he said.
    "I have not," said Jimmy.
 "I'm sorry.
"    "So am I.
"    "Returning, with your permission, to our original subject," said  Jimmy, "what makes you think that I have come here to kidnap  you?"    Ogden yawned.
    "I was in the drawing-room after lunch, and that guy Lord  Wisbeach came in and said he wanted to talk to mother privately.
  Mother sent me out of the room, so of course I listened at the  door.
"    "Do you know where little boys go who listen to private  conversations?" said Jimmy severely.
    "To the witness-stand generally, I guess.
 Well, I listened, and I  heard this Lord Wisbeach tell mother that he had only pretended  to recognise you as Jimmy Crocker and that really he had never  seen you before in his life.
 He said you were a crook and that  they had got to watch you.
 Well, I knew then why you had come  here.
 It was pretty smooth, getting in the way you did.
 I've got  to hand it to you.
"    Jimmy did not reply.
 His mind was occupied with the contemplation  of this dashing counter-stroke on the part of Gentleman Jack.
 He  could hardly refrain from admiring the simple strategy with which  the latter had circumvented him.
 There was an artistry about the  move which compelled respect.
    "Well, now, see here," said Ogden, "you and I have got to get  together on this proposition.
 I've been kidnapped twice before,  and the only guys that made anything out of it were the  kidnappers.
 It's pretty soft for them.
 They couldn't have got a  cent without me, and they never dreamed of giving me a rake-off.
  I'm getting good and tired of being kidnapped for other people's  benefit, and I've made up my mind that the next guy that wants me  has got to come across.
 See? My proposition is fifty-fifty.
 If  you like it, I'm game to let you go ahead.
 If you don't like it,  then the deal's off, and you'll find that you've a darned poor  chance of getting me.
 When I was kidnapped before, I was just a  kid, but I can look after myself now.
 Well, what do you say?"    Jimmy found it hard at first to say anything.
 He had never  properly understood the possibilities of Ogden's character  before.
 The longer he contemplated him, the more admirable Ann's  scheme appeared.
 It seemed to him that only a resolute keeper of  a home for dogs would be adequately equipped for dealing with  this remarkable youth.
    "This is a commercial age," he said.
    "You bet it is," said Ogden.
 "My middle name is business.
 Say,  are you working this on your own, or are you in with Buck  Maginnis and his crowd?"    "I don't think I know Mr. Maginnis.
"    "He's the guy who kidnapped me the first time.
 He's a rough-neck.
  Smooth Sam Fisher got away with me the second time.
 Maybe you're  in with Sam?"    "No.
"    "No, I guess not.
 I heard that he had married and retired from  business.
 I rather wish you were one of Buck's lot.
 I like Buck.
  When he kidnapped me, I lived with him and he gave me a swell  time.
 When I left him, a woman came and interviewed me about it  for one of the Sunday papers.
 Sob stuff.
 Called the piece 'Even  Kidnappers Have Tender Hearts Beneath A Rough Exterior.
' I've got  it upstairs in my press-clipping album.
 It was pretty bad slush.
  Buck Maginnis hasn't got any tender heart beneath his rough  exterior, but he's a good sort and I liked him.
 We used to shoot  craps.
 And he taught me to chew.
 I'd be tickled to death to have  Buck get me again.
 But, if you're working on your own, all right.
  It's all the same to me, provided you meet me on the terms.
"    "You certainly are a fascinating child.
"    "Less of it, less of it.
 I've troubles enough to bear without  having you getting fresh.
 Well, what about it? Talk figures.
 If I  let you take me away, do we divvy up or don't we? That's all  you've got to say.
"    "That's easily settled.
 I'll certainly give you half of whatever  I get.
"    Ogden looked wistfully at the writing-desk.
    "I wish I could have that in writing.
 But I guess it wouldn't  stand in law.
 I suppose I shall have to trust you.
"    "Honour among thieves.
"    "Less of the thieves.
 This is just a straight business  proposition.
 I've got something valuable to sell, and I'm darned  if I'm going to keep giving it away.
 I've been too easy.
 I ought  to have thought of this before.
 All right, then, that's settled.
  Now it's up to you.
 You can think out the rest of it yourself.
"    He heaved himself out of the chair, and left the room.
 Ann,  coming down from the gallery, found Jimmy meditating.
 He looked  up at the sound of her step.
    "Well, that seems to make it pretty easy for us, doesn't it?" he  said.
 "It solves the problem of ways and means.
"    "But this is awful.
 This alters everything.
 It isn't safe for you  to stay here.
 You must go away at once.
 They've found you out.
  You may be arrested at any moment.
"    "That's a side-issue.
 The main point is to put this thing  through.
 Then we can think about what is going to happen to me.
"    "But can't you see the risk you're running?"    "I don't mind.
 I want to help you.
"    "I won't let you.
"    "You must.
"    "But do be sensible.
 What would you think of me if I allowed you  to face this danger--?"    "I wouldn't think any differently of you.
 My opinion of you is a  fixed thing.
 Nothing can alter it.
 I tried to tell you on the  boat, but you wouldn't let me.
 I think you're the most perfect,  wonderful girl in all the world.
 I've loved you since the first  moment I saw you.
 I knew who you were when we met for half a  minute that day in London.
 We were utter strangers, but I knew  you.
 You were the girl I had been looking for all my life.
 Good  Heavens, you talk of risks.
 Can't you understand that just being  with you and speaking to you and knowing that we share this thing  together is enough to wipe out any thought of risk? I'd do  anything for you.
 And you expect me to back out of this thing  because there is a certain amount of danger!"    Ann had retreated to the door, and was looking at him with wide  eyes.
 With other young men and there had been many--who had said  much the same sort of thing to her since her _debutante_ days she  had been cool and composed--a little sorry, perhaps, but in no  doubt as to her own feelings and her ability to resist their  pleadings.
 But now her heart was racing, and the conviction had  begun to steal over her that the cool and composed Ann Chester  was in imminent danger of making a fool of herself.
 Quite  suddenly, without any sort of warning, she realised that there  was some quality in Jimmy which called aloud to some  corresponding quality in herself--a nebulous something that made  her know that he and she were mates.
 She knew herself hard to  please where men were concerned.
 She could not have described  what it was in her that all the men she had met, the men with  whom she had golfed and ridden and yachted, had failed to  satisfy: but, ever since she had acquired the power of  self-analysis, she had known that it was something which was a  solid and indestructible part of her composition.
 She could not  have put into words what quality she demanded in man, but she had  always known that she would recognise it when she found it: and  she recognised it now in Jimmy.
 It was a recklessness, an  irresponsibility, a cheerful dare-devilry, the complement to her  own gay lawlessness.
    "Ann!" said Jimmy.
    "It's too late!"    She had not meant to say that.
 She had meant to say that it was  impossible, out of the question.
 But her heart was running away  with her, goaded on by the irony of it all.
 A veil seemed to have  fallen from before her eyes, and she knew now why she had been  drawn to Jimmy from the very first.
 They were mates, and she had  thrown away her happiness.
    "I've promised to marry Lord Wisbeach!"    Jimmy stopped dead, as if the blow had been a physical one.
    "You've promised to marry Lord Wisbeach!"    "Yes.
"    "But--but when?"    "Just now.
 Only a few minutes ago.
 When I was driving him to his  hotel.
 He had asked me to marry him before I left for England,  and I had promised to give him his answer when I got back.
 But  when I got back, somehow I couldn't make up my mind.
 The days  slipped by.
 Something seemed to be holding me back.
 He pressed me  to say that I would marry him, and it seemed absurd to go on  refusing to be definite, so I said I would.
"    "You can't love him? Surely you don't--?"    Ann met his gaze frankly.
    "Something seems to have happened to me in the last few minutes,"  she said, "and I can't think clearly.
 A little while ago it  didn't seem to matter much.
 I liked him.
 He was good-looking and  good-tempered.
 I felt that we should get along quite well and be  as happy as most people are.
 That seemed as near perfection as  one could expect to get nowadays, so--well, that's how it was.
"    "But you can't marry him! It's out of the question!"    "I've promised.
"    "You must break your promise.
"    "I can't do that.
"    "You must!"    "I can't.
 One must play the game.
"    Jimmy groped for words.
 "But in this case you mustn't--it's  awful--in this special case--" He broke off.
 He saw the trap he  was in.
 He could not denounce that crook without exposing  himself.
 And from that he still shrank.
 Ann's prejudice against  Jimmy Crocker might have its root in a trivial and absurd  grievance, but it had been growing through the years, and who  could say how strong it was now?    Ann came a step towards him, then paused doubtfully.
 Then, as if  making up her mind, she drew near and touched his sleeve.
    "I'm sorry," she said.
    There was a silence.
    "I'm sorry!"    She moved away.
 The door closed softly behind her.
 Jimmy scarcely  knew that she had gone.
 He sat down in that deep chair which was  Mr. Pett's favourite, and stared sightlessly at the ceiling.
 And  then, how many minutes or hours later he did not know, the sharp  click of the door-handle roused him.
 He sprang from the chair.
  Was it Ann, come back?    It was not Ann.
 Round the edge of the door came inquiringly the  fair head of Lord Wisbeach.
    "Oh!" said his lordship, sighting Jimmy.
    The head withdrew itself.
    "Come here!" shouted Jimmy.
    The head appeared again.
    "Talking to me?"    "Yes, I was talking to you.
"    Lord Wisbeach followed his superstructure into the room.
 He was  outwardly all that was bland and unperturbed, but there was a  wary look in the eye that cocked itself at Jimmy, and he did not  move far from the door.
 His fingers rested easily on the handle  behind him.
 He did not think it probable that Jimmy could have  heard of his visit to Mrs. Pett, but there had been something  menacing in the latter's voice, and he believed in safety first.
    "They told me Miss Chester was here," he said by way of relaxing  any possible strain there might be in the situation.
    "And what the devil do you want with Miss Chester, you slimy,  crawling second-story-worker, you damned, oily yegg?" enquired  Jimmy.
    The sunniest optimist could not have deluded himself into the  belief that the words were spoken in a friendly and genial  spirit.
 Lord Wisbeach's fingers tightened on the door-handle, and  he grew a little flushed about the cheek-bones.
    "What's all this about?" he said.
    "You infernal crook!"    Lord Wisbeach looked anxious.
    "Don't shout like that! Are you crazy? Do you want people to  hear?"    Jimmy drew a deep breath.
    "I shall have to get further away from you," he said more  quietly.
 "There's no knowing what may happen if I don't.
 I don't  want to kill you.
 At least, I do, but I had better not.
"    He retired slowly until brought to a halt by the writing-desk.
 To  this he anchored himself with a firm grip.
 He was extremely  anxious to do nothing rash, and the spectacle of Gentleman Jack  invited rashness.
 He leaned against the desk, clutching its  solidity with both hands.
 Lord Wisbeach held steadfastly to the  door-handle.
 And in this tense fashion the interview proceeded.
    "Miss Chester," said Jimmy, forcing himself to speak calmly, "has  just been telling me that she has promised to marry you.
"    "Quite true," said Lord Wisbeach.
 "It will be announced  to-morrow.
" A remark trembled on his lips, to the effect that he  relied on Jimmy for a fish-slice, but prudence kept it unspoken.
  He was unable at present to understand Jimmy's emotion.
 Why Jimmy  should object to his being engaged to Ann, he could not imagine.
  But it was plain that for some reason he had taken the thing to  heart, and, dearly as he loved a bit of quiet fun, Lord Wisbeach  decided that the other was at least six inches too tall and fifty  pounds too heavy to be bantered in his present mood by one of his  own physique.
 "Why not?"    "It won't be announced to-morrow," said Jimmy.
 "Because by  to-morrow you will be as far away from here as you can get, if  you have any sense.
"    "What do you mean?"    "Just this.
 If you haven't left this house by breakfast time  to-morrow, I shall expose you.
"    Lord Wisbeach was not feeling particularly happy, but he laughed  at this.
    "You!"    "That's what I said.
"    "Who do you think you are, to go about exposing people?"    "I happen to be Mrs. Pett's nephew, Jimmy Crocker.
"    Lord Wisbeach laughed again.
    "Is that the line you are going to take?"    "It is.
"    "You are going to Mrs. Pett to tell her that you are Jimmy  Crocker and that I am a crook and that you only pretended to  recognise me for reasons of your own?"    "Just that.
"    "Forget it!" Lord Wisbeach had forgotten to be alarmed in his  amusement.
 He smiled broadly.
 "I'm not saying it's not good stuff  to pull, but it's old stuff now.
 I'm sorry for you, but I thought  of it before you did.
 I went to Mrs. Pett directly after lunch  and sprang that line of talk myself.
 Do you think she'll believe  you after that? I tell you I'm ace-high with that dame.
 You  can't queer me with her.
"    "I think I can.
 For the simple reason that I really am Jimmy  Crocker.
"    "Yes, you are.
"    "Exactly.
 Yes, I am.
"    Lord Wisbeach smiled tolerantly.
    "It was worth trying the bluff, I guess, but it won't work.
 I  know you'd be glad to get me out of this house, but you've got to  make a better play than that to do it.
"    "Don't deceive yourself with the idea that I'm bluffing.
 Look  here.
" He suddenly removed his coat and threw it to Lord  Wisbeach.
 "Read the tailor's label inside the pocket.
 See the  name.
 Also the address.
 'J.
 Crocker.
 Drexdale House.
 Grosvenor  Square.
 London.
'"    Lord Wisbeach picked up the garment and looked as directed.
 His  face turned a little sallower, but he still fought against his  growing conviction.
    "That's no proof.
"    "Perhaps not.
 But, when you consider the reputation of the tailor  whose name is on the label, it's hardly likely that he would be  standing in with an impostor, is it? If you want real proof, I  have no doubt that there are half a dozen men working on the  _Chronicle_ who can identify me.
 Or are you convinced already?"    Lord Wisbeach capitulated.
    "I don't know what fool game you think you're playing, but I  can't see why you couldn't have told me this when we were talking  after lunch.
"    "Never mind.
 I had my reasons.
 They don't matter.
 What matters is  that you are going to get out of here to-morrow.
 Do you  understand that?"    "I get you.
"    "Then that's about all, I think.
 Don't let me keep you.
"    "Say, listen.
" Gentleman Jack's voice was plaintive.
 "I think you  might give a fellow a chance to get out good.
 Give me time to  have a guy in Montreal send me a telegram telling me to go up  there right away.
 Otherwise you might just as well put the cops  on me at once.
 The old lady knows I've got business in Canada.
  You don't need to be rough on a fellow.
"    Jimmy pondered this point.
    "All right.
 I don't object to that.
"    "Thanks.
"    "Don't start anything, though.
"    "I don't know what you mean.
"    Jimmy pointed to the safe.
    "Come, come, friend of my youth.
 We have no secrets from each  other.
 I know you're after what's in there, and you know that I  know.
 I don't want to harp on it, but you'll be spending to-night  in the house, and I think you had better make up your mind to  spend it in your room, getting a nice sleep to prepare you for  your journey.
 Do you follow me, old friend?"    "I get you.
"    "That will be all then, I think.
 Wind a smile around your neck  and recede.
"    The door slammed.
 Lord Wisbeach had restrained his feelings  successfully during the interview, but he could not deny himself  that slight expression of them.
 Jimmy crossed the room and took  his coat from the chair where the other had dropped it.
 As he did  so a voice spoke.
    "Say!"    Jimmy spun round.
 The room was apparently empty.
 The thing was  beginning to assume an uncanny aspect, when the voice spoke  again.
    "You think you're darned funny, don't you?"    It came from above.
 Jimmy had forgotten the gallery.
 He directed  his gaze thither, and perceived the heavy face of Ogden hanging  over the rail like a gargoyle.
    "What are you doing there?" he demanded.
    "Listening.
"    "How did you get there?"    "There's a door back here that you get to from the stairs.
 I  often come here for a quiet cigarette.
 Say, you think yourself  some josher, don't you, telling me you were a kidnapper! You  strung me like an onion.
 So you're really Jimmy Crocker after  all? Where was the sense in pulling all that stuff about taking  me away and divvying up the ransom? Aw, you make me tired!"    The head was withdrawn, and Jimmy heard heavy steps followed by  the banging of a door.
 Peace reigned in the library.
    Jimmy sat down in the chair which was Mr. Pett's favourite and  which Ogden was accustomed to occupy to that gentleman's  displeasure.
 The swiftness of recent events had left him a little  dizzy, and he desired to think matters over and find out exactly  what had happened.
    The only point which appeared absolutely clear to him in a welter  of confusing occurrences was the fact that he had lost the chance  of kidnapping Ogden.
 Everything had arranged itself so  beautifully simply and conveniently as regarded that venture  until a moment ago; but now that the boy had discovered his  identity it was impossible for him to attempt it.
 He was loth to  accept this fact.
 Surely, even now, there was a way .
 .
 .
    Quite suddenly an admirable plan occurred to him.
 It involved the  co-operation of his father.
 And at that thought he realised with  a start that life had been moving so rapidly for him since his  return to the house that he had not paid any attention at all to  what was really as amazing a mystery as any.
 He had been too busy  to wonder why his father was there.
    He debated the best method of getting in touch with him.
 It was  out of the question to descend to the pantry or wherever it was  that his father lived in this new incarnation of his.
 Then the  happy thought struck him that results might be obtained by the  simple process of ringing the bell.
 It might produce some other  unit of the domestic staff.
 However, it was worth trying.
 He rang  the bell.
    A few moments later the door opened.
 Jimmy looked up.
 It was not  his father.
 It was a dangerous-looking female of uncertain age,  dressed as a parlour-maid, who eyed him with what seemed to his  conscience-stricken soul dislike and suspicion.
 She had a  tight-lipped mouth and beady eyes beneath heavy brows.
 Jimmy had  seldom seen a woman who attracted him less at first sight.
    "Jer ring, S'?"    Jimmy blinked and almost ducked.
 The words had come at him like a  projectile.
    "Oh, ah, yes.
"    "J' want anything, s'?"    With an effort Jimmy induced his mind to resume its interrupted  equilibrium.
    "Oh, ah, yes.
 Would you mind sending Skinner the butler to me.
"    "Y's'r.
"    The apparition vanished.
 Jimmy drew out his handkerchief and  dabbed at his forehead.
 He felt weak and guilty.
 He felt as if he  had just been accused of nameless crimes and had been unable to  deny the charge.
 Such was the magic of Miss Trimble's eye--the  left one, which looked directly at its object.
 Conjecture pauses  baffled at the thought of the effect which her gaze might have  created in the breasts of the sex she despised, had it been  double instead of single-barrelled.
 But half of it had wasted  itself on a spot some few feet to his right.
    Presently the door opened again, and Mr. Crocker appeared,  looking like a benevolent priest.
            BETWEEN FATHER AND SON    "Well, Skinner, my man," said Jimmy, "how goes it?"    Mr. Crocker looked about him cautiously.
 Then his priestly manner  fell from him like a robe, and he bounded forward.
    "Jimmy!" he exclaimed, seizing his son's hand and shaking it  violently.
 "Say, it's great seeing you again, Jim!"    Jimmy drew himself up haughtily.
    "Skinner, my good menial, you forget yourself strangely! You will  be getting fired if you mitt the handsome guest in this chummy  fashion!" He slapped his father on the back.
 "Dad, this is great!  How on earth do you come to be here? What's the idea? Why the  buttling? When did you come over? Tell me all!"    Mr. Crocker hoisted himself nimbly onto the writing-desk, and sat  there, beaming, with dangling legs.
    "It was your letter that did it, Jimmy.
 Say, Jim, there wasn't  any need for you to do a thing like that just for me.
"    "Well, I thought you would have a better chance of being a peer  without me around.
 By the way, dad, how did my step-mother take  the Lord Percy episode?"    A shadow fell upon Mr. Crocker's happy face.
    "I don't like to do much thinking about your step-mother," he  said.
 "She was pretty sore about Percy.
 And she was pretty sore  about your lighting out for America.
 But, gee! what she must be  feeling like now that I've come over, I daren't let myself  think.
"    "You haven't explained that yet.
 Why did you come over?"    "Well, I'd been feeling homesick--I always do over there in the  baseball season--and then talking with Pett made it worse--"    "Talking with Pett? Did you see him, then, when he was in  London?"    "See him? I let him in!"    "How?"    "Into the house, I mean.
 I had just gone to the front door to see  what sort of a day it was--I wanted to know if there had been  enough rain in the night to stop my having to watch that cricket  game--and just as I got there the bell rang.
 I opened the door.
"    "A revoltingly plebeian thing to do! I'm ashamed of you, dad!  They won't stand for that sort of thing in the House of Lords!"    "Well, before I knew what was happening they had taken me for the  butler.
 I didn't want your step-mother to know I'd been opening  doors--you remember how touchy she was always about it so I just  let it go at that and jollied them along.
 But I just couldn't  help asking the old man how the pennant race was making out, and  that tickled him so much that he offered me a job here as butler  if I ever wanted to make a change.
 And then your note came saying  that you were going to New York, and--well, I couldn't help  myself.
 You couldn't have kept me in London with ropes.
 I sneaked  out next day and bought a passage on the _Carmantic_--she sailed  the Wednesday after you left--and came straight here.
 They gave  me this job right away.
" Mr. Crocker paused, and a holy light of  enthusiasm made his homely features almost beautiful.
 "Say, Jim,  I've seen a ball-game every darned day since I landed! Say, two  days running Larry Doyle made home-runs! But, gosh! that guy Klem  is one swell robber! See here!" Mr. Crocker sprang down from the  desk, and snatched up a handful of books, which he proceeded to  distribute about the floor.
 "There were two men on bases in the  sixth and What's-his-name came to bat.
 He lined one out to  centre-field--where this book is--and--"    "Pull yourself together, Skinner! You can't monkey about with the  employer's library like that.
" Jimmy restored the books to their  places.
 "Simmer down and tell me more.
 Postpone the gossip from  the diamond.
 What plans have you made? Have you considered the  future at all? You aren't going to hold down this buttling job  forever, are you? When do you go back to London?"    The light died out of Mr. Crocker's face.
    "I guess I shall have to go back some time.
 But how can I yet,  with the Giants leading the league like this?"    "But did you just light out without saying anything?"    "I left a note for your step-mother telling her I had gone to  America for a vacation.
 Jimmy, I hate to think what she's going  to do to me when she gets me back!"    "Assert yourself, dad! Tell her that woman's place is the home  and man's the ball-park! Be firm!"    Mr. Crocker shook his head dubiously.
    "It's all very well to talk that way when you're three thousand  miles from home, but you know as well as I do, Jim, that your  step-mother, though she's a delightful woman, isn't the sort you  can assert yourself with.
 Look at this sister of hers here.
 I  guess you haven't been in the house long enough to have noticed,  but she's very like Eugenia in some ways.
 She's the boss all  right, and old Pett does just what he's told to.
 I guess it's the  same with me, Jim.
 There's a certain type of man that's just born  to have it put over on him by a certain type of woman.
 I'm that  sort of man and your stepmother's that sort of woman.
 No, I guess  I'm going to get mine all right, and the only thing to do is to  keep it from stopping me having a good time now.
"    There was truth in what he said, and Jimmy recognised it.
 He  changed the subject.
    "Well, never mind that.
 There's no sense in worrying oneself  about the future.
 Tell me, dad, where did you get all the  'dinner-is-served, madam' stuff? How did you ever learn to be a  butler?"    "Bayliss taught me back in London.
 And, of course, I've played  butlers when I was on the stage.
"    Jimmy did not speak for a moment.
    "Did you ever play a kidnapper, dad?" he asked at length.
    "Sure.
 I was Chicago Ed.
 in a crook play called 'This Way Out.
'  Why, surely you saw me in that? I got some good notices.
"    Jimmy nodded.
    "Of course.
 I knew I'd seen you play that sort of part some time.
  You came on during the dark scene and--"    "--switched on the lights and--"    "--covered the bunch with your gun while they were still  blinking! You were great in that part, dad.
"    "It was a good part," said Mr. Crocker modestly.
 "It had fat.
 I'd  like to have a chance to play a kidnapper again.
 There's a lot of  pep to kidnappers.
"    "You _shall_ play one again," said Jimmy.
 "I am putting on a little  sketch with a kidnapper as the star part.
"    "Eh? A sketch? You, Jim? Where?"    "Here.
 In this house.
 It is entitled 'Kidnapping Ogden' and opens  to-night.
"    Mr. Crocker looked at his only son in concern.
 Jimmy appeared to  him to be rambling.
    "Amateur theatricals?" he hazarded.
    "In the sense that there is no pay for performing, yes.
 Dad, you  know that kid Ogden upstairs? Well, it's quite simple.
 I want you  to kidnap him for me.
"    Mr. Crocker sat down heavily.
 He shook his head.
    "I don't follow all this.
"    "Of course not.
 I haven't begun to explain.
 Dad, in your rambles  through this joint you've noticed a girl with glorious red-gold  hair, I imagine?"    "Ann Chester?"    "Ann Chester.
 I'm going to marry her.
"    "Jimmy!"    "But she doesn't know it yet.
 Now, follow me carefully, dad.
 Five  years ago Ann Chester wrote a book of poems.
 It's on that desk  there.
 You were using it a moment back as second-base or  something.
 Now, I was working at that time on the _Chronicle_.
 I  wrote a skit on those poems for the Sunday paper.
 Do you begin to  follow the plot?"    "She's got it in for you? She's sore?"    "Exactly.
 Get that firmly fixed in your mind, because it's the  source from which all the rest of the story springs.
"    Mr. Crocker interrupted.
    "But I don't understand.
 You say she's sore at you.
 Well, how is  it that you came in together looking as if you were good friends  when I let you in this morning?"    "I was waiting for you to ask that.
 The explanation is that she  doesn't know that I am Jimmy Crocker.
"    "But you came here saying that you were Jimmy Crocker.
"    "Quite right.
 And that is where the plot thickens.
 I made Ann's  acquaintance first in London and then on the boat.
 I had found  out that Jimmy Crocker was the man she hated most in the world,  so I took another name.
 I called myself Bayliss.
"    "Bayliss!"    "I had to think of something quick, because the clerk at the  shipping office was waiting to fill in my ticket.
 I had just been  talking to Bayliss on the phone and his was the only name that  came into my mind.
 You know how it is when you try to think of a  name suddenly.
 Now mark the sequel.
 Old Bayliss came to see me  off at Paddington.
 Ann was there and saw me.
 She said 'Good  evening, Mr. Bayliss' or something, and naturally old Bayliss  replied 'What ho!' or words to that effect.
 The only way to  handle the situation was to introduce him as my father.
 I did so.
  Ann, therefore, thinks that I am a young man named Bayliss who  has come over to America to make his fortune.
 We now come to the  third reel.
 I met Ann by chance at the Knickerbocker and took her  to lunch.
 While we were lunching, that confirmed congenital  idiot, Reggie Bartling, who happened to have come over to America  as well, came up and called me by my name.
 I knew that, if Ann  discovered who I really was, she would have nothing more to do  with me, so I gave Reggie the haughty stare and told him that he  had made a mistake.
 He ambled away--and possibly committed  suicide in his anguish at having made such a bloomer--leaving Ann  discussing with me the extraordinary coincidence of my being  Jimmy Crocker's double.
 Do you follow the story of my life so  far?"    Mr. Crocker, who had been listening with wrinkled brow and other  signs of rapt attention, nodded.
    "I understand all that.
 But how did you come to get into this  house?"    "That is reel four.
 I am getting to that.
 It seems that Ann, who  is the sweetest girl on earth and always on the lookout to do  some one a kindness, had decided, in the interests of the boy's  future, to remove young Ogden Ford from his present sphere, where  he is being spoiled and ruined, and send him down to a man on  Long Island who would keep him for awhile and instil the first  principles of decency into him.
 Her accomplice in this admirable  scheme was Jerry Mitchell.
"    "Jerry Mitchell!"    "Who, as you know, got fired yesterday.
 Jerry was to have done  the rough work of the job.
 But, being fired, he was no longer  available.
 I, therefore, offered to take his place.
 So here I  am.
"    "You're going to kidnap that boy?"    "No.
 You are.
"    "Me!"    "Precisely.
 You are going to play a benefit performance of your  world-famed success, Chicago Ed.
 Let me explain further.
 Owing to  circumstances which I need not go into, Ogden has found out that  I am really Jimmy Crocker, so he refuses to have anything more to  do with me.
 I had deceived him into believing that I was a  professional kidnapper, and he came to me and offered to let me  kidnap him if I would go fifty-fifty with him in the ransom!"    "Gosh!"    "Yes, he's an intelligent child, full of that sort of bright  ideas.
 Well, now he has found that I am not all his fancy painted  me, he wouldn't come away with me; and I want you to understudy  me while the going is good.
 In the fifth reel, which will be  released to-night after the household has retired to rest, you  will be featured.
 It's got to be tonight, because it has just  occurred to me that Ogden, knowing that Lord Wisbeach is a crook,  may go to him with the same proposal that he made to me.
"    "Lord Wisbeach a crook!"    "Of the worst description.
 He is here to steal that explosive  stuff of Willie Partridge's.
 But as I have blocked that play, he  may turn his attention to Ogden.
"    "But, Jimmy, if that fellow is a crook--how do you know he is?"    "He told me so himself.
"    "Well, then, why don't you expose him?"    "Because in order to do so, Skinner my man, I should have to  explain that I was really Jimmy Crocker, and the time is not yet  ripe for that.
 To my thinking, the time will not be ripe till you  have got safely away with Ogden Ford.
 I can then go to Ann and  say 'I may have played you a rotten trick in the past, but I have  done you a good turn now, so let's forget the past!' So you see  that everything now depends on you, dad.
 I'm not asking you to do  anything difficult.
 I'll go round to the boarding-house now and  tell Jerry Mitchell about what we have arranged, and have him  waiting outside here in a car.
 Then all you will have to do is to  go to Ogden, play a short scene as Chicago Ed.
, escort him to the  car, and then go back to bed and have a good sleep.
 Once Ogden  thinks you are a professional kidnapper, you won't have any  difficulty at all.
 Get it into your head that he wants to be  kidnapped.
 Surely you can tackle this light and attractive job?  Why, it will be a treat for you to do a bit of character acting  once more!"    Jimmy had struck the right note.
 His father's eyes began to gleam  with excitement.
 The scent of the footlights seemed to dilate his  nostrils.
    "I was always good at that rough-neck stuff," he murmured  meditatively.
 "I used to eat it!"    "Exactly," said Jimmy.
 "Look at it in the right way, and I am  doing you a kindness in giving you this chance.
"    Mr. Crocker rubbed his cheek with his forefinger.
    "You'd want me to make up for the part?" he asked wistfully.
    "Of course!"    "You want me to do it to-night?"    "At about two in the morning, I thought.
"    "I'll do it, Jim!"    Jimmy grasped his hand.
    "I knew I could rely on you, dad.
"    Mr. Crocker was following a train of thought.
    "Dark wig .

 blue chin .

 heavy eyebrows .

 I guess I  can't do better than my old Chicago Ed.
 make-up.
 Say, Jimmy, how  am I to get to the kid?"    "That'll be all right.
 You can stay in my room till the time  comes to go to him.
 Use it as a dressing-room.
"    "How am I to get him out of the house?"    "Through this room.
 I'll tell Jerry to wait out on the  side-street with the car from two o'clock on.
"    Mr. Crocker considered these arrangements.
    "That seems to be about all," he said.
    "I don't think there's anything else.
"    "I'll slip downtown and buy the props.
"    "I'll go and tell Jerry.
"    A thought struck Mr. Crocker.
    "You'd better tell Jerry to make up, too.
 He doesn't want the kid  recognising him and squealing on him later.
"    Jimmy was lost in admiration of his father's resource.
    "You think of everything, dad! That wouldn't have occurred to me.
  You certainly do take to Crime in the most wonderful way.
 It  seems to come naturally to you!"    Mr. Crocker smirked modestly.
            CELESTINE IMPARTS INFORMATION    Plot is only as strong as its weakest link.
 The best-laid schemes  of mice and men gang agley if one of the mice is a mental  defective or if one of the men is a Jerry Mitchell.
 .
 .
 .
    Celestine, Mrs. Pett's maid--she who was really Maggie O'Toole  and whom Jerry loved with a strength which deprived him of even  that small amount of intelligence which had been bestowed upon  him by Nature--came into the house-keeper's room at about ten  o'clock that night.
 The domestic staff had gone in a body to the  moving-pictures, and the only occupant of the room was the new  parlourmaid, who was sitting in a hard chair, reading  Schopenhauer.
    Celestine's face was flushed, her dark hair was ruffled, and her  eyes were shining.
 She breathed a little quickly, and her left  hand was out of sight behind her back.
 She eyed the new  parlour-maid doubtfully for a moment.
 The latter was a woman of  somewhat unencouraging exterior, not the kind that invites  confidences.
 But Celestine had confidences to bestow, and the  exodus to the movies had left her in a position where she could  not pick and choose.
 She was faced with the alternative of  locking her secret in her palpitating bosom or of revealing it to  this one auditor.
 The choice was one which no impulsive damsel in  like circumstances would have hesitated to make.
    "Say!" said Celestine.
    A face rose reluctantly from behind Schopenhauer.
 A gleaming eye  met Celestine's.
 A second eye no less gleaming glared at the  ceiling.
    "Say, I just been talking to my feller outside," said Celestine  with a coy simper.
 "Say, he's a grand man!"    A snort of uncompromising disapproval proceeded from the  thin-lipped mouth beneath the eyes.
 But Celestine was too full of  her news to be discouraged.
    "I'm strong fer Jer!" she said.
    "Huh?" said the student of Schopenhauer.
    "Jerry Mitchell, you know.
 You ain't never met him, have you?  Say, he's a grand man!"    For the first time she had the other's undivided attention.
 The  new parlour-maid placed her book upon the table.
    "Uh?" she said.
    Celestine could hold back her dramatic surprise no longer.
 Her  concealed left hand flashed into view.
 On the third finger  glittered a ring.
 She gazed at it with awed affection.
    "Ain't it a beaut!"    She contemplated its sparkling perfection for a moment in  rapturous silence.
    "Say, you could have knocked me down with a feather!" she  resumed.
 "He telephones me awhile ago and says to be outside the  back door at ten to-night, because he'd something he wanted to  tell me.
 Of course he couldn't come in and tell it me here,  because he'd been fired and everything.
 So I goes out, and there  he is.
 'Hello, kid!' he says to me.
 'Fresh!' I says to him.
  'Say, I got something to be fresh about!' he says to me.
 And then  he reaches into his jeans and hauls out the sparkler.
 'What's  that?' I says to him.
 'It's an engagement ring,' he says to me.
  'For you, if you'll wear it!' I came over so weak, I could have  fell! And the next thing I know he's got it on my finger and--"  Celestine broke off modestly.
 "Say, ain't it a beaut, honest!"  She gave herself over to contemplation once more.
 "He says to me  how he's on Easy Street now, or will be pretty soon.
 I says to  him 'Have you got a job, then?' He says to me 'Now, I ain't got a  job, but I'm going to pull off a stunt to-night that's going to  mean enough to me to start that health-farm I've told you about.
'  Say, he's always had a line of talk about starting a health-farm  down on Long Island, he knowing all about training and health and  everything through having been one of them fighters.
 I asks him  what the stunt is, but he won't tell me yet.
 He says he'll tell  me after we're married, but he says it's sure-fire and he's going  to buy the license tomorrow.
"    She paused for comment and congratulations, eyeing her companion  expectantly.
    "Huh!" said the new parlour-maid briefly, and resumed her  Schopenhauer.
 Decidedly hers was not a winning personality.
    "Ain't it a beaut?" demanded Celestine, damped.
    The new parlour-maid uttered a curious sound at the back of her  throat.
    "He's a beaut!" she said cryptically.
    She added another remark in a lower tone, too low for Celestine's  ears.
 It could hardly have been that, but it sounded to Celestine  like:    "I'll fix 'm!"            CHICAGO ED.
    Riverside Drive slept.
 The moon shone on darkened windows and  deserted sidewalks.
 It was past one o'clock in the morning.
 The  wicked Forties were still ablaze with light and noisy foxtrots;  but in the virtuous Hundreds, where Mr. Pett's house stood,  respectable slumber reigned.
 Only the occasional drone of a  passing automobile broke the silence, or the love-sick cry of  some feline Romeo patrolling a wall-top.
    Jimmy was awake.
 He was sitting on the edge of his bed watching  his father put the finishing touches to his make-up, which was of  a shaggy and intimidating nature.
 The elder Crocker had conceived  the outward aspect of Chicago Ed.
, King of the Kidnappers, on  broad and impressive lines, and one glance would have been enough  to tell the sagacious observer that here was no white-souled  comrade for a nocturnal saunter down lonely lanes and  out-of-the-way alleys.
    Mr. Crocker seemed to feel this himself.
    "The only trouble is, Jim," he said, peering at himself in the  glass, "shan't I scare the boy to death directly he sees me?  Oughtn't I to give him some sort of warning?"    "How? Do you suggest sending him a formal note?"    Mr. Crocker surveyed his repellent features doubtfully.
    "It's a good deal to spring on a kid at one in the morning," he  said.
 "Suppose he has a fit!"    "He's far more likely to give you one.
 Don't you worry about  Ogden, dad.
 I shouldn't think there was a child alive more equal  to handling such a situation.
"    There was an empty glass standing on a tray on the  dressing-table.
 Mr. Crocker eyed this sadly.
    "I wish you hadn't thrown that stuff away, Jim.
 I could have done  with it.
 I'm feeling nervous.
"    "Nonsense, dad! You're all right! I had to throw it away.
 I'm on  the wagon now, but how long I should have stayed on with that  smiling up at me I don't know.
 I've made up my mind never to  lower myself to the level of the beasts that perish with the  demon Rum again, because my future wife has strong views on the  subject: but there's no sense in taking chances.
 Temptation is  all very well, but you don't need it on your dressing-table.
 It  was a kindly thought of yours to place it there, dad, but--"    "Eh? I didn't put it there.
"    "I thought that sort of thing came in your department.
 Isn't it  the butler's job to supply drinks to the nobility and gentry?  Well, it doesn't matter.
 It is now distributed over the  neighbouring soil, thus removing a powerful temptation from your  path.
 You're better without it.
" He looked at his watch.
 "Well,  it ought to be all right now.
" He went to the window.
 "There's an  automobile down there.
 I suppose it's Jerry.
 I told him to be  outside at one sharp and it's nearly half-past.
 I think you might  be starting, dad.
 Oh, by the way, you had better tell Ogden that  you represent a gentleman of the name of Buck Maginnis.
 It was  Buck who got away with him last time, and a firm friendship seems  to-have sprung up between them.
 There's nothing like coming with  a good introduction.
"    Mr. Crocker took a final survey of himself in the mirror.
    "Gee I I'd hate to meet myself on a lonely road!"    He opened the door, and stood for a moment listening.
    From somewhere down the passage came the murmur of a muffled  snore.
    "Third door on the left," said Jimmy.
 "Three--count 'em!--three.
  Don't go getting mixed.
"    Mr. Crocker slid into the outer darkness like a stout ghost, and  Jimmy closed the door gently behind him.
    Having launched his indulgent parent safely on a career of crime,  Jimmy switched off the light and returned to the window.
 Leaning  out, he gave himself up for a moment to sentimental musings.
 The  night was very still.
 Through the trees which flanked the house  the dimmed headlights of what was presumably Jerry Mitchell's  hired car shone faintly like enlarged fire-flies.
 A boat of some  description was tooting reflectively far down the river.
 Such was  the seductive influence of the time and the scene that Jimmy  might have remained there indefinitely, weaving dreams, had he  not been under the necessity of making his way down to the  library.
 It was his task to close the French windows after his  father and Ogden had passed through, and he proposed to remain  hid in the gallery there until the time came for him to do this.
  It was imperative that he avoid being seen by Ogden.
    Locking his door behind him, he went downstairs.
 There were no  signs of life in the house.
 Everything was still.
 He found the  staircase leading to the gallery without having to switch on the  lights.
    It was dusty in the gallery, and a smell of old leather enveloped  him.
 He hoped his father would not be long.
 He lowered himself  cautiously to the floor, and, resting his head against a  convenient shelf, began to wonder how the interview between  Chicago Ed.
 and his prey was progressing.
                                            Mr. Crocker, meanwhile, masked to the eyes, had crept in fearful  silence to the door which Jimmy had indicated.
 A good deal of the  gay enthusiasm with which he had embarked on this enterprise had  ebbed away from him.
 Now that he had become accustomed to the  novelty of finding himself once more playing a character part,  his intimate respectability began to assert itself.
 It was one  thing to play Chicago Ed.
 at a Broadway theatre, but quite another  to give a benefit performance like this.
 As he tip-toed along the  passage, the one thing that presented itself most clearly to him  was the appalling outcome of this act of his, should anything go  wrong.
 He would have turned back, but for the thought that Jimmy  was depending on him and that success would mean Jimmy's  happiness.
 Stimulated by this reflection, he opened Ogden's door  inch by inch and went in.
 He stole softly across the room.
    He had almost reached the bed, and had just begun to wonder how  on earth, now that he was there, he could open the proceedings  tactfully and without alarming the boy, when he was saved the  trouble of pondering further on this problem.
 A light flashed out  of the darkness with the suddenness of a bursting bomb, and a  voice from the same general direction said "Hands up!"    When Mr. Crocker had finished blinking and had adjusted his eyes  to the glare, he perceived Ogden sitting up in bed with a  revolver in his hand.
 The revolver was resting on his knee, and  its muzzle pointed directly at Mr. Crocker's ample stomach.
    Exhaustive as had been the thought which Jimmy's father had given  to the possible developments of his enterprise, this was a  contingency of which he had not dreamed.
 He was entirely at a  loss.
    "Don't do that!" he said huskily.
 "It might go off!"    "I should worry!" replied Ogden coldly.
 "I'm at the right end of  it.
 What are you doing here?" He looked fondly at the lethal  weapon.
 "I got this with cigarette-coupons, to shoot rabbits when  we went to the country.
 Here's where I get a chance at something  part-human.
"    "Do you want to murder me?"    "Why not?"    Mr. Crocker's make-up was trickling down his face in sticky  streams.
 The mask, however, prevented Ogden from seeing this  peculiar phenomenon.
 He was gazing interestedly at his visitor.
  An idea struck him.
    "Say, did you come to kidnap me?"    Mr. Crocker felt the sense of relief which he had sometimes  experienced on the stage when memory had failed him during a  scene and a fellow-actor had thrown him the line.
 It would be  exaggerating to say that he was himself again.
 He could never be  completely at his ease with that pistol pointing at him; but he  felt considerably better.
 He lowered his voice an octave or so,  and spoke in a husky growl.
    "Aw, cheese it, kid.
 Nix on the rough stuff!"    "Keep those hands up!" advised Ogden.
    "Sure! Sure!" growled Mr. Crocker.
 "Can the gun-play, bo! Say,  you've soitanly grown since de last time we got youse!"    Ogden's manner became magically friendly.
    "Are you one of Buck Maginnis' lot?" he enquired almost politely.
    "Dat's right!" Mr. Crocker blessed the inspiration which had  prompted Jimmy's parting words.
 "I'm wit Buck.
"    "Why didn't Buck come himself?"    "He's woiking on anudder job!"    To Mr. Crocker's profound relief Ogden lowered the pistol.
    "I'm strong for Buck," he said conversationally.
 "We're old pals.
  Did you see the piece in the paper about him kidnapping me last  time? I've got it in my press-clipping album.
"    "Sure," said Mr. Crocker.
    "Say, listen.
 If you take me now, Buck's got to come across.
 I  like Buck, but I'm not going to let myself be kidnapped for his  benefit.
 It's fifty-fifty, or nothing doing.
 See?"    "I get you, kid.
"    "Well, if that's understood, all right.
 Give me a minute to get  some clothes on, and I'll be with you.
"    "Don't make a noise," said Mr. Crocker.
    "Who's making any noise? Say, how did you get in here?"    "T'roo de libery windows.
"    "I always knew some yegg would stroll in that way.
 It beats me  why they didn't have bars fixed on them.
"    "Dere's a buzz-wagon outside, waitin'.
"    "You do it in style, don't you?" observed Ogden, pulling on his  shirt.
 "Who's working this with you? Any one I know?"    "Naw.
 A new guy.
"    "Oh? Say, I don't remember you, if it comes to that.
"    "You don't?" said Mr. Crocker a little discomposed.
    "Well, maybe I wouldn't, with that mask on you.
 Which of them  are you?"    "Chicago Ed.
's my monaker.
"    "I don't remember any Chicago Ed.
"    "Well, you will after dis!" said Mr. Crocker, happily inspired.
    Ogden was eyeing him with sudden suspicion.
    "Take that mask off and let's have a look at you.
"    "Nothing doin'.
"    "How am I to know you're on the level?"    Mr. Crocker played a daring card.
    "All right," he said, making a move towards the door.
 "It's up to  youse.
 If you t'ink I'm not on de level, I'll beat it.
"    "Here, stop a minute," said Ogden hastily, unwilling that a  promising business deal should be abandoned in this summary  manner.
 "I'm not saying anything against you.
 There's no need to  fly off the handle like that.
"    "I'll tell Buck I couldn't get you," said Mr. Crocker, moving  another step.
    "Here, stop! What's the matter with you?"    "Are youse comin' wit me?"    "Sure, if you get the conditions.
 Buck's got to slip me half of  whatever he gets out of this.
"    "Dat's right.
 Buck'll slip youse half of anyt'ing he gets.
"    "All right, then.
 Wait till I've got this shoe on, and let's  start.
 Now I'm ready.
"    "Beat it quietly.
"    "What did you think I was going to do? Sing?"    "Step dis way!" said Mr. Crocker jocosely.
    They left the room cautiously.
 Mr. Crocker for a moment had a  sense of something missing.
 He had reached the stairs before he  realised what it was.
 Then it dawned upon him that what was  lacking was the applause.
 The scene had deserved a round.
    Jimmy, vigilant in the gallery, heard the library door open  softly and, peering over the rail, perceived two dim forms in the  darkness.
 One was large, the other small.
 They crossed the room  together.
    Whispered words reached him.
    "I thought you said you came in this way.
"    "Sure.
"    "Then why's the shutter closed?"    "I fixed it after I was in.
"    There was a faint scraping sound, followed by a click.
 The  darkness of the room was relieved by moonlight.
 The figures  passed through.
 Jimmy ran down from the gallery, and closed the  windows softly.
 He had just fastened the shutters, when from the  passage outside there came the unmistakeable sound of a footstep.
            IN THE LIBRARY    Jimmy's first emotion on hearing the footstep was the crude  instinct of self-preservation.
 All that he was able to think of  at the moment was the fact that he was in a questionable position  and one which would require a good deal of explaining away if he  were found, and his only sensation was a strong desire to avoid  discovery.
 He made a silent, scrambling leap for the gallery  stairs, and reached their shelter just as the door opened.
 He  stood there, rigid, waiting to be challenged, but apparently he  had moved in time, for no voice spoke.
 The door closed so gently  as to be almost inaudible, and then there was silence again.
 The  room remained in darkness, and it was this perhaps that first  suggested to Jimmy the comforting thought that the intruder was  equally desirous of avoiding the scrutiny of his fellows.
 He had  taken it for granted in his first panic that he himself was the  only person in that room whose motive for being there would not  have borne inspection.
 But now, safely hidden in the gallery, out  of sight from the floor below, he had the leisure to consider the  newcomer's movements and to draw conclusions from them.
    An honest man's first act would surely have been to switch on the  lights.
 And an honest man would hardly have crept so stealthily.
  It became apparent to Jimmy, as he leaned over the rail and tried  to pierce the darkness, that there was sinister work afoot; and  he had hardly reached this conclusion when his mind took a  further leap and he guessed the identity of the soft-footed  person below.
 It could be none but his old friend Lord Wisbeach,  known to "the boys" as Gentleman Jack.
 It surprised him that he  had not thought of this before.
 Then it surprised him that, after  the talk they had only a few hours earlier in that very room,  Gentleman Jack should have dared to risk this raid.
    At this moment the blackness was relieved as if by the striking  of a match.
 The man below had brought an electric torch into  play, and now Jimmy could see clearly.
 He had been right in his  surmise.
 It was Lord Wisbeach.
 He was kneeling in front of the  safe.
 What he was doing to the safe, Jimmy could not see, for the  man's body was in the way; but the electric torch shone on his  face, lighting up grim, serious features quite unlike the amiable  and slightly vacant mask which his lordship was wont to present  to the world.
 As Jimmy looked, something happened in the pool of  light beyond his vision.
 Gentleman Jack gave a muttered  exclamation of satisfaction, and then Jimmy saw that the door of  the safe had swung open.
 The air was full of a penetrating smell  of scorched metal.
 Jimmy was not an expert in these matters, but  he had read from time to time of modern burglars and their  methods, and he gathered that an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe, with  its flame that cuts steel as a knife cuts cheese, had been at  work.
    Lord Wisbeach flashed the torch into the open safe, plunged his  hand in, and drew it out again, holding something.
 Handling this  in a cautious and gingerly manner, he placed it carefully in his  breast pocket.
 Then he straightened himself.
 He switched off the  torch, and moved to the window, leaving the rest of his  implements by the open safe.
 He unfastened the shutter, then  raised the catch of the window.
 At this point it seemed to Jimmy  that the time had come to interfere.
    "Tut, tut!" he said in a tone of mild reproof.
    The effect of the rebuke on Lord Wisbeach was remarkable.
 He  jumped convulsively away from the window, then, revolving on his  own axis, flashed the torch into every corner of the room.
    "Who's that?" he gasped.
    "Conscience!" said Jimmy.
    Lord Wisbeach had overlooked the gallery in his researches.
 He  now turned his torch upwards.
 The light flooded the gallery on  the opposite side of the room from where Jimmy stood.
 There was a  pistol in Gentleman Jack's hand now.
 It followed the torch  uncertainly.
    Jimmy, lying flat on the gallery floor, spoke again.
    "Throw that gun away, and the torch, too," he said.
 "I've got you  covered!"    The torch flashed above his head, but the raised edge of the  gallery rail protected him.
    "I'll give you five seconds.
 If you haven't dropped that gun by  then, I shall shoot!"    As he began to count, Jimmy heartily regretted that he had  allowed his appreciation of the dramatic to lead him into this  situation.
 It would have been so simple to have roused the house  in a prosaic way and avoided this delicate position.
 Suppose his  bluff did not succeed.
 Suppose the other still clung to his  pistol at the end of the five seconds.
 He wished that he had made  it ten instead.
 Gentleman Jack was an enterprising person, as his  previous acts had showed.
 He might very well decide to take a  chance.
 He might even refuse to believe that Jimmy was armed.
 He  had only Jimmy's word for it.
 Perhaps he might be as deficient in  simple faith as he had proved to be in Norman blood! Jimmy  lingered lovingly over his count.
    "Four!" he said reluctantly.
    There was a breathless moment.
 Then, to Jimmy's unspeakable  relief, gun and torch dropped simultaneously to the floor.
 In an  instant Jimmy was himself again.
    "Go and stand with your face to that wall," he said crisply.
  "Hold your hands up!"    "Why?"    "I'm going to see how many more guns you've got.
"    "I haven't another.
"    "I'd like to make sure of that for myself.
 Get moving!"    Gentleman Jack reluctantly obeyed.
 When he had reached the wall,  Jimmy came down.
 He switched on the lights.
 He felt in the  other's pockets, and almost at once encountered something hard  and metallic.
    He shook his head reproachfully.
    "You are very loose and inaccurate in your statements," he said.
  "Why all these weapons? I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier!  Now you can turn around and put your hands down.
"    Gentleman Jack's appeared to be a philosophical nature.
 The  chagrin consequent upon his failure seemed to have left him.
 He  sat on the arm of a chair and regarded Jimmy without apparent  hostility.
 He even smiled a faint smile.
    "I thought I had fixed you, he said.
 You must have been smarter  than I took you for.
 I never supposed you would get on to that  drink and pass it up.
"    Understanding of an incident which had perplexed him came to  Jimmy.
    "Was it you who put that high-ball in my room? Was it doped?"    "Didn't you know?"    "Well," said Jimmy, "I never knew before that virtue got its  reward so darned quick in this world.
 I rejected that high-ball  not because I suspected it but out of pure goodness, because I  had made up my mind that I was through with all that sort of  thing.
"    His companion laughed.
 If Jimmy had had a more intimate  acquaintance with the resourceful individual whom the "boys"  called Gentleman Jack, he would have been disquieted by that  laugh.
 It was an axiom among those who knew him well, that when  Gentleman Jack chuckled in the reflective way, he generally had  something unpleasant up his sleeve.
    "It's your lucky night," said Gentleman Jack.
    "It looks like it.
"    "Well, it isn't over yet.
"    "Very nearly.
 You had better go and put that test-tube back in  what is left of the safe now.
 Did you think I had forgotten it?"    "What test-tube?"    "Come, come, old friend! The one filled with Partridge's  explosive, which you have in your breast-pocket.
"    Gentleman Jack laughed again.
 Then he moved towards the safe.
    "Place it gently on the top shelf," said Jimmy.
    The next moment every nerve in his body was leaping and  quivering.
 A great shout split the air.
 Gentleman Jack,  apparently insane, was giving tongue at the top of his voice.
    "Help! Help! Help!"    The conversation having been conducted up to this point in  undertones, the effect of this unexpected uproar was like an  explosion.
 The cries seemed to echo round the room and shake the  very walls.
 For a moment Jimmy stood paralysed, staring feebly;  then there was a sudden deafening increase in the din.
 Something  living seemed to writhe and jump in his hand.
 He dropped it  incontinently, and found himself gazing in a stupefied way at a  round, smoking hole in the carpet.
 Such had been the effect of  Gentleman Jack's unforeseen outburst that he had quite forgotten  that he held the revolver, and he had been unfortunate enough at  this juncture to pull the trigger.
    There was a sudden rush and a swirl of action.
 Something hit  Jimmy under the chin.
 He staggered back, and when he had  recovered himself found himself looking into the muzzle of the  revolver which had nearly blown a hole in his foot a moment back.
  The sardonic face of Gentleman Jack smiled grimly over the  barrel.
    "I told you the night wasn't over yet!" he said.
    The blow under the chin had temporarily dulled Jimmy's mentality.
  He stood, swallowing and endeavouring to pull himself together  and to get rid of a feeling that his head was about to come off.
  He backed to the desk and steadied himself against it.
    As he did so, a voice from behind him spoke.
    "Whassall this?"    He turned his head.
 A curious procession was filing in through  the open French window.
 First came Mr. Crocker, still wearing his  hideous mask; then a heavily bearded individual with round  spectacles, who looked like an automobile coming through a  haystack; then Ogden Ford, and finally a sturdy,  determined-looking woman with glittering but poorly co-ordinated  eyes, who held a large revolver in her unshaking right hand and  looked the very embodiment of the modern female who will stand no  nonsense.
 It was part of the nightmare-like atmosphere which  seemed to brood inexorably over this particular night that this  person looked to Jimmy exactly like the parlour-maid who had come  to him in this room in answer to the bell and who had sent his  father to him.
 Yet how could it be she? Jimmy knew little of the  habits of parlour-maids, but surely they did not wander about  with revolvers in the small hours?    While he endeavoured feverishly to find reason in this chaos, the  door opened and a motley crowd, roused from sleep by the cries,  poured in.
 Jimmy, turning his head back again to attend to this  invasion, perceived Mrs. Pett, Ann, two or three of the geniuses,  and Willie Partridge, in various stages of _negligee_ and babbling  questions.
    The woman with the pistol, assuming instant and unquestioned  domination of the assembly, snapped out an order.
    "Shutatdoor!"    Somebody shut the door.
    "Now, whassall this?" she said, turning to Gentleman Jack.
            STIRRING TIMES FOR THE PETTS    Gentleman Jack had lowered his revolver, and was standing waiting  to explain all, with the insufferable look of the man who is just  going to say that he has only done his duty and requires no  thanks.
    "Who are you?" he said.
    "Nev' min' who I am!" said Miss Trimble curtly.
 "Siz Pett knows  who I am.
"    "I hope you won't be offended, Lord Wisbeach," said Mrs. Pett  from the group by the door.
 "I engaged a detective to help you.
 I  really thought you could not manage everything by yourself.
 I  hope you do not mind.
"    "Not at all, Mrs. Pett.
 Very wise.
"    "I'm so glad to hear you say so.
"    "An excellent move.
"    Miss Trimble broke in on these amiable exchanges.
    "Whassall this? Howjer mean--help me?"    "Lord Wisbeach most kindly offered to do all he could to protect  my nephew's explosive," said Mrs. Pett.
    Gentleman Jack smiled modestly.
    "I hope I have been of some slight assistance! I think I came  down in the nick of time.
 Look!" He pointed to the safe.
 "He had  just got it open! Luckily I had my pistol with me.
 I covered him,  and called for help.
 In another moment he would have got away.
"    Miss Trimble crossed to the safe and inspected it with a frown,  as if she disliked it.
 She gave a grunt and returned to her place  by the window.
    "Made good job 'f it!" was her comment.
    Ann came forward.
 Her face was glowing and her eyes shone.
    "Do you mean to say that you found Jimmy breaking into the safe?  I never heard anything so absurd!"    Mrs. Pett intervened.
    "This is not James Crocker, Ann! This man is an impostor, who  came into the house in order to steal Willie's invention.
" She  looked fondly at Gentleman Jack.
 "Lord Wisbeach told me so.
 He  only pretended to recognise him this afternoon.
"    A low gurgle proceeded from the open mouth of little Ogden.
 The  proceedings bewildered him.
 The scene he had overheard in the  library between the two men had made it clear to him that Jimmy  was genuine and Lord Wisbeach a fraud, and he could not  understand why Jimmy did not produce his proofs as before.
 He was  not aware that Jimmy's head was only just beginning to clear from  the effects of the blow on the chin.
 Ogden braced himself for  resolute lying in the event of Jimmy calling him as a witness.
  But he did not intend to have his little business proposition  dragged into the open.
    Ann was looking at Jimmy with horror-struck eyes.
 For the first  time it came to her how little she knew of him and how very  likely it was--in the face of the evidence it was almost  certain--that he should have come to the house with the intention  of stealing Willie's explosive.
 She fought against it, but a  voice seemed to remind her that it was he who had suggested the  idea of posing as Jimmy Crocker.
 She could not help remembering  how smoothly and willingly he had embarked on the mad scheme.
  But had it been so mad? Had it not been a mere cloak for this  other venture? If Lord Wisbeach had found him in this room, with  the safe blown open, what other explanation could there be?    And then, simultaneously with her conviction that he was a  criminal, came the certainty that he was the man she loved.
 It  had only needed the spectacle of him in trouble to make her sure.
  She came to his side with the vague idea of doing something to  help him, of giving him her support.
 Once there, she found that  there was nothing to do and nothing to say.
 She put her hand on  his, and stood waiting helplessly for she knew not what.
    It was the touch of her fingers which woke Jimmy from his stupor.
  He came to himself almost with a jerk.
 He had been mistily aware  of what had been said, but speech had been beyond him.
 Now, quite  suddenly, he was a whole man once more.
 He threw himself into the  debate with energy.
    "Good Heavens!" he cried.
 "You're all wrong.
 I found _him_ blowing  open the safe!"    Gentleman Jack smiled superciliously.
    "A likely story, what! I mean to say, it's a bit thin!"    "Ridiculous!" said Mrs. Pett.
 She turned to Miss Trimble with a  gesture.
 "Arrest that man!"    "Wait a mom'nt," replied that clear-headed maiden, picking her  teeth thoughtfully with the muzzle of her revolver.
 "Wait mom'nt.
  Gotta look 'nto this.
 Hear both these guys' st'ries.
"    "Really," said Gentleman Jack suavely, "it seems somewhat  absurd--"    "Ney' mind how 'bsurd 't sounds," returned the fair Trimble  rebukingly.
 "You close y'r face 'n lissen t' me.
 Thass all you've  gotta do.
"    "I know you didn't do it!" cried Ann, tightening her hold on  Jimmy's arm.
    "Less 'f it, please.
 Less 'f it!" Miss Trimble removed the pistol  from her mouth and pointed it at Jimmy.
 "What've you to say? Talk  quick!"    "I happened to be down there--"    "Why?" asked Miss Trimble, as if she had touched off a bomb.
    Jimmy stopped short.
 He perceived difficulties in the way of  explanation.
    "I happened to be down there," he resumed stoutly, "and that man  came into the room with an electric torch and a blowpipe and  began working on the safe--"    The polished tones of Gentleman Jack cut in on his story.
    "Really now, is it worth while?" He turned to Miss Trimble.
 "I came  down here, having heard a noise.
 I did not _happen_ to be here for  some unexplained purpose.
 I was lying awake and something attracted  my attention.
 As Mrs. Pett knows, I was suspicious of this worthy  and expected him to make an attempt on the explosive at any moment:  so I took my pistol and crept downstairs.
 When I got here, the safe  was open and this man making for the window.
"    Miss Trimble scratched her chin caressingly with the revolver,  and remained for a moment in thought.
 Then she turned to Jimmy  like a striking rattlesnake.
    "Y' gotta pull someth'g better th'n that," she said.
 "I got y'r  number.
 Y're caught with th' goods.
"    "No!" cried Ann.
    "Yes!" said Mrs. Pett.
 "The thing is obvious.
"    "I think the best thing I can do," said Gentleman Jack smoothly,  "is to go and telephone for the police.
"    "You think of everything, Lord Wisbeach," said Mrs. Pett.
    "Not at all," said his lordship.
    Jimmy watched him moving to the door.
 At the back of his mind  there was a dull feeling that he could solve the whole trouble if  only he could remember one fact which had escaped him.
 The  effects of the blow he had received still handicapped him.
 He  struggled to remember, but without result.
 Gentleman Jack reached  the door and opened it: and as he did so a shrill yapping,  hitherto inaudible because of the intervening oak and the raised  voices within, made itself heard from the passage outside.
  Gentleman Jack closed the door with a hasty bang.
    "I say that dog's out there!" he said plaintively.
    The scratching of Aida's busy feet on the wood bore out his  words.
 He looked about him, baffled.
    "That dog's out there!" he repeated gloomily.
    Something seemed to give way in Jimmy's brain.
 The simple fact  which had eluded him till now sprang into his mind.
    "Don't let that man get out!" he cried.
 "Good Lord! I've only  just remembered.
 You say you found me breaking into the safe!  You say you heard a noise and came down to investigate! Well,  then, what's that test-tube of the explosive doing in your  breast-pocket?" He swung round to Miss Trimble.
 "You needn't take  my word or his word.
 There's a much simpler way of finding out  who's the real crook.
 Search us both.
" He began to turn out his  pockets rapidly.
 "Look here--and here--and here! Now ask him to  do the same!"    He was pleased to observe a spasm pass across Gentleman Jack's  hitherto composed countenance.
 Miss Trimble was eyeing the latter  with sudden suspicion.
    "Thasso!" she said.
 "Say, Bill, I've f'gott'n y'r name--'sup to  you to show us! Less've a look 't what y' got inside there.
"    Gentleman Jack drew himself up haughtily.
    "I really could not agree to--"    Mrs. Pett interrupted indignantly.
    "I never heard of such a thing! Lord Wisbeach is an old friend--"    "Less'f it!" ordered Miss Trimble, whose left eye was now like  the left eye of a basilisk.
 "Y' _gotta_ show us, Bill, so b'  quick 'bout 't!"    A tired smile played over Gentleman Jack's face.
 He was the bored  aristocrat, mutely protesting against something that "wasn't  done.
" He dipped his slender fingers into his pocket.
 Then,  drawing out the test-tube, and holding it up, he spoke with a  drawling calm for which even Jimmy could not help admiring him.
    "All right! If I'm done, I'm done!"    The sensation caused by his action and his words was of the kind  usually described as profound.
 Mrs. Pett uttered a strangled  shriek.
 Willie Partridge yelped like a dog.
 Sharp exclamations  came simultaneously from each of the geniuses.
    Gentleman Jack waited for the clamour to subside.
 Then he resumed  his gentle drawl.
    "But I'm not done," he explained.
 "I'm going out now through that  window.
 And if anybody tries to stop me, it will be his--or  her--" he bowed politely to Miss Trimble--"last act in the world.
  If any one makes a move to stop me, I shall drop this test-tube  and blow the whole damned place to pieces.
"    If his first speech had made a marked impression on his audience,  his second paralysed them.
 A silence followed as of the tomb.
  Only the yapping of the dog Aida refused to be stilled.
    "Y' stay where y' are!" said Miss Trimble, as the speaker moved  towards the window.
 She held the revolver poised, but for the  first time that night--possibly for the first time in her  life--she spoke irresolutely.
 Superbly competent woman though she  was, here was a situation that baffled her.
    Gentleman Jack crossed the room slowly, the test-tube held aloft  between fore-finger and thumb.
 He was level with Miss Trimble,  who had lowered her revolver and had drawn to one side, plainly at  a loss to know how to handle this unprecedented crisis, when the  door flew open.
 For an instant the face of Howard Bemis, the  poet, was visible.
    "Mrs. Pett, I have telephoned--"    Then another voice interrupted him.
    "Yipe! Yipe! Yipe!"    Through the opening the dog Aida, rejoicing in the removal of the  obstacle, raced like a fur muff mysteriously endowed with legs  and a tongue.
 She tore across the room to where Gentleman Jack's  ankles waited invitingly.
 Ever since their first meeting she had  wanted a fair chance at those ankles, but some one had always  prevented her.
    "Damn!" shouted Gentleman Jack.
    The word was drowned in one vast cataclysm of noise.
 From every  throat in the room there proceeded a shout, a shriek, or some  other variety of cry, as the test-tube, slipping from between the  victim's fingers, described a parabola through the air.
    Ann flung herself into Jimmy's arms, and he held her tight.
 He  shut his eyes.
 Even as he waited for the end the thought flashed  through his mind that, if he must die, this was the manner of  death which he would prefer.
    The test-tube crashed on the writing-desk, and burst into a  million pieces.
 .
 .
 .
    Jimmy opened his eyes.
 Things seemed to be much about the same as  before.
 He was still alive.
 The room in which he stood was solid  and intact.
 Nobody was in fragments.
 There was only one respect  in which the scene differed from what it had been a moment  before.
 Then, it had contained Gentleman Jack.
 Now it did not.
    A great sigh seemed to sweep through the room.
 There was a long  silence.
 Then, from the direction of the street, came the roar of  a starting automobile.
 And at that sound the bearded man with the  spectacles who had formed part of Miss Trimble's procession  uttered a wailing cry.
    "Gee! He's beat it in my bubble! And it was a hired one!"    The words seemed to relieve the tension in the air.
 One by one  the company became masters of themselves once more.
 Miss Trimble,  that masterly woman, was the first to recover.
 She raised herself  from the floor--for with a confused idea that she would be safer  there she had flung herself down--and, having dusted her skirt  with a few decisive dabs of her strong left hand, addressed  herself once more to business.
    "I let 'm bluff me with a fake bomb!" she commented bitterly.
 She  brooded on this for a moment.
 "Say, shut th't door 'gain, some  one, and t'run this mutt out.
 I can't think with th't yapping  going on.
"    Mrs. Pett, pale and scared, gathered Aida into her arms.
 At the  same time Ann removed herself from Jimmy's.
 She did not look at  him.
 She was feeling oddly shy.
 Shyness had never been a failing  of hers, but she would have given much now to have been  elsewhere.
    Miss Trimble again took charge of the situation.
 The sound of the  automobile had died away.
 Gentleman Jack had passed out of their  lives.
 This fact embittered Miss Trimble.
 She spoke with  asperity.
    "Well, _he's_ gone!" she said acidly.
 "Now we can get down t' cases  again.
 Say!" She addressed Mrs. Pett, who started nervously.
 The  experience of passing through the shadow of the valley of death and  of finding herself in one piece instead of several thousand had  robbed her of all her wonted masterfulness.
 "Say, list'n t' me.
  There's been a double game on here t'night.
 That guy that's jus'  gone was th' first part of th' entertainment.
 Now we c'n start th'  sec'nd part.
 You see these ducks?" She indicated with a wave of the  revolver Mr. Crocker and his bearded comrade.
 "They've been trying  t' kidnap y'r son!"    Mrs. Pett uttered a piercing cry.
    "Oggie!"    "Oh, can it!" muttered that youth, uncomfortably.
 He foresaw  awkward moments ahead, and he wished to concentrate his faculties  entirely on the part he was to play in them.
 He looked sideways  at Chicago Ed.
 In a few minutes, he supposed, Ed.
 would be  attempting to minimise his own crimes, by pretending that he,  Ogden, had invited him to come and kidnap him.
 Stout denial must  be his weapon.
    "I had m' suspicions," resumed Miss Trimble, "that someth'ng was  goin' t' be pulled off to-night, 'nd I was waiting outside f'r it  to break loose.
 This guy here," she indicated the bearded  plotter, who blinked deprecatingly through his spectacles, "h's  been waiting on the c'rner of th' street for the last hour with  'n automobile.
 I've b'n watching him right along.
 I was onto h's  game! Well, just now out came the kid with this plug-ugly here.
"  She turned to Mr. Crocker.
 "Say you! Take off th't mask.
 Let's  have a l'k at you!"    Mr. Crocker reluctantly drew the cambric from his face.
    "Goosh!" exclaimed Miss Trimble in strong distaste.
 "Say, 've you  got some kind of a plague, or wh't is it? Y'look like a coloured  comic supplement!" She confronted the shrinking Mr. Crocker and  ran a bony finger over his cheek.
 "Make-up!" she said, eyeing the  stains disgustedly.
 "Grease paint! Goosh!"    "Skinner!" cried Mrs. Pett.
    Miss Trimble scanned her victim more closely.
    "So 't is, if y' do a bit 'f excavating.
" She turned on the  bearded one.
 "'nd I guess all this shrubbery is fake, 'f you come  down to it!" She wrenched at the unhappy man's beard.
 It came off  in her hands, leaving a square chin behind it.
 "If this ain't a  wig, y'll have a headache t'morrow," observed Miss Trimble,  weaving her fingers into his luxuriant head-covering and pulling.
  "Wish y' luck! Ah! 'twas a wig.
 Gimme those spect'cles.
" She  surveyed the results of her handiwork grimly.
 "Say, Clarence,"  she remarked, "y're a wise guy.
 Y' look handsomer with 'em on.
  Does any one know _this_ duck?"    "It is Mitchell," said Mrs. Pett.
 "My husband's physical  instructor.
"    Miss Trimble turned, and, walking to Jimmy, tapped him meaningly  on the chest with her revolver.
    "Say, this is gett'n interesting! This is where y' 'xplain, y'ng  man, how 'twas you happened to be down in this room when th't  crook who's just gone was monkeyin' with the safe.
 L'ks t' me as  if you were in with these two.
"    A feeling of being on the verge of one of those crises which dot  the smooth path of our lives came to Jimmy.
 To conceal his  identity from Ann any longer seemed impossible.
 He was about to  speak, when Ann broke in.
    "Aunt Nesta," she said, "I can't let this go on any longer.
 Jerry  Mitchell isn't to blame.
 I told him to kidnap Ogden!"    There was an awkward silence.
 Mrs. Pett laughed nervously.
    "I think you had better go to bed, my dear child.
 You have had a  severe shock.
 You are not yourself.
"    "But it's true! I did tell him, didn't I, Jerry?"    "Say!" Miss Trimble silenced Jerry with a gesture.
 "You beat 't  back t' y'r little bed, honey, like y'r aunt says.
 Y' say y' told  this guy t' steal th' kid.
 Well, what about this here Skinner? Y'  didn't tell _him_, did y'?"    "I--I--" Ann began confusedly.
 She was utterly unable to account  for Skinner, and it made her task of explaining difficult.
    Jimmy came to the rescue.
 He did not like to think how Ann would  receive the news, but for her own sake he must speak now.
 It  would have required a harder-hearted man than himself to resist  the mute pleading of his father's grease-painted face.
 Mr.  Crocker was a game sport: he would not have said a word without  the sign from Jimmy, even to save himself from a night in prison,  but he hoped that Jimmy would speak.
    "It's perfectly simple," said Jimmy, with an attempt at airiness  which broke down miserably under Miss Trimble's eye.
 "Perfectly  simple.
 I really am Jimmy Crocker, you know.
" He avoided Ann's  gaze.
 "I can't think what you are making all this fuss about.
"    "Th'n why did y' sit in at a plot to kidnap this boy?"    "That, of course--ha, ha!--might seem at first sight to require a  little explanation.
"    "Y' admit it, then?"    "Yes.
 As a matter of fact, I did have the idea of kidnapping  Ogden.
 Wanted to send him to a dogs' hospital, if you understand  what I mean.
" He tried to smile a conciliatory smile, but,  encountering Miss Trimble's left eye, abandoned the project.
 He  removed a bead of perspiration from his forehead with his  handkerchief.
 It struck him as a very curious thing that the  simplest explanations were so often quite difficult to make.
  "Before I go any further, I ought to explain one thing.
 Skinner  there is my father.
"    Mrs. Pett gasped.
    "Skinner was my sister's butler in London.
"    "In a way of speaking," said Jimmy, "that is correct.
 It's rather  a long story.
 It was this way, you see.
 .
 .
 .
"    Miss Trimble uttered an ejaculation of supreme contempt.
    "I n'ver saw such a lot of babbl'ng crooks in m' life! 't beats  me what y' hope to get pulling this stuff.
 Say!" She indicated  Mr. Crocker.
 "This guy's wanted f'r something over in England.
  We've got h's photographs 'n th' office.
 If y' ask me, he lit out  with the spoons 'r something.
 Say!" She fixed one of the geniuses  with her compelling eye.
 "'Bout time y' made y'rself useful.
 Go'n  call up th' Astorbilt on th' phone.
 There's a dame there that's  been making the enquiries f'r this duck.
 She told Anderson's--and  Anderson's handed it on to us--to call her up any hour of the day  'r night when they found him.
 You go get her on the wire and t'll  her t' come right up here'n a taxi and identify him.
"    The genius paused at the door.
    "Whom shall I ask for?"    "Mrs. Crocker," snapped Miss Trimble.
 "Siz Bingley Crocker.
 Tell  her we've found th' guy she's been looking for!"    The genius backed out.
 There was a howl of anguish from the  doorway.
    "I _beg_ your pardon!" said the genius.
    "Can't you look where you're going!"    "I am exceedingly sorry--"    "Brrh!"    Mr. Pett entered the room, hopping.
 He was holding one slippered  foot in his hand and appeared to be submitting it to some form of  massage.
 It was plain that the usually mild and gentle little man  was in a bad temper.
 He glowered round him at the company  assembled.
    "What the devil's the matter here?" he demanded.
 "I stood it as  long as I could, but a man can't get a wink of sleep with this  noise going on!"    "Yipe! Yipe! Yipe!" barked Aida from the shelter of Mrs. Pett's  arms.
    Mr. Pett started violently.
    "Kill that dog! Throw her out! Do _something_ to her!"    Mrs. Pett was staring blankly at her husband.
 She had never seen  him like this before.
 It was as if a rabbit had turned and  growled at her.
 Coming on top of the crowded sensations of the  night, it had the effect of making her feel curiously weak.
 In  all her married life she had never known what fear was.
 She had  coped dauntlessly with the late Mr. Ford, a man of a spirited  temperament; and as for the mild Mr. Pett she had trampled on  him.
 But now she felt afraid.
 This new Peter intimidated her.
            SENSATIONAL TURNING OF A WORM    To this remarkable metamorphosis in Mr. Peter Pett several causes  had contributed.
 In the first place, the sudden dismissal of  Jerry Mitchell had obliged him to go two days without the  physical exercises to which his system had become accustomed, and  this had produced a heavy, irritable condition of body and mind.
  He had brooded on the injustice of his lot until he had almost  worked himself up to rebellion.
 And then, as sometimes happened  with him when he was out of sorts, a touch of gout came to add to  his troubles.
 Being a patient man by nature, he might have borne  up against these trials, had he been granted an adequate night's  rest.
 But, just as he had dropped off after tossing restlessly  for two hours, things had begun to happen noisily in the library.
  He awoke to a vague realisation of tumult below.
    Such was the morose condition of his mind as the result of his  misfortune that at first not even the cries for help could  interest him sufficiently to induce him to leave his bed.
 He knew  that walking in his present state would be painful, and he  declined to submit to any more pain just because some party  unknown was apparently being murdered in his library.
 It was not  until the shrill barking of the dog Aida penetrated right in  among his nerve-centres and began to tie them into knots that he  found himself compelled to descend.
 Even when he did so, it was  in no spirit of kindness.
 He did not come to rescue anybody or to  interfere between any murderer and his victim.
 He came in a fever  of militant wrath to suppress Aida.
 On the threshold of the  library, however, the genius, by treading on his gouty foot, had  diverted his anger and caused it to become more general.
 He had  not ceased to concentrate his venom on Aida.
 He wanted to assail  everybody.
    "What's the matter here?" he demanded, red-eyed.
 "Isn't somebody  going to tell me? Have I got to stop here all night? Who on earth  is this?" He glared at Miss Trimble.
 "What's she doing with that  pistol?" He stamped incautiously with his bad foot, and emitted a  dry howl of anguish.
    "She is a detective, Peter," said Mrs. Pett timidly.
    "A detective? Why? Where did she come from?"    Miss Trimble took it upon herself to explain.
    "Mister Pett, siz Pett sent f'r me t' watch out so's nobody  kidnapped her son.
"    "Oggie," explained Mrs. Pett.
 "Miss Trimble was guarding darling  Oggie.
"    "Why?"    "To--to prevent him being kidnapped, Peter.
"    Mr. Pett glowered at the stout boy.
 Then his eye was attracted by  the forlorn figure of Jerry Mitchell.
 He started.
    "Was this fellow kidnapping the boy?" he asked.
    "Sure," said Miss Trimble.
 "Caught h'm with th' goods.
 He w's  waiting outside there with a car.
 I held h'm and this other guy  up w'th a gun and brought 'em back!"    "Jerry," said Mr. Pett, "it wasn't your fault that you didn't  bring it off, and I'm going to treat you right.
 You'd have done  it if nobody had butted in to stop you.
 You'll get the money to  start that health-farm of yours all right.
 I'll see to that.
 Now  you run off to bed.
 There's nothing to keep you here.
"    "Say!" cried Miss Trimble, outraged.
 "D'ya mean t' say y' aren't  going t' pros'cute? Why, aren't I tell'ng y' I caught h'm  kidnapping th' boy?"    "I told him to kidnap the boy!" snarled Mr. Pett.
    "Peter!"    Mr. Pett looked like an under-sized lion as he faced his wife.
 He  bristled.
 The recollection of all that he had suffered from Ogden  came to strengthen his determination.
    "I've tried for two years to get you to send that boy to a good  boarding-school, and you wouldn't do it.
 I couldn't stand having  him loafing around the house any longer, so I told Jerry Mitchell  to take him away to a friend of his who keeps a dogs' hospital on  Long Island and to tell his friend to hold him there till he got  some sense into him.
 Well, you've spoiled that for the moment  with your detectives, but it still looks good to me.
 I'll give  you a choice.
 You can either send that boy to a boarding-school  next week, or he goes to Jerry Mitchell's friend.
 I'm not going  to have him in the house any longer, loafing in my chair and  smoking my cigarettes.
 Which is it to be?"    "But, Peter!"    "Well?"    "If I send him to a school, he may be kidnapped.
"    "Kidnapping can't hurt him.
 It's what he needs.
 And, anyway, if  he is I'll pay the bill and be glad to do it.
 Take him off to bed  now.
 To-morrow you can start looking up schools.
 Great Godfrey!"  He hopped to the writing-desk and glared disgustedly at the  _debris_ on it.
 "Who's been making this mess on my desk? It's hard!  It's darned hard! The only room in the house that I ask to have  for my own, where I can get a little peace, and I find it turned  into a beer-garden, and coffee or some damned thing spilled all  over my writing-desk!"    "That isn't coffee, Peter," said Mrs. Pett mildly.
 This cave-man  whom she had married under the impression that he was a gentle  domestic pet had taken all the spirit out of her.
 "It's Willie's  explosive.
"    "Willie's explosive?"    "Lord Wisbeach--I mean the man who pretended to be Lord  Wisbeach--dropped it there.
"    "Dropped it there? Well, why didn't it explode and blow the place  to Hoboken, then?"    Mrs. Pett looked helplessly at Willie, who thrust his fingers  into his mop of hair and rolled his eyes.
    "There was fortunately some slight miscalculation in my formula,  uncle Peter," he said.
 "I shall have to look into it to-morrow.
  Whether the trinitrotoluol--"    Mr. Pett uttered a sharp howl.
 He beat the air with his clenched  fists.
 He seemed to be having a brain-storm.
    "Has this--this _fish_ been living on me all this time--have I been  supporting this--this _buzzard_ in luxury all these years while he  fooled about with an explosive that won't explode! He pointed an  accusing finger at the inventor.
 Look into it tomorrow, will you?  Yes, you can look into it to-morrow after six o'clock! Until then  you'll be working--for the first time in your life--working in my  office, where you ought to have been all along.
" He surveyed the  crowded room belligerently.
 "Now perhaps you will all go back to  bed and let people get a little sleep.
 Go home!" he said to the  detective.
    Miss Trimble stood her ground.
 She watched Mrs. Pett pass away  with Ogden, and Willie Partridge head a stampede of geniuses, but  she declined to move.
    "Y' gotta cut th' rough stuff, 'ster Pett," she said calmly.
 "I  need my sleep, j'st 's much 's everyb'dy else, but I gotta stay  here.
 There's a lady c'ming right up in a taxi fr'm th' Astorbilt  to identify this gook.
 She's after'm f'r something.
"    "What! Skinner?"    "'s what he calls h'mself.
"    "What's he done?"    "I d'no.
 Th' lady'll tell us that.
"    There was a violent ringing at the front door bell.
    "I guess that's her," said Miss Trimble.
 "Who's going to let 'r  in? I can't go.
"    "I will," said Ann.
    Mr. Pett regarded Mr. Crocker with affectionate encouragement.
    "I don't know what you've done, Skinner," he said, "but I'll  stand by you.
 You're the best fan I ever met, and if I can keep  you out of the penitentiary, I will.
"    "It isn't the penitentiary!" said Mr. Crocker unhappily.
    A tall, handsome, and determined-looking woman came into the  room.
 She stood in the doorway, looking about her.
 Then her eyes  rested on Mr. Crocker.
 For a moment she gazed incredulously at  his discoloured face.
 She drew a little nearer, peering.
    "D'yo 'dentify 'm, ma'am?" said Miss Trimble.
    "Bingley!"    "Is 't th' guy y' wanted?"    "It's my husband!" said Mrs. Crocker.
    "Y' can't arrest 'm f'r _that!_" said Miss Trimble disgustedly.
    She thrust her revolver back into the hinterland of her costume.
    "Guess I'll be beatin' it," she said with a sombre frown.
 She was  plainly in no sunny mood.
 "'f all th' hunk jobs I was ever on,  this is th' hunkest.
 I'm told off 't watch a gang of crooks, and  after I've lost a night's sleep doing it, it turns out 't's a  nice, jolly fam'ly party!" She jerked her thumb towards Jimmy.
  "Say, this guy says he's that guy's son.
 I s'pose it's all  right?"    "That is my step-son, James Crocker.
"    Ann uttered a little cry, but it was lost in Miss Trimble's  stupendous snort.
 The detective turned to the window.
    "I guess I'll beat 't," she observed caustically, "before it  turns out that I'm y'r l'il daughter Genevieve.
"            NEARLY EVERYBODY HAPPY    Mrs. Crocker turned to her husband.
    "Well, Bingley?" she said, a steely tinkle in her voice.
    "Well, Eugenia?" said Mr. Crocker.
    A strange light was shining in Mr. Crocker's mild eyes.
 He had  seen a miracle happen that night.
 He had seen an even more  formidable woman than his wife dominated by an even meeker man  than himself, and he had been amazed and impressed by the  spectacle.
 It had never even started to occur to him before, but  apparently it could be done.
 A little resolution, a little  determination .
 .
 .
 nothing more was needed.
 He looked at Mr.  Pett.
 And yet Mr. Pett had crumpled up Eugenia's sister with  about three firm speeches.
 It could be done.
 .
 .
 .
    "What have you to say, Bingley?"    Mr. Crocker drew himself up.
    "Just this!" he said.
 "I'm an American citizen, and the way I've  figured it out is that my place is in America.
 It's no good  talking about it, Eugenia.
 I'm sorry if it upsets your plans, but  I--am--not--going--back--to--London!" He eyed his speechless wife  unflatteringly.
 "I'm going to stick on here and see the pennant  race out.
 And after that I'm going to take in the World's  Series.
"    Mrs. Crocker opened her mouth to speak, closed it, re-opened it.
  Then she found that she had nothing to say.
    "I hope you'll be sensible, Eugenia, and stay on this side, and  we can all be happy.
 I'm sorry to have to take this stand, but  you tried me too high.
 You're a woman, and you don't know what it  is to go five years without seeing a ball game; but take it from  me it's more than any real fan can stand.
 It nearly killed me,  and I'm not going to risk it again.
 If Mr. Pett will keep me on  as his butler, I'll stay here in this house.
 If he won't, I'll  get another job somewhere.
 But, whatever happens, I stick to this  side!"    Mr. Pett uttered a whoop of approval.
    "There's always been a place for you in my house, old man!" he  cried.
 "When I get a butler who--"    "But, Bingley! How can you be a butler?"    "You ought to watch him!" said Mr. Pett enthusiastically.
 "He's a  wonder! He can pull all the starchy stuff as if he'd lived with  the Duke of Whoosis for the last forty years, and then go right  off and fling a pop-bottle at an umpire! He's all right!"    The eulogy was wasted on Mrs. Crocker.
 She burst into tears.
 It  was a new experience for her husband, and he watched her  awkwardly, his resolute demeanour crumbling under this unexpected  assault.
    "Eugenia!"    Mrs. Crocker wiped her eyes.
    "I can't stand it!" she sobbed.
 "I've worked and worked all these  years, and now, just as success has nearly come--Bingley, _do_  come back! It will only be for a little longer.
"    Mr. Crocker stared.
    "A little longer? Why, that Lord Percy Whipple business--I know  you must have had excellent reasons for soaking him, Jimmy, but  it did put the lid on it--surely, after that Lord Percy affair  there's no chance--?"    "There is! There is! It has made no difference at all! Lord Percy  came to call next day with a black eye, poor boy!--and said that  James was a sportsman and that he wanted to know him better! He  said he had never felt so drawn towards any one in his life and  he wanted him to show him how he made some blow which he called a  right hook.
 The whole affair has simply endeared James to him,  and Lady Corstorphine says that the Duke of Devizes read the  account of the fight to the Premier that very evening and they  both laughed till they nearly got apoplexy.
"    Jimmy was deeply touched.
 He had not suspected such a sporting  spirit in his antagonist.
    "Percy's all right.
" he said enthusiastically.
 "Dad, you ought to  go back.
 It's only fair.
"    "But, Jimmy! Surely _you_ can understand? There's only a game  separating the Giants and the Phillies, with the Braves coming  along just behind.
 And the season only half over!"    Mrs. Crocker looked imploringly at him.
    "It will only be for a little while, Bingley.
 Lady Corstorphine,  who has means of knowing, says that your name is certain to be in  the next Honours List.
 After that you can come back as often as  you like.
 We could spend the summer here and the winter in  England, or whatever you pleased.
"    Mr. Crocker capitulated.
    "All right, Eugenia.
 I'll come.
"    "Bingley! We shall have to go back by the next boat, dear.
 People  are beginning to wonder where you are.
 I've told them that you  are taking a rest in the country.
 But they will suspect something  if you don't come back at once.
"    Mr. Crocker's face wore a drawn look.
 He had never felt so  attached to his wife as now, when she wept these unexpected tears  and begged favours of him with that unfamiliar catch in her  voice.
 On the other hand .
 .
 .
 A vision rose before him of the  Polo Grounds on a warm afternoon.
 .
 .
 .
 He crushed it down.
    "Very well," he said.
    Mr. Pett offered a word of consolation.
    "Maybe you'll be able to run over for the World's Series?"    Mr. Crocker's face cleared.
    "That's true.
"    "And I'll cable you the scores every day, dad," said Jimmy.
    Mrs. Crocker looked at him with a touch of disapproval clouding  the happiness of her face.
    "Are you staying over here, James? There is no reason why you  should not come back, too.
 If you make up your mind to change  your habits--"    "I have made up my mind to change them.
 But I'm going to do it in  New York.
 Mr. Pett is going to give me a job in his office.
 I am  going to start at the bottom and work my way still further down.
"    Mr. Pett yapped with rapture.
 He was experiencing something of  the emotion of the preacher at the camp-meeting who sees the  Sinners' Bench filling up.
 To have secured Willie Partridge, whom  he intended to lead gradually into the realms of high finance by  way of envelope-addressing, was much.
 But that Jimmy, with a  choice in the matter, should have chosen the office filled him  with such content that he only just stopped himself from dancing  on his bad foot.
    "Don't worry about me, dad.
 I shall do wonders.
 It's quite easy  to make a large fortune.
 I watched uncle Pete in his office this  morning, and all he does is sit at a mahogany table and tell the  office-boy to tell callers that he has gone away for the day.
 I  think I ought to rise to great heights in that branch of  industry.
 From the little I have seen of it, it seems to have  been made for me!"            EVERYBODY HAPPY    Jimmy looked at Ann.
 They were alone.
 Mr. Pett had gone back to  bed, Mrs. Crocker to her hotel.
 Mr. Crocker was removing his  make-up in his room.
 A silence had followed their departure.
    "This is the end of a perfect day!" said Jimmy.
    Ann took a step towards the door.
    "Don't go!"    Ann stopped.
    "Mr. Crocker!" she said.
    "Jimmy," he corrected.
    "Mr. Crocker!" repeated Ann firmly.
    "Or Algernon, if you prefer it.
"    "May I ask--" Ann regarded him steadily.
 "May I ask.
"    "Nearly always," said Jimmy, "when people begin with that, they  are going to say something unpleasant.
"    "May I ask why you went to all this trouble to make a fool of me?  Why could you not have told me who you were from the start?"    "Have you forgotten all the harsh things you said to me from time  to time about Jimmy Crocker? I thought that, if you knew who I  was, you would have nothing more to do with me.
"    "You were quite right.
"    "Surely, though, you won't let a thing that happened five years  ago make so much difference?"    "I shall never forgive you!"    "And yet, a little while ago, when Willie's bomb was about to go  off, you flung yourself into my arms!"    Ann's face flamed.
    "I lost my balance.
"    "Why try to recover it?"    Ann bit her lip.
    "You did a cruel, heartless thing.
 What does it matter how long  ago it was? If you were capable of it then--"    "Be reasonable.
 Don't you admit the possibility of reformation?  Take your own case.
 Five years ago you were a minor poetess.
 Now  you are an amateur kidnapper--a bright, lovable girl at whose  approach people lock up their children and sit on the key.
 As for  me, five years ago I was a heartless brute.
 Now I am a sober  serious business-man, specially called in by your uncle to help  jack up his tottering firm.
 Why not bury the dead past?  Besides--I don't want to praise myself, I just want to call your  attention to it--think what I have done for you.
 You admitted  yourself that it was my influence that had revolutionised your  character.
 But for me, you would now be doing worse than write  poetry.
 You would be writing _vers libre_.
 I saved you from that.
  And you spurn me!"    "I hate you!" said Ann.
    Jimmy went to the writing-desk and took up a small book.
    "Put that down!"    "I just wanted to read you 'Love's Funeral!' It illustrates my  point.
 Think of yourself as you are now, and remember that it is  I who am responsible for the improvement.
 Here we are.
 'Love's  Funeral.
' 'My heart is dead.
 .
 .
 .
' "    Ann snatched the book from his hands and flung it away.
 It soared  up, clearing the gallery rails, and fell with a thud on the  gallery floor.
 She stood facing him with sparkling eyes.
 Then she  moved away.
    "I beg your pardon," she said stiffly.
 "I lost my temper.
"    "It's your hair," said Jimmy soothingly.
 "You're bound to be  quick-tempered with hair of that glorious red shade.
 You must  marry some nice, determined fellow, blue-eyed, dark-haired,  clean-shaven, about five foot eleven, with a future in business.
  He will keep you in order.
"    "Mr. Crocker!"    "Gently, of course.
 Kindly-lovingly.
 The velvet thingummy rather  than the iron what's-its-name.
 But nevertheless firmly.
"    Ann was at the door.
    "To a girl with your ardent nature some one with whom you can  quarrel is an absolute necessity of life.
 You and I are  affinities.
 Ours will be an ideally happy marriage.
 You would be  miserable if you had to go through life with a human doormat with  'Welcome' written on him.
 You want some one made of sterner  stuff.
 You want, as it were, a sparring-partner, some one with  whom you can quarrel happily with the certain knowledge that he  will not curl up in a ball for you to kick, but will be there  with the return wallop.
 I may have my faults--" He paused  expectantly.
 Ann remained silent.
 "No, no!" he went on.
 "But I am  such a man.
 Brisk give-and-take is the foundation of the happy  marriage.
 Do you remember that beautiful line of Tennyson's--'We  fell out, my wife and I'? It always conjures up for me a vision  of wonderful domestic happiness.
 I seem to see us in our old age,  you on one side of the radiator, I on the other, warming our old  limbs and thinking up snappy stuff to hand to each  other--sweethearts still! If I were to go out of your life now,  you would be miserable.
 You would have nobody to quarrel with.
  You would be in the position of the female jaguar of the Indian  jungle, who, as you doubtless know, expresses her affection for  her mate by biting him shrewdly in the fleshy part of the leg, if  she should snap sideways one day and find nothing there.
"    Of all the things which Ann had been trying to say during this  discourse, only one succeeded in finding expression.
 To her  mortification, it was the only weak one in the collection.
    "Are you asking me to marry you?"    "I am.
"    "I won't!"    "You think so now, because I am not appearing at my best.
 You see  me nervous, diffident, tongue-tied.
 All this will wear off,  however, and you will be surprised and delighted as you begin to  understand my true self.
 Beneath the surface--I speak  conservatively--I am a corker!"    The door banged behind Ann.
 Jimmy found himself alone.
 He walked  thoughtfully to Mr. Pett's armchair and sat down.
 There was a  feeling of desolation upon him.
 He lit a cigarette and began to  smoke pensively.
 What a fool he had been to talk like that! What  girl of spirit could possibly stand it? If ever there had been a  time for being soothing and serious and pleading, it had been  these last few minutes.
 And he talked like that!    Ten minutes passed.
 Jimmy sprang from his chair.
 He thought he  had heard a footstep.
 He flung the door open.
 The passage was  empty.
 He returned miserably to his chair.
 Of course she had not  come back.
 Why should she?    A voice spoke.
    "Jimmy!"    He leaped up again, and looked wildly round.
 Then he looked up.
  Ann was leaning over the gallery rail.
    "Jimmy, I've been thinking it over.
 There's something I want to  ask you.
 Do you admit that you behaved abominably five years  ago?"    "Yes!" shouted Jimmy.
    "And that you've been behaving just as badly ever since?"    "Yes!"    "And that you are really a pretty awful sort of person?"    "Yes!"    "Then it's all right.
 You deserve it!"    "Deserve it?"    "Deserve to marry a girl like me.
 I was worried about it, but now  I see that it's the only punishment bad enough for you!" She  raised her arm.
    "Here's the dead past, Jimmy! Go and bury it! Good-night!"    A small book fell squashily at Jimmy's feet.
 He regarded it dully  for a moment.
 Then, with a wild yell which penetrated even to Mr.  Pett's bedroom and woke that sufferer just as he was dropping off  to sleep for the third time that night he bounded for the gallery  stairs.
    At the further end of the gallery a musical laugh sounded, and a  door closed.
 Ann had gone.
                --------------------------------    Transcriber's Notes for edition 11:    I am greatly indebted to the Wodehouse readers from the BLANDINGS  e-mail group who did such detailed research on this text, not only  on simple typos but on the differences between the 1916 Saturday  Evening Post serialization and the US and UK early printings.
    I have made use, in this new PG edition, of the 1918 UK first edition  references provided by these helpful savants, to correct misprints or  other publisher's errors in the US edition, but I have otherwise  followed the US edition.
    The punctuation is somewhat different from the UK versions, notably in  its use of colons.
 The words "Uncle" and "Aunt", where used with a name  ("Uncle Peter", "Aunt Nesta"), were capitalized in the original  serialized and UK editions, but lower-cased in the US edition, so I have  retained the lower-case.
    I have also restored some _italics_ omitted in the previous PG edition.
    I note below some significant differences between the early printings:    :   ""Well played, sir!" when they meant "'at-a-boy!""    "mean" is in the US edition; other editions have "meant".
    :   "Regent's bill-of-fare" has been corrected from "Regent's bill-of-fair"    in the US edition.
   "pull some boner" has been corrected from "pull some bone"    in the US edition.
    :   "Before his stony eye the immaculate Bartling wilted.
   It was a perfectly astounding likeness, but it was   apparent to him when what he had ever heard and read   about doubles came to him.
"    This is a somewhat clumsy construction, and quite un-Wodehousian.
  The original passage in the serialization read:     "Before his stony eye the immaculate Bartling wilted.
 All that   he had ever heard and read about doubles came to him.

         Produced by Christopher Hapka            A FAIR PENITENT    By Wilkie Collins          About "A Fair Penitent"    This story first appeared in Charles Dickens' magazine, "Household  Words," volume 16, number 382, July 18, 1857.
 Published anonymously, as  all contributions to the magazine were, it was attributed definitely  to Wilkie Collins by Anne Lohrli in her analysis of the magazine's  financial accounts.
          A FAIR PENITENT      Charles Pineau Duclos was a French writer of biographies and novels,  who lived and worked during the first half of the eighteenth century.
 He  prospered sufficiently well, as a literary man, to be made secretary to  the French Academy, and to be allowed to succeed Voltaire in the  office of historiographer of France.
 He has left behind him, in his  own country, the reputation of a lively writer of the second class, who  addressed the public of his day with fair success, and who, since his  death, has not troubled posterity to take any particular notice of him.
    Among the papers left by Duclos, two manuscripts were found, which he  probably intended to turn to some literary account.
 The first was a  brief Memoir, written by himself, of a Frenchwoman, named Mademoiselle  Gautier, who began life as an actress and who ended it as a Carmelite  nun.
 The second manuscript was the lady's own account of the process  of her conversion, and of the circumstances which attended her moral  passage from the state of a sinner to the state of a saint.
 There are  certain national peculiarities in the character of Mademoiselle Gautier  and in the narrative of her conversion, which are perhaps interesting  enough to be reproduced with some chance of pleasing the present day.
    It appears, from the account given of her by Duclos, that Mademoiselle  Gautier made her appearance on the stage of the Theatre Francois in  the year seventeen hundred and sixteen.
 She is described as a handsome  woman, with a fine figure, a fresh complexion, a lively disposition, and  a violent temper.
 Besides possessing capacity as an actress, she could  write very good verses, she was clever at painting in miniature, and,  most remarkable quality of all, she was possessed of prodigious muscular  strength.
 It is recorded of Mademoiselle, that she could roll up  a silver plate with her hands, and that she covered herself with  distinction in a trial of strength with no less a person than the famous  soldier, Marshal Saxe.
    Nobody who is at all acquainted with the social history of the  eighteenth century in France, need be told that Mademoiselle Gautier had  a long list of lovers,--for the most part, persons of quality, marshals,  counts, and so forth.
 The only man, however, who really attached her to  him, was an actor at the Theatre Francois, a famous player in his day,  named Quinault Dufresne.
 Mademoiselle Gautier seems to have loved him  with all the ardour of her naturally passionate disposition.
 At first,  he returned her affection; but, as soon as she ventured to test the  sincerity of his attachment by speaking of marriage, he cooled towards  her immediately, and the connection between them was broken off.
 In all  her former love-affairs, she had been noted for the high tone which she  adopted towards her admirers, and for the despotic authority which she  exercised over them even in her gayest moments.
 But the severance of  her connection with Quinault Dufresne wounded her to her heart.
 She  had loved the man so dearly, had made so many sacrifices for him, had  counted so fondly on the devotion of her whole future life to him, that  the first discovery of his coldness towards her broke her spirit at once  and for ever.
 She fell into a condition of hopeless melancholy, looked  back with remorse and horror at her past life, and abandoned the stage  and the society in which she had lived, to end her days repentantly in  the character of a Carmelite nun.
    So far, her history is the history of hundreds of other women before her  time and after it.
 The prominent interest of her life, for the student  of human nature, lies in the story of her conversion, as told by  herself.
 The greater part of the narrative--every page of which is more  or less characteristic of the Frenchwoman of the eighteenth century--may  be given, with certain suppressions and abridgments, in her own words.
  The reader will observe, at the outset, one curious fact.
 Mademoiselle  Gautier does not so much as hint at the influence which the loss of  her lover had in disposing her mind to reflect on serious subjects.
  She describes her conversion as if it had taken its rise in a sudden  inspiration from Heaven.
 Even the name of Quinault Dufresne is not once  mentioned from one end of her narrative to the other.
      On the twenty-fifth of April, seventeen hundred and twenty-two  (writes Mademoiselle Gautier), while I was still leading a life of  pleasure--according to the pernicious ideas of pleasure which pass  current in the world--I happen to awake, contrary to my usual custom,  between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.
 I remember that it is my  birthday; I ring for my people; and my maid answers the bell, alarmed by  the idea that I am ill.
 I tell her to dress me that I may go to mass.
 I  go to the Church of the Cordeliers, followed by my footman, and taking  with me a little orphan whom I had adopted.
 The first part of the mass  is celebrated without attracting my attention; but, at the second part  the accusing voice of my conscience suddenly begins to speak.
 "What  brings you here?" it says.
 "Do you come to reward God for making you the  attractive person that you are, by mortally transgressing His laws  every day of your life?" I hear that question, and I am unspeakably  overwhelmed by it.
 I quit the chair on which I have hitherto been  leaning carelessly, and I prostrate myself in an agony of remorse on the  pavement of the church.
    The mass over, I send home the footman and the orphan, remaining behind  myself, plunged in inconceivable perplexity.
 At last I rouse myself on  a sudden; I go to the sacristy; I demand a mass for my own proper  advantage every day; I determine to attend it regularly; and, after  three hours of agitation, I return home, resolved to enter on the path  that leads to justification.
    Six months passed.
 Every morning I went to my mass: every evening I  spent in my customary dissipations.
    Some of my friends indulged in considerable merriment at my expense when  they found out my constant attendance at mass.
 Accordingly, I disguised  myself as a boy, when I went to church, to escape observation.
 My  disguise was found out, and the jokes against me were redoubled.
 Upon  this, I began to think of the words of the Gospel, which declare the  impossibility of serving two masters.
 I determined to abandon the  service of Mammon.
    The first vanity I gave up was the vanity of keeping a maid.
 By way of  further accustoming myself to the retreat from the world which I now  began to meditate, I declined all invitations to parties under the  pretext of indisposition.
 But the nearer the Easter time approached at  which I had settled in my own mind definitely to turn my back on worldly  temptations and pleasures, the more violent became my internal struggles  with myself.
 My health suffered under them to such an extent that I  was troubled with perpetual attacks of retching and sickness, which,  however, did not prevent me from writing my general confession,  addressed to the vicar of Saint Sulpice, the parish in which I lived.
    Just Heaven! what did I not suffer some days afterwards, when I united  around me at dinner, for the last time, all the friends who had been  dearest to me in the days of my worldly life! What words can describe  the tumult of my heart when one of my guests said to me, "You are giving  us too good a dinner for a Wednesday in Passion Week;" and when another  answered, jestingly, "You forget that this is her farewell dinner to her  friends!" I felt ready to faint while they were talking, and rose  from table pretexting as an excuse, that I had a payment to make that  evening, which I could not in honour defer any longer.
 The company rose  with me, and saw me to the door.
 I got into my carriage, and the company  returned to table.
 My nerves were in such a state that I shrieked at the  first crack of the coachman's whip; and the company came running down  again to know what was the matter.
 One of my servants cleverly stopped  them from all hurrying out to the carriage together, by declaring that  the scream proceeded from my adopted orphan.
 Upon this they returned  quietly enough to their wine, and I drove off with my general confession  to the vicar of Saint Sulpice.
    My interview with the vicar lasted three hours.
 His joy at discovering  that I was in a state of grace was extreme.
 My own emotions were quite  indescribable.
 Late at night I returned to my own house, and found my  guests all gone.
 I employed myself in writing farewell letters to  the manager and company of the theatre, and in making the necessary  arrangements for sending back my adopted orphan to his friends, with  twenty pistoles.
 Finally, I directed the servants to say, if anybody  enquired after me the next day, that I had gone out of town for some  time; and after that, at five o'clock in the morning, I left my home in  Paris never to return to it again.
    By this time I had thoroughly recovered my tranquillity.
 I was as easy  in my mind at leaving my house as I am now when I quit my cell to sing  in the choir.
 Such already was the happy result of my perpetual masses,  my general confession, and my three hours' interview with the vicar of  Saint Sulpice.
    Before taking leave of the world, I went to Versailles to say good-bye  to my worthy patrons, Cardinal Fleury and the Duke de Gesvres.
 From  them, I went to mass in the King's Chapel; and after that, I called on  a lady of Versailles whom I had mortally offended, for the purpose of  making my peace with her.
 She received me angrily enough.
 I told her I  had not come to justify myself, but to ask her pardon.
 If she granted  it, she would send me away happy.
 If she declined to be reconciled,  Providence would probably be satisfied with my submission, but certainly  not with her refusal.
 She felt the force of this argument; and we made  it up on the spot.
    I left Versailles immediately afterwards, without taking anything to  eat; the act of humility which I had just performed being as good as a  meal to me.
    Towards evening, I entered the house of the Community of Saint Perpetua  at Paris.
 I had ordered a little room to be furnished there for me,  until the inventory of my worldly effects was completed, and until  I could conclude my arrangements for entering a convent.
 On first  installing myself, I began to feel hungry at last, and begged the  Superior of the Community to give me for supper anything that remained  from the dinner of the house.
 They had nothing but a little stewed  carp, of which I eat with an excellent appetite.
 Marvellous to relate,  although I had been able to keep nothing on my stomach for the past  three months, although I had been dreadfully sick after a little rice  soup on the evening before, the stewed carp of the sisterhood of  Saint Perpetua, with some nuts afterwards for dessert, agreed with me  charmingly, and I slept all through the night afterwards as peacefully  as a child!    When the news of my retirement became public, it occasioned great talk  in Paris.
 Various people assigned various reasons for the strange course  that I had taken.
 Nobody, however, believed that I had quitted the world  in the prime of my life (I was then thirty-one years old), never to  return to it again.
 Meanwhile, my inventory was finished and my goods  were sold.
 One of my friends sent a letter, entreating me to reconsider  my determination.
 My mind was made up, and I wrote to say so.
 When my  goods had been all sold, I left Paris to go and live incognito as a  parlour-boarder in the Convent of the Ursuline nuns of Pondevaux.
 Here  I wished to try the mode of life for a little while before I assumed the  serious responsibility of taking the veil.
 I knew my own character--I  remembered my early horror of total seclusion, and my inveterate dislike  to the company of women only; and, moved by these considerations, I  resolved, now that I had taken the first important step, to proceed in  the future with caution.
    The nuns of Pondevaux received me among them with great kindness.
 They  gave me a large room, which I partitioned off into three small ones.
  I assisted at all the pious exercises of the place.
 Deceived by my  fashionable appearance and my plump figure, the good nuns treated me  as if I was a person of high distinction.
 This afflicted me, and I  undeceived them.
 When they knew who I really was, they only behaved  towards me with still greater kindness.
 I passed my time in reading and  praying, and led the quietest, sweetest life it is possible to conceive.
    After ten months' sojourn at Pondevaux, I went to Lyons, and entered  (still as parlour-boarder only) the House of Anticaille, occupied by the  nuns of the Order of Saint Mary.
 Here, I enjoyed the advantage of having  for director of my conscience that holy man, Father Deveaux.
 He belonged  to the Order of the Jesuits; and he was good enough, when I first asked  him for advice, to suggest that I should get up at eleven o'clock at  night to say my prayers, and should remain absorbed in devotion until  midnight.
 In obedience to the directions of this saintly person, I kept  myself awake as well as I could till eleven o'clock.
 I then got on my  knees with great fervour, and I blush to confess it, immediately fell as  fast asleep as a dormouse.
 This went on for several nights, when Father  Deveaux finding that my midnight devotions were rather too much for me,  was so obliging as to prescribe another species of pious exercise, in  a letter which he wrote to me with his own hand.
 The holy father, after  deeply regretting my inability to keep awake, informed me that he had  a new act of penitence to suggest to me by the performance of which I  might still hope to expiate my sins.
 He then, in the plainest terms,  advised me to have recourse to the discipline of flagellation, every  Friday, using the cat-o'-nine-tails on my bare shoulders for the length  of time that it would take to repeat a Miserere.
 In conclusion, he  informed me that the nuns of Anticaille would probably lend me the  necessary instrument of flagellation; but, if they made any difficulty  about it, he was benevolently ready to furnish me with a new and special  cat-o'-nine-tails of his own making.
    Never was woman more amazed or more angry than I, when I first read this  letter.
 "What!" cried I to myself, "does this man seriously recommend me  to lash my own shoulders? Just Heaven, what impertinence! And yet, is it  not my duty to put up with it? Does not this apparent insolence proceed  from the pen of a holy man? If he tells me to flog my wickedness out of  me, is it not my bounden duty to lay on the scourge with all my might  immediately? Sinner that I am! I am thinking remorsefully of my plump  shoulders and the dimples on my back, when I ought to be thinking of  nothing but the cat-o'-nine-tails and obedience to Father Deveaux?"    These reflections soon gave me the resolution which I had wanted at  first.
 I was ashamed to ask the nuns for an instrument of flagellation;  so I made one for myself of stout cord, pitilessly knotted at very short  intervals.
 This done, I shut myself up while the nuns were at prayer,  uncovered my shoulders, and rained such a shower of lashes on them,  in the first fervour of my newly-awakened zeal, that I fairly flogged  myself down on the ground, flat on my nose, before I had repeated more  of the Miserere than the first two or three lines.
    I burst out crying, shedding tears of spite against myself when I ought  to have been shedding tears of devotional gratitude for the kindness of  Father Deveaux.
 All through the night I never closed my eyes, and in the  morning I found my poor shoulders (once so generally admired for their  whiteness) striped with all the colours of the rainbow.
 The sight threw  me into a passion, and I profanely said to myself while I was dressing,  "The next time I see Father Deveaux, I will give my tongue full swing,  and make the hair of that holy man stand on end with terror!" A few  hours afterwards, he came to the convent, and all my resolution melted  away at the sight of him.
 His imposing exterior had such an effect on  me that I could only humbly entreat him to excuse me from indicting a  second flagellation on myself.
 He smiled, benignantly, and granted my  request with a saintly amiability.
 "Give me the cat-o'-nine-tails," he  said, in conclusion, "and I will keep it for you till you ask me for it  again.
 You are sure to ask for it again, dear child--to ask for it on  your bended knees!"    Pious and prophetic man! Before many days had passed his words came  true.
 If he had persisted severely in ordering me to flog myself, I  might have opposed him for months together; but, as it was, who could  resist the amiable indulgence he showed towards my weakness? The  very next day after my interview, I began to feel ashamed of my own  cowardice; and the day after that I went down on my knees, exactly as  he had predicted, and said, "Father Deveaux, give me back my  cat-o'-nine-tails.
" From that time I cheerfully underwent the discipline  of flagellation, learning the regular method of practising it from the  sisterhood, and feeling, in a spiritual point of view, immensely the  better for it.
    The nuns, finding that I cheerfully devoted myself to every act of  self-sacrifice prescribed by the rules of their convent, wondered very  much that I still hesitated about taking the veil.
 I begged them not to  mention the subject to me till my mind was quite made up about it.
 They  respected my wish, and said no more; but they lent me books to read  which assisted in strengthening my wavering resolution.
 Among these  books was the Life of Madame de Montmorenci, who, after the shocking  death of her husband, entered the Order of St.
 Mary.
 The great example  of this lady made me reflect seriously, and I communicated my thoughts,  as a matter of course, to Father Deveaux.
 He assured me that the one  last greatest sacrifice which remained for me to make was the sacrifice  of my liberty.
 I had long known that this was my duty, and I now felt,  for the first time, that I had courage and resolution enough boldly to  face the idea of taking the veil.
    While I was in this happy frame of mind, I happened to meet with the  history of the famous Rance, founder, or rather reformer, of the Order  of La Trappe.
 I found a strange similarity between my own worldly errors  and those of this illustrious penitent.
 The discovery had such an effect  on me, that I spurned all idea of entering a convent where the rules  were comparatively easy, as was the case at Anticaille, and determined,  when I did take the veil, to enter an Order whose discipline was as  severe as the discipline of La Trappe itself.
 Father Deveaux informed me  that I should find exactly what I wanted among the Carmelite nuns;  and, by his advice, I immediately put myself in communication with  the Archbishop of Villeroi.
 I opened my heart to this worthy prelate,  convinced him of my sincerity, and gained from him a promise that he  would get me admitted among the Carmelite nuns of Lyons.
 One thing I  begged of him at parting, which was, that he would tell the whole truth  about my former life and about the profession that I had exercised in  the world.
 I was resolved to deceive nobody, and to enter no convent  under false pretences of any sort.
    My wishes were scrupulously fulfilled; and the nuns were dreadfully  frightened when they heard that I had been an actress at Paris.
 But the  Archbishop promising to answer for me, and to take all their scruples  on his own conscience, they consented to receive me.
 I could not trust  myself to take formal leave of the nuns of Anticaille, who had been  so kind to me, and towards whom I felt so gratefully.
 So I wrote my  farewell to them after privately leaving their house, telling them  frankly the motives which animated me, and asking their pardon for  separating myself from them in secret.
    On the fourteenth of October, seventeen hundred and twenty-four, I  entered the Carmelite convent at Lyons, eighteen months after my flight  from the world, and my abandonment of my profession--to adopt which, I  may say, in my own defence, that I was first led through sheer poverty.
  At the age of seventeen years, and possessing (if I may credit report)  remarkable personal charms, I was left perfectly destitute through the  spendthrift habits of my father.
 I was easily persuaded to go on the  stage, and soon tempted, with my youth and inexperience, to lead an  irregular life.
 I do not wish to assert that dissipation necessarily  follows the choice of the actress's profession, for I have known many  estimable women on the stage.
 I, unhappily, was not one of the number.
 I  confess it to my shame, and, as the chief of sinners, I am only the more  grateful to the mercy of Heaven which accomplished my conversion.
    When I entered the convent, I entreated the prioress to let me live in  perfect obscurity, without corresponding with my friends, or even with  my relations.
 She declined to grant this last request, thinking that  my zeal was leading me too far.
 On the other hand, she complied with  my wish to be employed at once, without the slightest preparatory  indulgence or consideration, on any menial labour which the discipline  of the convent might require from me.
 On the first day of my admission a  broom was put into my hands.
 I was appointed also to wash up the dishes,  to scour the saucepans, to draw water from a deep well, to carry each  sister's pitcher to its proper place, and to scrub the tables in the  refectory.
 From these occupations I got on in time to making rope  shoes for the sisterhood, and to taking care of the great clock of the  convent; this last employment requiring me to pull up three immensely  heavy weights regularly every day.
 Seven years of my life passed in this  hard work, and I can honestly say that I never murmured over it.
    To return, however, to the period of my admission into the convent.
    After three months of probation, I took the veil on the twentieth of  January, seventeen hundred and twenty-five.
 The Archbishop did me the  honour to preside at the ceremony; and, in spite of the rigour of the  season, all Lyons poured into the church to see me take the vows.
 I was  deeply affected; but I never faltered in my resolution.
 I pronounced the  oaths with a firm voice, and with a tranquillity which astonished all  the spectators,--a tranquillity which has never once failed me since  that time.
    Such is the story of my conversion.
 Providence sent me into the  world with an excellent nature, with a true heart, with a remarkable  susceptibility to the influence of estimable sentiments.
 My parents  neglected my education, and left me in the world, destitute of  everything but youth, beauty, and a lively temperament.
 I tried hard to  be virtuous; I vowed, before I was out of my teens, and when I happened  to be struck down by a serious illness, to leave the stage, and to keep  my reputation unblemished, if anybody would only give me two hundred  livres a year to live upon.
 Nobody came forward to help me, and I fell.
    Heaven pardon the rich people of Paris who might have preserved my  virtue at so small a cost! Heaven grant me courage to follow the better  path into which its mercy has led me, and to persevere in a life of  penitence and devotion to the end of my days!      So this singular confession ends.
 Besides the little vanities and  levities which appear here and there on its surface, there is surely a  strong under-current of sincerity and frankness which fit it to appeal  in some degree to the sympathy as well as the curiosity of the reader.
  It is impossible to read the narrative without feeling that there must  have been something really genuine and hearty in Mademoiselle Gautier's  nature; and it is a gratifying proof of the honest integrity of her  purpose to know that she persevered to the last in the life of humility  and seclusion which her conscience had convinced her was the best life  that she could lead.
 Persons who knew her in the Carmelite convent,  report that she lived and died in it, preserving to the last, all the  better part of the youthful liveliness of her character.
 She always  received visitors with pleasure, always talked to them with surprising  cheerfulness, always assisted the poor, and always willingly wrote  letters to her former patrons in Paris to help the interests of her  needy friends.
 Towards the end of her life, she was afflicted with  blindness; but she was a trouble to no one in consequence of this  affliction, for she continued, in spite of it, to clean her own cell,  to make her own bed, and to cook her own food just as usual.
 One little  characteristic vanity--harmless enough, surely?--remained with her to  the last.
 She never forgot her own handsome face, which all Paris had  admired in the by-gone time; and she contrived to get a dispensation  from the Pope which allowed her to receive visitors in the convent  parlour without a veil.
