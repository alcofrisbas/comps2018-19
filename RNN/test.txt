 HOW THE BLACK SHEEP CAME FORTH FROM THE FOLD.
      The great bell of Beaulieu was ringing.
 Far away through the forest  might be heard its musical clangor and swell.
 Peat-cutters on Blackdown  and fishers upon the Exe heard the distant throbbing rising and falling  upon the sultry summer air.
 It was a common sound in those parts--as  common as the chatter of the jays and the booming of the bittern.
 Yet  the fishers and the peasants raised their heads and looked questions at  each other, for the angelus had already gone and vespers was still far  off.
 Why should the great bell of Beaulieu toll when the shadows were  neither short nor long?    All round the Abbey the monks were trooping in.
 Under the long  green-paved avenues of gnarled oaks and of lichened beeches the  white-robed brothers gathered to the sound.
 From the vine-yard and  the vine-press, from the bouvary or ox-farm, from the marl-pits and  salterns, even from the distant iron-works of Sowley and the outlying  grange of St.
 Leonard's, they had all turned their steps homewards.
 It  had been no sudden call.
 A swift messenger had the night before sped  round to the outlying dependencies of the Abbey, and had left the  summons for every monk to be back in the cloisters by the third hour  after noontide.
 So urgent a message had not been issued within the  memory of old lay-brother Athanasius, who had cleaned the Abbey knocker  since the year after the Battle of Bannockburn.
    A stranger who knew nothing either of the Abbey or of its immense  resources might have gathered from the appearance of the brothers some  conception of the varied duties which they were called upon to perform,  and of the busy, wide-spread life which centred in the old monastery.
  As they swept gravely in by twos and by threes, with bended heads and  muttering lips there were few who did not bear upon them some signs of  their daily toil.
 Here were two with wrists and sleeves all spotted  with the ruddy grape juice.
 There again was a bearded brother with  a broad-headed axe and a bundle of faggots upon his shoulders, while  beside him walked another with the shears under his arm and the white  wool still clinging to his whiter gown.
 A long, straggling troop bore  spades and mattocks while the two rearmost of all staggered along under  a huge basket o' fresh-caught carp, for the morrow was Friday, and there  were fifty platters to be filled and as many sturdy trenchermen behind  them.
 Of all the throng there was scarce one who was not labor-stained  and weary, for Abbot Berghersh was a hard man to himself and to others.
    Meanwhile, in the broad and lofty chamber set apart for occasions of  import, the Abbot himself was pacing impatiently backwards and forwards,  with his long white nervous hands clasped in front of him.
 His thin,  thought-worn features and sunken, haggard cheeks bespoke one who had  indeed beaten down that inner foe whom every man must face, but had none  the less suffered sorely in the contest.
 In crushing his passions he had  well-nigh crushed himself.
 Yet, frail as was his person there gleamed  out ever and anon from under his drooping brows a flash of fierce  energy, which recalled to men's minds that he came of a fighting stock,  and that even now his twin-brother, Sir Bartholomew Berghersh, was one  of the most famous of those stern warriors who had planted the Cross of  St.
 George before the gates of Paris.
 With lips compressed and clouded  brow, he strode up and down the oaken floor, the very genius and  impersonation of asceticism, while the great bell still thundered and  clanged above his head.
 At last the uproar died away in three last,  measured throbs, and ere their echo had ceased the Abbot struck a small  gong which summoned a lay-brother to his presence.
    "Have the brethren come?" he asked, in the Anglo-French dialect used in  religious houses.
    "They are here," the other answered, with his eyes cast down and his  hands crossed upon his chest.
    "All?"    "Two and thirty of the seniors and fifteen of the novices, most holy  father.
 Brother Mark of the Spicarium is sore smitten with a fever and  could not come.
 He said that--"    "It boots not what he said.
 Fever or no, he should have come at my call.
  His spirit must be chastened, as must that of many more in this Abbey.
  You yourself, brother Francis, have twice raised your voice, so it hath  come to my ears, when the reader in the refectory hath been dealing with  the lives of God's most blessed saints.
 What hast thou to say?"    The lay-brother stood meek and silent, with his arms still crossed in  front of him.
    "One thousand Aves and as many Credos, said standing with arms  outstretched before the shrine of the Virgin, may help thee to remember  that the Creator hath given us two ears and but one mouth, as a token  that there is twice the work for the one as for the other.
 Where is the  master of the novices?"    "He is without, most holy father.
"    "Send him hither.
"    The sandalled feet clattered over the wooden floor, and the iron-bound  door creaked upon its hinges.
 In a few moments it opened again to admit  a short square monk with a heavy, composed face and an authoritative  manner.
    "You have sent for me, holy father?"    "Yes, brother Jerome, I wish that this matter be disposed of with as  little scandal as may be, and yet it is needful that the example should  be a public one.
" The Abbot spoke in Latin now, as a language which was  more fitted by its age and solemnity to convey the thoughts of two high  dignitaries of the order.
    "It would, perchance, be best that the novices be not admitted,"  suggested the master.
 "This mention of a woman may turn their minds from  their pious meditations to worldly and evil thoughts.
"    "Woman! woman!" groaned the Abbot.
 "Well has the holy Chrysostom termed  them _radix malorum_.
 From Eve downwards, what good hath come from any  of them? Who brings the plaint?"    "It is brother Ambrose.
"    "A holy and devout young man.
"    "A light and a pattern to every novice.
"    "Let the matter be brought to an issue then according to our old-time  monastic habit.
 Bid the chancellor and the sub-chancellor lead in the  brothers according to age, together with brother John, the accused, and  brother Ambrose, the accuser.
"    "And the novices?"    "Let them bide in the north alley of the cloisters.
 Stay! Bid the  sub-chancellor send out to them Thomas the lector to read unto them  from the 'Gesta beati Benedicti.
' It may save them from foolish and  pernicious babbling.
"    The Abbot was left to himself once more, and bent his thin gray face  over his illuminated breviary.
 So he remained while the senior monks  filed slowly and sedately into the chamber seating themselves upon the  long oaken benches which lined the wall on either side.
 At the further  end, in two high chairs as large as that of the Abbot, though hardly as  elaborately carved, sat the master of the novices and the chancellor,  the latter a broad and portly priest, with dark mirthful eyes and a  thick outgrowth of crisp black hair all round his tonsured head.
 Between  them stood a lean, white-faced brother who appeared to be ill at ease,  shifting his feet from side to side and tapping his chin nervously with  the long parchment roll which he held in his hand.
 The Abbot, from his  point of vantage, looked down on the two long lines of faces, placid and  sun-browned for the most part, with the large bovine eyes and unlined  features which told of their easy, unchanging existence.
 Then he turned  his eager fiery gaze upon the pale-faced monk who faced him.
    "This plaint is thine, as I learn, brother Ambrose," said he.
 "May the  holy Benedict, patron of our house, be present this day and aid us in  our findings! How many counts are there?"    "Three, most holy father," the brother answered in a low and quavering  voice.
    "Have you set them forth according to rule?"    "They are here set down, most holy father, upon a cantle of sheep-skin.
"    "Let the sheep-skin be handed to the chancellor.
 Bring in brother John,  and let him hear the plaints which have been urged against him.
"    At this order a lay-brother swung open the door, and two other  lay-brothers entered leading between them a young novice of the order.
  He was a man of huge stature, dark-eyed and red-headed, with a peculiar  half-humorous, half-defiant expression upon his bold, well-marked  features.
 His cowl was thrown back upon his shoulders, and his gown,  unfastened at the top, disclosed a round, sinewy neck, ruddy and corded  like the bark of the fir.
 Thick, muscular arms, covered with a reddish  down, protruded from the wide sleeves of his habit, while his white  shirt, looped up upon one side, gave a glimpse of a huge knotty leg,  scarred and torn with the scratches of brambles.
 With a bow to the  Abbot, which had in it perhaps more pleasantry than reverence, the  novice strode across to the carved prie-dieu which had been set apart  for him, and stood silent and erect with his hand upon the gold bell  which was used in the private orisons of the Abbot's own household.
 His  dark eyes glanced rapidly over the assembly, and finally settled with a  grim and menacing twinkle upon the face of his accuser.
    The chancellor rose, and having slowly unrolled the parchment-scroll,  proceeded to read it out in a thick and pompous voice, while a subdued  rustle and movement among the brothers bespoke the interest with which  they followed the proceedings.
    "Charges brought upon the second Thursday after the Feast of the  Assumption, in the year of our Lord thirteen hundred and sixty-six,  against brother John, formerly known as Hordle John, or John of Hordle,  but now a novice in the holy monastic order of the Cistercians.
 Read  upon the same day at the Abbey of Beaulieu in the presence of the most  reverend Abbot Berghersh and of the assembled order.
    "The charges against the said brother John are the following, namely, to  wit:    "First, that on the above-mentioned Feast of the Assumption, small beer  having been served to the novices in the proportion of one quart to  each four, the said brother John did drain the pot at one draught to  the detriment of brother Paul, brother Porphyry and brother Ambrose,  who could scarce eat their none-meat of salted stock-fish on account of  their exceeding dryness.
"    At this solemn indictment the novice raised his hand and twitched his  lip, while even the placid senior brothers glanced across at each other  and coughed to cover their amusement.
 The Abbot alone sat gray and  immutable, with a drawn face and a brooding eye.
    "Item, that having been told by the master of the novices that he should  restrict his food for two days to a single three-pound loaf of bran and  beans, for the greater honoring and glorifying of St.
 Monica, mother of  the holy Augustine, he was heard by brother Ambrose and others to say  that he wished twenty thousand devils would fly away with the said  Monica, mother of the holy Augustine, or any other saint who came  between a man and his meat.
 Item, that upon brother Ambrose reproving  him for this blasphemous wish, he did hold the said brother face  downwards over the piscatorium or fish-pond for a space during which  the said brother was able to repeat a pater and four aves for the better  fortifying of his soul against impending death.
"    There was a buzz and murmur among the white-frocked brethren at this  grave charge; but the Abbot held up his long quivering hand.
 "What  then?" said he.
    "Item, that between nones and vespers on the feast of James the Less the  said brother John was observed upon the Brockenhurst road, near the spot  which is known as Hatchett's Pond in converse with a person of the other  sex, being a maiden of the name of Mary Sowley, the daughter of the  King's verderer.
 Item, that after sundry japes and jokes the said  brother John did lift up the said Mary Sowley and did take, carry, and  convey her across a stream, to the infinite relish of the devil and the  exceeding detriment of his own soul, which scandalous and wilful falling  away was witnessed by three members of our order.
"    A dead silence throughout the room, with a rolling of heads and  upturning of eyes, bespoke the pious horror of the community.
    The Abbot drew his gray brows low over his fiercely questioning eyes.
    "Who can vouch for this thing?" he asked.
    "That can I," answered the accuser.
 "So too can brother Porphyry, who  was with me, and brother Mark of the Spicarium, who hath been so much  stirred and inwardly troubled by the sight that he now lies in a fever  through it.
"    "And the woman?" asked the Abbot.
 "Did she not break into lamentation  and woe that a brother should so demean himself?"    "Nay, she smiled sweetly upon him and thanked him.
 I can vouch it and so  can brother Porphyry.
"    "Canst thou?" cried the Abbot, in a high, tempestuous tone.
 "Canst thou  so? Hast forgotten that the five-and-thirtieth rule of the order is that  in the presence of a woman the face should be ever averted and the eyes  cast down? Hast forgot it, I say? If your eyes were upon your sandals,  how came ye to see this smile of which ye prate? A week in your cells,  false brethren, a week of rye-bread and lentils, with double lauds and  double matins, may help ye to remembrance of the laws under which ye  live.
"    At this sudden outflame of wrath the two witnesses sank their faces on  to their chests, and sat as men crushed.
 The Abbot turned his angry eyes  away from them and bent them upon the accused, who met his searching  gaze with a firm and composed face.
    "What hast thou to say, brother John, upon these weighty things which  are urged against you?"    "Little enough, good father, little enough," said the novice, speaking  English with a broad West Saxon drawl.
 The brothers, who were English  to a man, pricked up their ears at the sound of the homely and yet  unfamiliar speech; but the Abbot flushed red with anger, and struck his  hand upon the oaken arm of his chair.
    "What talk is this?" he cried.
 "Is this a tongue to be used within the  walls of an old and well-famed monastery? But grace and learning have  ever gone hand in hand, and when one is lost it is needless to look for  the other.
"    "I know not about that," said brother John.
 "I know only that the words  come kindly to my mouth, for it was the speech of my fathers before me.
  Under your favor, I shall either use it now or hold my peace.
"    The Abbot patted his foot and nodded his head, as one who passes a point  but does not forget it.
    "For the matter of the ale," continued brother John, "I had come in hot  from the fields and had scarce got the taste of the thing before  mine eye lit upon the bottom of the pot.
 It may be, too, that I spoke  somewhat shortly concerning the bran and the beans, the same being poor  provender and unfitted for a man of my inches.
 It is true also that I  did lay my hands upon this jack-fool of a brother Ambrose, though, as  you can see, I did him little scathe.
 As regards the maid, too, it is  true that I did heft her over the stream, she having on her hosen and  shoon, whilst I had but my wooden sandals, which could take no hurt from  the water.
 I should have thought shame upon my manhood, as well as my  monkhood, if I had held back my hand from her.
" He glanced around as  he spoke with the half-amused look which he had worn during the whole  proceedings.
    "There is no need to go further," said the Abbot.
 "He has confessed to  all.
 It only remains for me to portion out the punishment which is due  to his evil conduct.
"    He rose, and the two long lines of brothers followed his example,  looking sideways with scared faces at the angry prelate.
    "John of Hordle," he thundered, "you have shown yourself during the two  months of your novitiate to be a recreant monk, and one who is unworthy  to wear the white garb which is the outer symbol of the spotless spirit.
  That dress shall therefore be stripped from thee, and thou shalt be cast  into the outer world without benefit of clerkship, and without lot or  part in the graces and blessings of those who dwell under the care of  the Blessed Benedict.
 Thou shalt come back neither to Beaulieu nor to  any of the granges of Beaulieu, and thy name shall be struck off the  scrolls of the order.
"    The sentence appeared a terrible one to the older monks, who had become  so used to the safe and regular life of the Abbey that they would have  been as helpless as children in the outer world.
 From their pious  oasis they looked dreamily out at the desert of life, a place full of  stormings and strivings--comfortless, restless, and overshadowed by  evil.
 The young novice, however, appeared to have other thoughts, for  his eyes sparkled and his smile broadened.
 It needed but that to add  fresh fuel to the fiery mood of the prelate.
    "So much for thy spiritual punishment," he cried.
 "But it is to thy  grosser feelings that we must turn in such natures as thine, and as  thou art no longer under the shield of holy church there is the less  difficulty.
 Ho there! lay-brothers--Francis, Naomi, Joseph--seize him  and bind his arms! Drag him forth, and let the foresters and the porters  scourge him from the precincts!"    As these three brothers advanced towards him to carry out the Abbot's  direction, the smile faded from the novice's face, and he glanced right  and left with his fierce brown eyes, like a bull at a baiting.
 Then,  with a sudden deep-chested shout, he tore up the heavy oaken prie-dieu  and poised it to strike, taking two steps backward the while, that none  might take him at a vantage.
    "By the black rood of Waltham!" he roared, "if any knave among you lays  a finger-end upon the edge of my gown, I will crush his skull like a  filbert!" With his thick knotted arms, his thundering voice, and his  bristle of red hair, there was something so repellent in the man that  the three brothers flew back at the very glare of him; and the two rows  of white monks strained away from him like poplars in a tempest.
 The  Abbot only sprang forward with shining eyes; but the chancellor and the  master hung upon either arm and wrested him back out of danger's way.
    "He is possessed of a devil!" they shouted.
 "Run, brother Ambrose,  brother Joachim! Call Hugh of the Mill, and Woodman Wat, and Raoul with  his arbalest and bolts.
 Tell them that we are in fear of our lives! Run,  run! for the love of the Virgin!"    But the novice was a strategist as well as a man of action.
 Springing  forward, he hurled his unwieldy weapon at brother Ambrose, and, as desk  and monk clattered on to the floor together, he sprang through the open  door and down the winding stair.
 Sleepy old brother Athanasius, at  the porter's cell, had a fleeting vision of twinkling feet and flying  skirts; but before he had time to rub his eyes the recreant had passed  the lodge, and was speeding as fast as his sandals could patter along  the Lyndhurst Road.
        .
 HOW ALLEYNE EDRICSON CAME OUT INTO THE WORLD.
      Never had the peaceful atmosphere of the old Cistercian house been so  rudely ruffled.
 Never had there been insurrection so sudden, so short,  and so successful.
 Yet the Abbot Berghersh was a man of too firm a grain  to allow one bold outbreak to imperil the settled order of his great  household.
 In a few hot and bitter words, he compared their false  brother's exit to the expulsion of our first parents from the garden,  and more than hinted that unless a reformation occurred some others of  the community might find themselves in the same evil and perilous case.
  Having thus pointed the moral and reduced his flock to a fitting state  of docility, he dismissed them once more to their labors and withdrew  himself to his own private chamber, there to seek spiritual aid in the  discharge of the duties of his high office.
    The Abbot was still on his knees, when a gentle tapping at the door of  his cell broke in upon his orisons.
    Rising in no very good humor at the interruption, he gave the word to  enter; but his look of impatience softened down into a pleasant and  paternal smile as his eyes fell upon his visitor.
    He was a thin-faced, yellow-haired youth, rather above the middle size,  comely and well shapen, with straight, lithe figure and eager, boyish  features.
 His clear, pensive gray eyes, and quick, delicate expression,  spoke of a nature which had unfolded far from the boisterous joys and  sorrows of the world.
 Yet there was a set of the mouth and a prominence  of the chin which relieved him of any trace of effeminacy.
 Impulsive  he might be, enthusiastic, sensitive, with something sympathetic and  adaptive in his disposition; but an observer of nature's tokens would  have confidently pledged himself that there was native firmness and  strength underlying his gentle, monk-bred ways.
    The youth was not clad in monastic garb, but in lay attire, though his  jerkin, cloak and hose were all of a sombre hue, as befitted one who  dwelt in sacred precincts.
 A broad leather strap hanging from his  shoulder supported a scrip or satchel such as travellers were wont to  carry.
 In one hand he grasped a thick staff pointed and shod with metal,  while in the other he held his coif or bonnet, which bore in its front a  broad pewter medal stamped with the image of Our Lady of Rocamadour.
    "Art ready, then, fair son?" said the Abbot.
 "This is indeed a day of  comings and of goings.
 It is strange that in one twelve hours the Abbey  should have cast off its foulest weed and should now lose what we are  fain to look upon as our choicest blossom.
"    "You speak too kindly, father," the youth answered.
 "If I had my will I  should never go forth, but should end my days here in Beaulieu.
 It hath  been my home as far back as my mind can carry me, and it is a sore thing  for me to have to leave it.
"    "Life brings many a cross," said the Abbot gently.
 "Who is without them?  Your going forth is a grief to us as well as to yourself.
 But there  is no help.
 I had given my foreword and sacred promise to your father,  Edric the Franklin, that at the age of twenty you should be sent out  into the world to see for yourself how you liked the savor of it.
 Seat  thee upon the settle, Alleyne, for you may need rest ere long.
"    The youth sat down as directed, but reluctantly and with diffidence.
  The Abbot stood by the narrow window, and his long black shadow fell  slantwise across the rush-strewn floor.
    "Twenty years ago," he said, "your father, the Franklin of Minstead,  died, leaving to the Abbey three hides of rich land in the hundred of  Malwood, and leaving to us also his infant son on condition that we  should rear him until he came to man's estate.
 This he did partly  because your mother was dead, and partly because your elder brother,  now Socman of Minstead, had already given sign of that fierce and rude  nature which would make him no fit companion for you.
 It was his desire  and request, however, that you should not remain in the cloisters, but  should at a ripe age return into the world.
"    "But, father," interrupted the young man, "it is surely true that I am  already advanced several degrees in clerkship?"    "Yes, fair son, but not so far as to bar you from the garb you now wear  or the life which you must now lead.
 You have been porter?"    "Yes, father.
"    "Exorcist?"    "Yes, father.
"    "Reader?"    "Yes, father.
"    "Acolyte?"    "Yes, father.
"    "But have sworn no vow of constancy or chastity?"    "No, father.
"    "Then you are free to follow a worldly life.
 But let me hear, ere you  start, what gifts you take away with you from Beaulieu? Some I already  know.
 There is the playing of the citole and the rebeck.
 Our choir will  be dumb without you.
 You carve too?"    The youth's pale face flushed with the pride of the skilled workman.
  "Yes, holy father," he answered.
 "Thanks to good brother Bartholomew, I  carve in wood and in ivory, and can do something also in silver and  in bronze.
 From brother Francis I have learned to paint on vellum, on  glass, and on metal, with a knowledge of those pigments and essences  which can preserve the color against damp or a biting air.
 Brother  Luke hath given me some skill in damask work, and in the enamelling of  shrines, tabernacles, diptychs and triptychs.
 For the rest, I know a  little of the making of covers, the cutting of precious stones, and the  fashioning of instruments.
"    "A goodly list, truly," cried the superior with a smile.
 "What clerk of  Cambrig or of Oxenford could say as much? But of thy reading--hast not  so much to show there, I fear?"    "No, father, it hath been slight enough.
 Yet, thanks to our good  chancellor, I am not wholly unlettered.
 I have read Ockham, Bradwardine,  and other of the schoolmen, together with the learned Duns Scotus and  the book of the holy Aquinas.
"    "But of the things of this world, what have you gathered from your  reading? From this high window you may catch a glimpse over the wooden  point and the smoke of Bucklershard of the mouth of the Exe, and the  shining sea.
 Now, I pray you, Alleyne, if a man were to take a ship and  spread sail across yonder waters, where might he hope to arrive?"    The youth pondered, and drew a plan amongst the rushes with the point  of his staff.
 "Holy father," said he, "he would come upon those parts  of France which are held by the King's Majesty.
 But if he trended to the  south he might reach Spain and the Barbary States.
 To his north would be  Flanders and the country of the Eastlanders and of the Muscovites.
"    "True.
 And how if, after reaching the King's possessions, he still  journeyed on to the eastward?"    "He would then come upon that part of France which is still in dispute,  and he might hope to reach the famous city of Avignon, where dwells our  blessed father, the prop of Christendom.
"    "And then?"    "Then he would pass through the land of the Almains and the great Roman  Empire, and so to the country of the Huns and of the Lithuanian pagans,  beyond which lies the great city of Constantine and the kingdom of the  unclean followers of Mahmoud.
"    "And beyond that, fair son?"    "Beyond that is Jerusalem and the Holy Land, and the great river which  hath its source in the Garden of Eden.
"    "And then?"    "Nay, good father, I cannot tell.
 Methinks the end of the world is not  far from there.
"    "Then we can still find something to teach thee, Alleyne," said the  Abbot complaisantly.
 "Know that many strange nations lie betwixt there  and the end of the world.
 There is the country of the Amazons, and the  country of the dwarfs, and the country of the fair but evil women who  slay with beholding, like the basilisk.
 Beyond that again is the kingdom  of Prester John and of the great Cham.
 These things I know for very  sooth, for I had them from that pious Christian and valiant knight, Sir  John de Mandeville, who stopped twice at Beaulieu on his way to and from  Southampton, and discoursed to us concerning what he had seen from the  reader's desk in the refectory, until there was many a good brother who  got neither bit nor sup, so stricken were they by his strange tales.
"    "I would fain know, father," asked the young man, "what there may be at  the end of the world?"    "There are some things," replied the Abbot gravely, "into which it was  never intended that we should inquire.
 But you have a long road before  you.
 Whither will you first turn?"    "To my brother's at Minstead.
 If he be indeed an ungodly and violent  man, there is the more need that I should seek him out and see whether I  cannot turn him to better ways.
"    The Abbot shook his head.
 "The Socman of Minstead hath earned an evil  name over the country side," he said.
 "If you must go to him, see at  least that he doth not turn you from the narrow path upon which you have  learned to tread.
 But you are in God's keeping, and Godward should you  ever look in danger and in trouble.
 Above all, shun the snares of women,  for they are ever set for the foolish feet of the young.
 Kneel down, my  child, and take an old man's blessing.
"    Alleyne Edricson bent his head while the Abbot poured out his heartfelt  supplication that Heaven would watch over this young soul, now going  forth into the darkness and danger of the world.
 It was no mere form for  either of them.
 To them the outside life of mankind did indeed seem to  be one of violence and of sin, beset with physical and still more with  spiritual danger.
 Heaven, too, was very near to them in those days.
  God's direct agency was to be seen in the thunder and the rainbow,  the whirlwind and the lightning.
 To the believer, clouds of angels and  confessors, and martyrs, armies of the sainted and the saved, were  ever stooping over their struggling brethren upon earth, raising,  encouraging, and supporting them.
 It was then with a lighter heart and  a stouter courage that the young man turned from the Abbot's room, while  the latter, following him to the stair-head, finally commended him to  the protection of the holy Julian, patron of travellers.
    Underneath, in the porch of the Abbey, the monks had gathered to give  him a last God-speed.
 Many had brought some parting token by which he  should remember them.
 There was brother Bartholomew with a crucifix of  rare carved ivory, and brother Luke with a white-backed psalter  adorned with golden bees, and brother Francis with the "Slaying of the  Innocents" most daintily set forth upon vellum.
 All these were  duly packed away deep in the traveller's scrip, and above them old  pippin-faced brother Athanasius had placed a parcel of simnel bread and  rammel cheese, with a small flask of the famous blue-sealed Abbey wine.
  So, amid hand-shakings and laughings and blessings, Alleyne Edricson  turned his back upon Beaulieu.
    At the turn of the road he stopped and gazed back.
 There was the  wide-spread building which he knew so well, the Abbot's house, the long  church, the cloisters with their line of arches, all bathed and mellowed  in the evening sun.
 There too was the broad sweep of the river Exe, the  old stone well, the canopied niche of the Virgin, and in the centre of  all the cluster of white-robed figures who waved their hands to him.
 A  sudden mist swam up before the young man's eyes, and he turned away upon  his journey with a heavy heart and a choking throat.
        .
 HOW HORDLE JOHN COZENED THE FULLER OF LYMINGTON.
      It is not, however, in the nature of things that a lad of twenty, with  young life glowing in his veins and all the wide world before him,  should spend his first hours of freedom in mourning for what he had  left.
 Long ere Alleyne was out of sound of the Beaulieu bells he was  striding sturdily along, swinging his staff and whistling as merrily as  the birds in the thicket.
 It was an evening to raise a man's heart.
 The  sun shining slantwise through the trees threw delicate traceries across  the road, with bars of golden light between.
 Away in the distance  before and behind, the green boughs, now turning in places to a coppery  redness, shot their broad arches across the track.
 The still summer air  was heavy with the resinous smell of the great forest.
 Here and there a  tawny brook prattled out from among the underwood and lost itself again  in the ferns and brambles upon the further side.
 Save the dull piping of  insects and the sough of the leaves, there was silence everywhere--the  sweet restful silence of nature.
    And yet there was no want of life--the whole wide wood was full of it.
  Now it was a lithe, furtive stoat which shot across the path upon some  fell errand of its own; then it was a wild cat which squatted upon the  outlying branch of an oak and peeped at the traveller with a yellow and  dubious eye.
 Once it was a wild sow which scuttled out of the bracken,  with two young sounders at her heels, and once a lordly red staggard  walked daintily out from among the tree trunks, and looked around  him with the fearless gaze of one who lived under the King's own high  protection.
 Alleyne gave his staff a merry flourish, however, and the  red deer bethought him that the King was far off, so streaked away from  whence he came.
    The youth had now journeyed considerably beyond the furthest domains of  the Abbey.
 He was the more surprised therefore when, on coming round a  turn in the path, he perceived a man clad in the familiar garb of the  order, and seated in a clump of heather by the roadside.
 Alleyne had  known every brother well, but this was a face which was new to him--a  face which was very red and puffed, working this way and that, as  though the man were sore perplexed in his mind.
 Once he shook both hands  furiously in the air, and twice he sprang from his seat and hurried down  the road.
 When he rose, however, Alleyne observed that his robe was much  too long and loose for him in every direction, trailing upon the ground  and bagging about his ankles, so that even with trussed-up skirts he  could make little progress.
 He ran once, but the long gown clogged him  so that he slowed down into a shambling walk, and finally plumped into  the heather once more.
    "Young friend," said he, when Alleyne was abreast of him, "I fear from  thy garb that thou canst know little of the Abbey of Beaulieu.
"    "Then you are in error, friend," the clerk answered, "for I have spent  all my days within its walls.
"    "Hast so indeed?" cried he.
 "Then perhaps canst tell me the name of  a great loathly lump of a brother wi' freckled face an' a hand like a  spade.
 His eyes were black an' his hair was red an' his voice like  the parish bull.
 I trow that there cannot be two alike in the same  cloisters.
"    "That surely can be no other than brother John," said Alleyne.
 "I trust  he has done you no wrong, that you should be so hot against him.
"    "Wrong, quotha?" cried the other, jumping out of the heather.
 "Wrong!  why he hath stolen every plack of clothing off my back, if that be a  wrong, and hath left me here in this sorry frock of white falding, so  that I have shame to go back to my wife, lest she think that I have  donned her old kirtle.
 Harrow and alas that ever I should have met him!"    "But how came this?" asked the young clerk, who could scarce keep from  laughter at the sight of the hot little man so swathed in the great  white cloak.
    "It came in this way," he said, sitting down once more: "I was passing  this way, hoping to reach Lymington ere nightfall when I came on this  red-headed knave seated even where we are sitting now.
 I uncovered and  louted as I passed thinking that he might be a holy man at his orisons,  but he called to me and asked me if I had heard speak of the new  indulgence in favor of the Cistercians.
 'Not I,' I answered.
 'Then the  worse for thy soul!' said he; and with that he broke into a long tale  how that on account of the virtues of the Abbot Berghersh it had been  decreed by the Pope that whoever should wear the habit of a monk of  Beaulieu for as long as he might say the seven psalms of David should be  assured of the kingdom of Heaven.
 When I heard this I prayed him on  my knees that he would give me the use of his gown, which after many  contentions he at last agreed to do, on my paying him three marks  towards the regilding of the image of Laurence the martyr.
 Having  stripped his robe, I had no choice but to let him have the wearing of my  good leathern jerkin and hose, for, as he said, it was chilling to  the blood and unseemly to the eye to stand frockless whilst I made my  orisons.
 He had scarce got them on, and it was a sore labor, seeing that  my inches will scarce match my girth--he had scarce got them on, I say,  and I not yet at the end of the second psalm, when he bade me do honor  to my new dress, and with that set off down the road as fast as feet  would carry him.
 For myself, I could no more run than if I had been sown  in a sack; so here I sit, and here I am like to sit, before I set eyes  upon my clothes again.
"    "Nay, friend, take it not so sadly," said Alleyne, clapping the  disconsolate one upon the shoulder.
 "Canst change thy robe for a jerkin  once more at the Abbey, unless perchance you have a friend near at  hand.
"    "That have I," he answered, "and close; but I care not to go nigh him in  this plight, for his wife hath a gibing tongue, and will spread the  tale until I could not show my face in any market from Fordingbridge  to Southampton.
 But if you, fair sir, out of your kind charity would be  pleased to go a matter of two bow-shots out of your way, you would do me  such a service as I could scarce repay.
"    "With all my heart," said Alleyne readily.
    "Then take this pathway on the left, I pray thee, and then the  deer-track which passes on the right.
 You will then see under a great  beech-tree the hut of a charcoal-burner.
 Give him my name, good sir,  the name of Peter the fuller, of Lymington, and ask him for a change of  raiment, that I may pursue my journey without delay.
 There are reasons  why he would be loth to refuse me.
"    Alleyne started off along the path indicated, and soon found the log-hut  where the burner dwelt.
 He was away faggot-cutting in the forest, but  his wife, a ruddy bustling dame, found the needful garments and tied  them into a bundle.
 While she busied herself in finding and folding  them, Alleyne Edricson stood by the open door looking in at her with  much interest and some distrust, for he had never been so nigh to a  woman before.
 She had round red arms, a dress of some sober woollen  stuff, and a brass brooch the size of a cheese-cake stuck in the front  of it.
    "Peter the fuller!" she kept repeating.
 "Marry come up! if I were Peter  the fuller's wife I would teach him better than to give his clothes to  the first knave who asks for them.
 But he was always a poor, fond, silly  creature, was Peter, though we are beholden to him for helping to bury  our second son Wat, who was a 'prentice to him at Lymington in the year  of the Black Death.
 But who are you, young sir?"    "I am a clerk on my road from Beaulieu to Minstead.
"    "Aye, indeed! Hast been brought up at the Abbey then.
 I could read it  from thy reddened cheek and downcast eye.
 Hast learned from the monks, I  trow, to fear a woman as thou wouldst a lazar-house.
 Out upon them! that  they should dishonor their own mothers by such teaching.
 A pretty world  it would be with all the women out of it.
"    "Heaven forfend that such a thing should come to pass!" said Alleyne.
    "Amen and amen! But thou art a pretty lad, and the prettier for thy  modest ways.
 It is easy to see from thy cheek that thou hast not spent  thy days in the rain and the heat and the wind, as my poor Wat hath been  forced to do.
"    "I have indeed seen little of life, good dame.
"    "Wilt find nothing in it to pay for the loss of thy own freshness.
 Here  are the clothes, and Peter can leave them when next he comes this way.
  Holy Virgin! see the dust upon thy doublet! It were easy to see that  there is no woman to tend to thee.
 So!--that is better.
 Now buss me,  boy.
"    Alleyne stooped and kissed her, for the kiss was the common salutation  of the age, and, as Erasmus long afterwards remarked, more used in  England than in any other country.
 Yet it sent the blood to his temples  again, and he wondered, as he turned away, what the Abbot Berghersh  would have answered to so frank an invitation.
 He was still tingling  from this new experience when he came out upon the high-road and saw a  sight which drove all other thoughts from his mind.
    Some way down from where he had left him the unfortunate Peter was  stamping and raving tenfold worse than before.
 Now, however, instead of  the great white cloak, he had no clothes on at all, save a short woollen  shirt and a pair of leather shoes.
 Far down the road a long-legged  figure was running, with a bundle under one arm and the other hand to  his side, like a man who laughs until he is sore.
    "See him!" yelled Peter.
 "Look to him! You shall be my witness.
 He shall  see Winchester jail for this.
 See where he goes with my cloak under his  arm!"    "Who then?" cried Alleyne.
    "Who but that cursed brother John.
 He hath not left me clothes enough to  make a gallybagger.
 The double thief hath cozened me out of my gown.
"    "Stay though, my friend, it was his gown," objected Alleyne.
    "It boots not.
 He hath them all--gown, jerkin, hosen and all.
 Gramercy  to him that he left me the shirt and the shoon.
 I doubt not that he will  be back for them anon.
"    "But how came this?" asked Alleyne, open-eyed with astonishment.
    "Are those the clothes? For dear charity's sake give them to me.
 Not the  Pope himself shall have these from me, though he sent the whole college  of cardinals to ask it.
 How came it? Why, you had scarce gone ere this  loathly John came running back again, and, when I oped mouth to reproach  him, he asked me whether it was indeed likely that a man of prayer would  leave his own godly raiment in order to take a layman's jerkin.
 He  had, he said, but gone for a while that I might be the freer for my  devotions.
 On this I plucked off the gown, and he with much show of  haste did begin to undo his points; but when I threw his frock down  he clipped it up and ran off all untrussed, leaving me in this sorry  plight.
 He laughed so the while, like a great croaking frog, that I  might have caught him had my breath not been as short as his legs were  long.
"    The young man listened to this tale of wrong with all the seriousness  that he could maintain; but at the sight of the pursy red-faced man and  the dignity with which he bore him, the laughter came so thick upon him  that he had to lean up against a tree-trunk.
 The fuller looked sadly and  gravely at him; but finding that he still laughed, he bowed with much  mock politeness and stalked onwards in his borrowed clothes.
 Alleyne  watched him until he was small in the distance, and then, wiping the  tears from his eyes, he set off briskly once more upon his journey.
        .
 HOW THE BAILIFF OF SOUTHAMPTON SLEW THE TWO MASTERLESS MEN.
      The road along which he travelled was scarce as populous as most other  roads in the kingdom, and far less so than those which lie between the  larger towns.
 Yet from time to time Alleyne met other wayfarers, and  more than once was overtaken by strings of pack mules and horsemen  journeying in the same direction as himself.
 Once a begging friar came  limping along in a brown habit, imploring in a most dolorous voice to  give him a single groat to buy bread wherewith to save himself from  impending death.
 Alleyne passed him swiftly by, for he had learned from  the monks to have no love for the wandering friars, and, besides, there  was a great half-gnawed mutton bone sticking out of his pouch to prove  him a liar.
 Swiftly as he went, however, he could not escape the curse  of the four blessed evangelists which the mendicant howled behind him.
  So dreadful are his execrations that the frightened lad thrust his  fingers into his ear-holes, and ran until the fellow was but a brown  smirch upon the yellow road.
    Further on, at the edge of the woodland, he came upon a chapman and his  wife, who sat upon a fallen tree.
 He had put his pack down as a table,  and the two of them were devouring a great pasty, and washing it down  with some drink from a stone jar.
 The chapman broke a rough jest as he  passed, and the woman called shrilly to Alleyne to come and join them,  on which the man, turning suddenly from mirth to wrath, began to belabor  her with his cudgel.
 Alleyne hastened on, lest he make more mischief,  and his heart was heavy as lead within him.
 Look where he would, he  seemed to see nothing but injustice and violence and the hardness of man  to man.
    But even as he brooded sadly over it and pined for the sweet peace of  the Abbey, he came on an open space dotted with holly bushes, where was  the strangest sight that he had yet chanced upon.
 Near to the pathway  lay a long clump of greenery, and from behind this there stuck straight  up into the air four human legs clad in parti-colored hosen, yellow and  black.
 Strangest of all was when a brisk tune struck suddenly up and  the four legs began to kick and twitter in time to the music.
 Walking on  tiptoe round the bushes, he stood in amazement to see two men bounding  about on their heads, while they played, the one a viol and the other  a pipe, as merrily and as truly as though they were seated in a choir.
  Alleyne crossed himself as he gazed at this unnatural sight, and  could scarce hold his ground with a steady face, when the two dancers,  catching sight of him, came bouncing in his direction.
 A spear's length  from him, they each threw a somersault into the air, and came down upon  their feet with smirking faces and their hands over their hearts.
    "A guerdon--a guerdon, my knight of the staring eyes!" cried one.
    "A gift, my prince!" shouted the other.
 "Any trifle will serve--a purse  of gold, or even a jewelled goblet.
"    Alleyne thought of what he had read of demoniac possession--the  jumpings, the twitchings, the wild talk.
 It was in his mind to repeat  over the exorcism proper to such attacks; but the two burst out  a-laughing at his scared face, and turning on to their heads once more,  clapped their heels in derision.
    "Hast never seen tumblers before?" asked the elder, a black-browed,  swarthy man, as brown and supple as a hazel twig.
 "Why shrink from us,  then, as though we were the spawn of the Evil One?"    "Why shrink, my honey-bird? Why so afeard, my sweet cinnamon?" exclaimed  the other, a loose-jointed lanky youth with a dancing, roguish eye.
    "Truly, sirs, it is a new sight to me," the clerk answered.
 "When I saw  your four legs above the bush I could scarce credit my own eyes.
 Why is  it that you do this thing?"    "A dry question to answer," cried the younger, coming back on to  his feet.
 "A most husky question, my fair bird! But how? A flask, a  flask!--by all that is wonderful!" He shot out his hand as he spoke, and  plucking Alleyne's bottle out of his scrip, he deftly knocked the neck  off, and poured the half of it down his throat.
 The rest he handed to  his comrade, who drank the wine, and then, to the clerk's increasing  amazement, made a show of swallowing the bottle, with such skill  that Alleyne seemed to see it vanish down his throat.
 A moment later,  however, he flung it over his head, and caught it bottom downwards upon  the calf of his left leg.
    "We thank you for the wine, kind sir," said he, "and for the ready  courtesy wherewith you offered it.
 Touching your question, we may tell  you that we are strollers and jugglers, who, having performed with much  applause at Winchester fair, are now on our way to the great Michaelmas  market at Ringwood.
 As our art is a very fine and delicate one, however,  we cannot let a day go by without exercising ourselves in it, to which  end we choose some quiet and sheltered spot where we may break our  journey.
 Here you find us; and we cannot wonder that you, who are new to  tumbling, should be astounded, since many great barons, earls, marshals  and knights, who have wandered as far as the Holy Land, are of one  mind in saying that they have never seen a more noble or gracious  performance.
 If you will be pleased to sit upon that stump, we will now  continue our exercise.
"    Alleyne sat down willingly as directed with two great bundles on  either side of him which contained the strollers' dresses--doublets of  flame-colored silk and girdles of leather, spangled with brass and tin.
  The jugglers were on their heads once more, bounding about with rigid  necks, playing the while in perfect time and tune.
 It chanced that out  of one of the bundles there stuck the end of what the clerk saw to be  a cittern, so drawing it forth, he tuned it up and twanged a harmony to  the merry lilt which the dancers played.
 On that they dropped their own  instruments, and putting their hands to the ground they hopped about  faster and faster, ever shouting to him to play more briskly, until at  last for very weariness all three had to stop.
    "Well played, sweet poppet!" cried the younger.
 "Hast a rare touch on  the strings.
"    "How knew you the tune?" asked the other.
    "I knew it not.
 I did but follow the notes I heard.
"    Both opened their eyes at this, and stared at Alleyne with as much  amazement as he had shown at them.
    "You have a fine trick of ear then," said one.
 "We have long wished to  meet such a man.
 Wilt join us and jog on to Ringwood? Thy duties shall  be light, and thou shalt have two-pence a day and meat for supper every  night.
"    "With as much beer as you can put away," said the other, "and a flask of  Gascon wine on Sabbaths.
"    "Nay, it may not be.
 I have other work to do.
 I have tarried with you  over long," quoth Alleyne, and resolutely set forth upon his journey  once more.
 They ran behind him some little way, offering him first  fourpence and then sixpence a day, but he only smiled and shook his  head, until at last they fell away from him.
 Looking back, he saw that  the smaller had mounted on the younger's shoulders, and that they stood  so, some ten feet high, waving their adieus to him.
 He waved back to  them, and then hastened on, the lighter of heart for having fallen in  with these strange men of pleasure.
    Alleyne had gone no great distance for all the many small passages that  had befallen him.
 Yet to him, used as he was to a life of such quiet  that the failure of a brewing or the altering of an anthem had seemed  to be of the deepest import, the quick changing play of the lights and  shadows of life was strangely startling and interesting.
 A gulf seemed  to divide this brisk uncertain existence from the old steady round of  work and of prayer which he had left behind him.
 The few hours that had  passed since he saw the Abbey tower stretched out in his memory until  they outgrew whole months of the stagnant life of the cloister.
 As he  walked and munched the soft bread from his scrip, it seemed strange to  him to feel that it was still warm from the ovens of Beaulieu.
    When he passed Penerley, where were three cottages and a barn, he  reached the edge of the tree country, and found the great barren heath  of Blackdown stretching in front of him, all pink with heather and  bronzed with the fading ferns.
 On the left the woods were still thick,  but the road edged away from them and wound over the open.
 The sun lay  low in the west upon a purple cloud, whence it threw a mild, chastening  light over the wild moorland and glittered on the fringe of forest  turning the withered leaves into flakes of dead gold, the brighter for  the black depths behind them.
 To the seeing eye decay is as fair as  growth, and death as life.
 The thought stole into Alleyne's heart as he  looked upon the autumnal country side and marvelled at its beauty.
 He  had little time to dwell upon it however, for there were still six good  miles between him and the nearest inn.
 He sat down by the roadside  to partake of his bread and cheese, and then with a lighter scrip he  hastened upon his way.
    There appeared to be more wayfarers on the down than in the forest.
  First he passed two Dominicans in their long black dresses, who swept by  him with downcast looks and pattering lips, without so much as a glance  at him.
 Then there came a gray friar, or minorite, with a good paunch  upon him, walking slowly and looking about him with the air of a man who  was at peace with himself and with all men.
 He stopped Alleyne to ask  him whether it was not true that there was a hostel somewhere in those  parts which was especially famous for the stewing of eels.
 The clerk  having made answer that he had heard the eels of Sowley well spoken of,  the friar sucked in his lips and hurried forward.
 Close at his heels  came three laborers walking abreast, with spade and mattock over their  shoulders.
 They sang some rude chorus right tunefully as they walked,  but their English was so coarse and rough that to the ears of a  cloister-bred man it sounded like a foreign and barbarous tongue.
 One  of them carried a young bittern which they had caught upon the moor, and  they offered it to Alleyne for a silver groat.
 Very glad he was to get  safely past them, for, with their bristling red beards and their fierce  blue eyes, they were uneasy men to bargain with upon a lonely moor.
    Yet it is not always the burliest and the wildest who are the most to  be dreaded.
 The workers looked hungrily at him, and then jogged onwards  upon their way in slow, lumbering Saxon style.
 A worse man to deal with  was a wooden-legged cripple who came hobbling down the path, so weak and  so old to all appearance that a child need not stand in fear of him.
  Yet when Alleyne had passed him, of a sudden, out of pure devilment, he  screamed out a curse at him, and sent a jagged flint stone hurtling past  his ear.
 So horrid was the causeless rage of the crooked creature, that  the clerk came over a cold thrill, and took to his heels until he was  out of shot from stone or word.
 It seemed to him that in this country  of England there was no protection for a man save that which lay in the  strength of his own arm and the speed of his own foot.
 In the cloisters  he had heard vague talk of the law--the mighty law which was higher than  prelate or baron, yet no sign could he see of it.
 What was the benefit  of a law written fair upon parchment, he wondered, if there were no  officers to enforce it.
 As it fell out, however, he had that very  evening, ere the sun had set, a chance of seeing how stern was the grip  of the English law when it did happen to seize the offender.
    A mile or so out upon the moor the road takes a very sudden dip into a  hollow, with a peat-colored stream running swiftly down the centre  of it.
 To the right of this stood, and stands to this day, an ancient  barrow, or burying mound, covered deeply in a bristle of heather and  bracken.
 Alleyne was plodding down the slope upon one side, when he saw  an old dame coming towards him upon the other, limping with weariness  and leaning heavily upon a stick.
 When she reached the edge of the  stream she stood helpless, looking to right and to left for some ford.
  Where the path ran down a great stone had been fixed in the centre of  the brook, but it was too far from the bank for her aged and uncertain  feet.
 Twice she thrust forward at it, and twice she drew back, until at  last, giving up in despair, she sat herself down by the brink and  wrung her hands wearily.
 There she still sat when Alleyne reached the  crossing.
    "Come, mother," quoth he, "it is not so very perilous a passage.
"    "Alas! good youth," she answered, "I have a humor in the eyes, and  though I can see that there is a stone there I can by no means be sure  as to where it lies.
"    "That is easily amended," said he cheerily, and picking her lightly up,  for she was much worn with time, he passed across with her.
 He could  not but observe, however, that as he placed her down her knees seemed to  fail her, and she could scarcely prop herself up with her staff.
    "You are weak, mother," said he.
 "Hast journeyed far, I wot.
"    "From Wiltshire, friend," said she, in a quavering voice; "three days  have I been on the road.
 I go to my son, who is one of the King's  regarders at Brockenhurst.
 He has ever said that he would care for me in  mine old age.
"    "And rightly too, mother, since you cared for him in his youth.
 But when  have you broken fast?"    "At Lyndenhurst; but alas! my money is at an end, and I could but get a  dish of bran-porridge from the nunnery.
 Yet I trust that I may be able  to reach Brockenhurst to-night, where I may have all that heart can  desire; for oh! sir, but my son is a fine man, with a kindly heart of  his own, and it is as good as food to me to think that he should have a  doublet of Lincoln green to his back and be the King's own paid man.
"    "It is a long road yet to Brockenhurst," said Alleyne; "but here is such  bread and cheese as I have left, and here, too, is a penny which may  help you to supper.
 May God be with you!"    "May God be with you, young man!" she cried.
 "May He make your heart as  glad as you have made mine!" She turned away, still mumbling blessings,  and Alleyne saw her short figure and her long shadow stumbling slowly up  the slope.
    He was moving away himself, when his eyes lit upon a strange sight, and  one which sent a tingling through his skin.
 Out of the tangled scrub on  the old overgrown barrow two human faces were looking out at him; the  sinking sun glimmered full upon them, showing up every line and feature.
  The one was an oldish man with a thin beard, a crooked nose, and a broad  red smudge from a birth-mark over his temple; the other was a negro, a  thing rarely met in England at that day, and rarer still in the quiet  southland parts.
 Alleyne had read of such folk, but had never seen one  before, and could scarce take his eyes from the fellow's broad pouting  lip and shining teeth.
 Even as he gazed, however, the two came writhing  out from among the heather, and came down towards him with such a  guilty, slinking carriage, that the clerk felt that there was no good in  them, and hastened onwards upon his way.
    He had not gained the crown of the slope, when he heard a sudden scuffle  behind him and a feeble voice bleating for help.
 Looking round, there  was the old dame down upon the roadway, with her red whimple flying on  the breeze, while the two rogues, black and white, stooped over her,  wresting away from her the penny and such other poor trifles as were  worth the taking.
 At the sight of her thin limbs struggling in weak  resistance, such a glow of fierce anger passed over Alleyne as set his  head in a whirl.
 Dropping his scrip, he bounded over the stream once  more, and made for the two villains, with his staff whirled over his  shoulder and his gray eyes blazing with fury.
    The robbers, however, were not disposed to leave their victim until they  had worked their wicked will upon her.
 The black man, with the woman's  crimson scarf tied round his swarthy head, stood forward in the centre  of the path, with a long dull-colored knife in his hand, while the  other, waving a ragged cudgel, cursed at Alleyne and dared him to  come on.
 His blood was fairly aflame, however, and he needed no such  challenge.
 Dashing at the black man, he smote at him with such good will  that the other let his knife tinkle into the roadway, and hopped howling  to a safer distance.
 The second rogue, however, made of sterner stuff,  rushed in upon the clerk, and clipped him round the waist with a grip  like a bear, shouting the while to his comrade to come round and stab  him in the back.
 At this the negro took heart of grace, and picking up  his dagger again he came stealing with prowling step and murderous eye,  while the two swayed backwards and forwards, staggering this way and  that.
 In the very midst of the scuffle, however, whilst Alleyne braced  himself to feel the cold blade between his shoulders, there came a  sudden scurry of hoofs, and the black man yelled with terror and ran  for his life through the heather.
 The man with the birth-mark, too,  struggled to break away, and Alleyne heard his teeth chatter and felt  his limbs grow limp to his hand.
 At this sign of coming aid the clerk  held on the tighter, and at last was able to pin his man down and  glanced behind him to see where all the noise was coming from.
    Down the slanting road there was riding a big, burly man, clad in a  tunic of purple velvet and driving a great black horse as hard as  it could gallop.
 He leaned well over its neck as he rode, and made a  heaving with his shoulders at every bound as though he were lifting the  steed instead of it carrying him.
 In the rapid glance Alleyne saw that  he had white doeskin gloves, a curling white feather in his flat velvet  cap, and a broad gold, embroidered baldric across his bosom.
 Behind him  rode six others, two and two, clad in sober brown jerkins, with the  long yellow staves of their bows thrusting out from behind their right  shoulders.
 Down the hill they thundered, over the brook and up to the  scene of the contest.
    "Here is one!" said the leader, springing down from his reeking horse,  and seizing the white rogue by the edge of his jerkin.
 "This is one of  them.
 I know him by that devil's touch upon his brow.
 Where are your  cords, Peterkin? So! Bind him hand and foot.
 His last hour has come.
 And  you, young man, who may you be?"    "I am a clerk, sir, travelling from Beaulieu.
"    "A clerk!" cried the other.
 "Art from Oxenford or from Cambridge? Hast  thou a letter from the chancellor of thy college giving thee a permit  to beg? Let me see thy letter.
" He had a stern, square face, with bushy  side whiskers and a very questioning eye.
    "I am from Beaulieu Abbey, and I have no need to beg," said Alleyne, who  was all of a tremble now that the ruffle was over.
    "The better for thee," the other answered.
 "Dost know who I am?"    "No, sir, I do not.
"    "I am the law!"--nodding his head solemnly.
 "I am the law of England  and the mouthpiece of his most gracious and royal majesty, Edward the  Third.
"    Alleyne louted low to the King's representative.
 "Truly you came in good  time, honored sir," said he.
 "A moment later and they would have slain  me.
"    "But there should be another one," cried the man in the purple coat.
  "There should be a black man.
 A shipman with St.
 Anthony's fire, and a  black man who had served him as cook--those are the pair that we are in  chase of.
"    "The black man fled over to that side," said Alleyne, pointing towards  the barrow.
    "He could not have gone far, sir bailiff," cried one of the archers,  unslinging his bow.
 "He is in hiding somewhere, for he knew well, black  paynim as he is, that our horses' four legs could outstrip his two.
"    "Then we shall have him," said the other.
 "It shall never be said,  whilst I am bailiff of Southampton, that any waster, riever, draw-latch  or murtherer came scathless away from me and my posse.
 Leave that rogue  lying.
 Now stretch out in line, my merry ones, with arrow on string, and  I shall show you such sport as only the King can give.
 You on the left,  Howett, and Thomas of Redbridge upon the right.
 So! Beat high and low  among the heather, and a pot of wine to the lucky marksman.
"    As it chanced, however, the searchers had not far to seek.
 The negro had  burrowed down into his hiding-place upon the barrow, where he might have  lain snug enough, had it not been for the red gear upon his head.
 As  he raised himself to look over the bracken at his enemies, the staring  color caught the eye of the bailiff, who broke into a long screeching  whoop and spurred forward sword in hand.
 Seeing himself discovered,  the man rushed out from his hiding-place, and bounded at the top of  his speed down the line of archers, keeping a good hundred paces to the  front of them.
 The two who were on either side of Alleyne bent their  bows as calmly as though they were shooting at the popinjay at the  village fair.
    "Seven yards windage, Hal," said one, whose hair was streaked with gray.
    "Five," replied the other, letting loose his string.
 Alleyne gave a gulp  in his throat, for the yellow streak seemed to pass through the man; but  he still ran forward.
    "Seven, you jack-fool," growled the first speaker, and his bow twanged  like a harp-string.
 The black man sprang high up into the air, and  shot out both his arms and his legs, coming down all a-sprawl among  the heather.
 "Right under the blade bone!" quoth the archer, sauntering  forward for his arrow.
    "The old hound is the best when all is said," quoth the bailiff of  Southampton, as they made back for the roadway.
 "That means a quart of  the best malmsey in Southampton this very night, Matthew Atwood.
 Art  sure that he is dead?"    "Dead as Pontius Pilate, worshipful sir.
"    "It is well.
 Now, as to the other knave.
 There are trees and to spare  over yonder, but we have scarce leisure to make for them.
 Draw thy  sword, Thomas of Redbridge, and hew me his head from his shoulders.
"    "A boon, gracious sir, a boon!" cried the condemned man.
    "What then?" asked the bailiff.
    "I will confess to my crime.
 It was indeed I and the black cook, both  from the ship 'La Rose de Gloire,' of Southampton, who did set upon the  Flanders merchant and rob him of his spicery and his mercery, for which,  as we well know, you hold a warrant against us.
"    "There is little merit in this confession," quoth the bailiff sternly.
  "Thou hast done evil within my bailiwick, and must die.
"    "But, sir," urged Alleyne, who was white to the lips at these bloody  doings, "he hath not yet come to trial.
"    "Young clerk," said the bailiff, "you speak of that of which you know  nothing.
 It is true that he hath not come to trial, but the trial hath  come to him.
 He hath fled the law and is beyond its pale.
 Touch not that  which is no concern of thine.
 But what is this boon, rogue, which you  would crave?"    "I have in my shoe, most worshipful sir, a strip of wood which belonged  once to the bark wherein the blessed Paul was dashed up against the  island of Melita.
 I bought it for two rose nobles from a shipman who  came from the Levant.
 The boon I crave is that you will place it in my  hands and let me die still grasping it.
 In this manner, not only shall  my own eternal salvation be secured, but thine also, for I shall never  cease to intercede for thee.
"    At the command of the bailiff they plucked off the fellow's shoe, and  there sure enough at the side of the instep, wrapped in a piece of fine  sendall, lay a long, dark splinter of wood.
 The archers doffed caps at  the sight of it, and the bailiff crossed himself devoutly as he handed  it to the robber.
    "If it should chance," he said, "that through the surpassing merits of  the blessed Paul your sin-stained soul should gain a way into paradise,  I trust that you will not forget that intercession which you have  promised.
 Bear in mind too, that it is Herward the bailiff for whom you  pray, and not Herward the sheriff, who is my uncle's son.
 Now, Thomas, I  pray you dispatch, for we have a long ride before us and sun has already  set.
"    Alleyne gazed upon the scene--the portly velvet-clad official, the knot  of hard-faced archers with their hands to the bridles of their horses,  the thief with his arms trussed back and his doublet turned down upon  his shoulders.
 By the side of the track the old dame was standing,  fastening her red whimple once more round her head.
 Even as he looked  one of the archers drew his sword with a sharp whirr of steel and stept  up to the lost man.
 The clerk hurried away in horror; but, ere he  had gone many paces, he heard a sudden, sullen thump, with a choking,  whistling sound at the end of it.
 A minute later the bailiff and four  of his men rode past him on their journey back to Southampton, the other  two having been chosen as grave-diggers.
 As they passed Alleyne saw that  one of the men was wiping his sword-blade upon the mane of his horse.
  A deadly sickness came over him at the sight, and sitting down by the  wayside he burst out weeping, with his nerves all in a jangle.
 It was a  terrible world thought he, and it was hard to know which were the most  to be dreaded, the knaves or the men of the law.
        .
 HOW A STRANGE COMPANY GATHERED AT THE "PIED MERLIN.
"      The night had already fallen, and the moon was shining between the rifts  of ragged, drifting clouds, before Alleyne Edricson, footsore and weary  from the unwonted exercise, found himself in front of the forest inn  which stood upon the outskirts of Lyndhurst.
 The building was long and  low, standing back a little from the road, with two flambeaux blazing on  either side of the door as a welcome to the traveller.
 From one window  there thrust forth a long pole with a bunch of greenery tied to the end  of it--a sign that liquor was to be sold within.
 As Alleyne walked up to  it he perceived that it was rudely fashioned out of beams of wood, with  twinkling lights all over where the glow from within shone through the  chinks.
 The roof was poor and thatched; but in strange contrast to  it there ran all along under the eaves a line of wooden shields, most  gorgeously painted with chevron, bend, and saltire, and every heraldic  device.
 By the door a horse stood tethered, the ruddy glow beating  strongly upon his brown head and patient eyes, while his body stood back  in the shadow.
    Alleyne stood still in the roadway for a few minutes reflecting  upon what he should do.
 It was, he knew, only a few miles further to  Minstead, where his brother dwelt.
 On the other hand, he had never seen  this brother since childhood, and the reports which had come to his ears  concerning him were seldom to his advantage.
 By all accounts he was a  hard and a bitter man.
    It might be an evil start to come to his door so late and claim the  shelter of his roof.
 Better to sleep here at this inn, and then travel  on to Minstead in the morning.
 If his brother would take him in, well  and good.
    He would bide with him for a time and do what he might to serve him.
  If, on the other hand, he should have hardened his heart against him,  he could only go on his way and do the best he might by his skill as  a craftsman and a scrivener.
 At the end of a year he would be free  to return to the cloisters, for such had been his father's bequest.
 A  monkish upbringing, one year in the world after the age of twenty, and  then a free selection one way or the other--it was a strange course  which had been marked out for him.
 Such as it was, however, he had no  choice but to follow it, and if he were to begin by making a friend  of his brother he had best wait until morning before he knocked at his  dwelling.
    The rude plank door was ajar, but as Alleyne approached it there came  from within such a gust of rough laughter and clatter of tongues that  he stood irresolute upon the threshold.
 Summoning courage, however, and  reflecting that it was a public dwelling, in which he had as much right  as any other man, he pushed it open and stepped into the common room.
    Though it was an autumn evening and somewhat warm, a huge fire of heaped  billets of wood crackled and sparkled in a broad, open grate, some of  the smoke escaping up a rude chimney, but the greater part rolling out  into the room, so that the air was thick with it, and a man coming from  without could scarce catch his breath.
 On this fire a great cauldron  bubbled and simmered, giving forth a rich and promising smell.
 Seated  round it were a dozen or so folk, of all ages and conditions, who set  up such a shout as Alleyne entered that he stood peering at them through  the smoke, uncertain what this riotous greeting might portend.
    "A rouse! A rouse!" cried one rough looking fellow in a tattered jerkin.
  "One more round of mead or ale and the score to the last comer.
"    "'Tis the law of the 'Pied Merlin,'" shouted another.
 "Ho there, Dame  Eliza! Here is fresh custom come to the house, and not a drain for the  company.
"    "I will take your orders, gentles; I will assuredly take your orders,"  the landlady answered, bustling in with her hands full of leathern  drinking-cups.
 "What is it that you drink, then? Beer for the lads of  the forest, mead for the gleeman, strong waters for the tinker, and wine  for the rest.
 It is an old custom of the house, young sir.
 It has been  the use at the 'Pied Merlin' this many a year back that the company  should drink to the health of the last comer.
 Is it your pleasure to  humor it?"    "Why, good dame," said Alleyne, "I would not offend the customs of your  house, but it is only sooth when I say that my purse is a thin one.
 As  far as two pence will go, however, I shall be right glad to do my part.
"    "Plainly said and bravely spoken, my suckling friar," roared a deep  voice, and a heavy hand fell upon Alleyne's shoulder.
 Looking up, he saw  beside him his former cloister companion the renegade monk, Hordle John.
    "By the thorn of Glastonbury! ill days are coming upon Beaulieu," said  he.
 "Here they have got rid in one day of the only two men within their  walls--for I have had mine eyes upon thee, youngster, and I know that  for all thy baby-face there is the making of a man in thee.
 Then there  is the Abbot, too.
 I am no friend of his, nor he of mine; but he has  warm blood in his veins.
 He is the only man left among them.
 The others,  what are they?"    "They are holy men," Alleyne answered gravely.
    "Holy men? Holy cabbages! Holy bean-pods! What do they do but live and  suck in sustenance and grow fat? If that be holiness, I could show you  hogs in this forest who are fit to head the calendar.
 Think you it was  for such a life that this good arm was fixed upon my shoulder, or that  head placed upon your neck? There is work in the world, man, and it is  not by hiding behind stone walls that we shall do it.
"    "Why, then, did you join the brothers?" asked Alleyne.
    "A fair enough question; but it is as fairly answered.
 I joined them  because Margery Alspaye, of Bolder, married Crooked Thomas of Ringwood,  and left a certain John of Hordle in the cold, for that he was a  ranting, roving blade who was not to be trusted in wedlock.
 That was  why, being fond and hot-headed, I left the world; and that is why,  having had time to take thought, I am right glad to find myself back in  it once more.
 Ill betide the day that ever I took off my yeoman's jerkin  to put on the white gown!"    Whilst he was speaking the landlady came in again, bearing a broad  platter, upon which stood all the beakers and flagons charged to the  brim with the brown ale or the ruby wine.
 Behind her came a maid with  a high pile of wooden plates, and a great sheaf of spoons, one of which  she handed round to each of the travellers.
 Two of the company, who were  dressed in the weather-stained green doublet of foresters, lifted the  big pot off the fire, and a third, with a huge pewter ladle, served out  a portion of steaming collops to each guest.
 Alleyne bore his share and  his ale-mug away with him to a retired trestle in the corner, where he  could sup in peace and watch the strange scene, which was so different  to those silent and well-ordered meals to which he was accustomed.
    The room was not unlike a stable.
 The low ceiling, smoke-blackened and  dingy, was pierced by several square trap-doors with rough-hewn ladders  leading up to them.
 The walls of bare unpainted planks were studded  here and there with great wooden pins, placed at irregular intervals  and heights, from which hung over-tunics, wallets, whips, bridles, and  saddles.
 Over the fireplace were suspended six or seven shields of  wood, with coats-of-arms rudely daubed upon them, which showed by their  varying degrees of smokiness and dirt that they had been placed there  at different periods.
 There was no furniture, save a single long  dresser covered with coarse crockery, and a number of wooden benches and  trestles, the legs of which sank deeply into the soft clay floor, while  the only light, save that of the fire, was furnished by three torches  stuck in sockets on the wall, which flickered and crackled, giving  forth a strong resinous odor.
 All this was novel and strange to the  cloister-bred youth; but most interesting of all was the motley circle  of guests who sat eating their collops round the blaze.
 They were a  humble group of wayfarers, such as might have been found that night  in any inn through the length and breadth of England; but to him they  represented that vague world against which he had been so frequently and  so earnestly warned.
 It did not seem to him from what he could see of it  to be such a very wicked place after all.
    Three or four of the men round the fire were evidently underkeepers  and verderers from the forest, sunburned and bearded, with the quick  restless eye and lithe movements of the deer among which they lived.
  Close to the corner of the chimney sat a middle-aged gleeman, clad in a  faded garb of Norwich cloth, the tunic of which was so outgrown that it  did not fasten at the neck and at the waist.
 His face was swollen and  coarse, and his watery protruding eyes spoke of a life which never  wandered very far from the wine-pot.
 A gilt harp, blotched with many  stains and with two of its strings missing, was tucked under one of his  arms, while with the other he scooped greedily at his platter.
 Next to  him sat two other men of about the same age, one with a trimming of fur  to his coat, which gave him a dignity which was evidently dearer to him  than his comfort, for he still drew it round him in spite of the hot  glare of the faggots.
 The other, clad in a dirty russet suit with a long  sweeping doublet, had a cunning, foxy face with keen, twinkling eyes and  a peaky beard.
 Next to him sat Hordle John, and beside him three other  rough unkempt fellows with tangled beards and matted hair--free laborers  from the adjoining farms, where small patches of freehold property  had been suffered to remain scattered about in the heart of the royal  demesne.
 The company was completed by a peasant in a rude dress of  undyed sheepskin, with the old-fashioned galligaskins about his legs,  and a gayly dressed young man with striped cloak jagged at the edges  and parti-colored hosen, who looked about him with high disdain upon his  face, and held a blue smelling-flask to his nose with one hand, while he  brandished a busy spoon with the other.
 In the corner a very fat man was  lying all a-sprawl upon a truss, snoring stertorously, and evidently in  the last stage of drunkenness.
    "That is Wat the limner," quoth the landlady, sitting down beside  Alleyne, and pointing with the ladle to the sleeping man.
 "That is he  who paints the signs and the tokens.
 Alack and alas that ever I should  have been fool enough to trust him! Now, young man, what manner of a  bird would you suppose a pied merlin to be--that being the proper sign  of my hostel?"    "Why," said Alleyne, "a merlin is a bird of the same form as an eagle or  a falcon.
 I can well remember that learned brother Bartholomew, who is  deep in all the secrets of nature, pointed one out to me as we walked  together near Vinney Ridge.
"    "A falcon or an eagle, quotha? And pied, that is of two several colors.
  So any man would say except this barrel of lies.
 He came to me, look  you, saying that if I would furnish him with a gallon of ale, wherewith  to strengthen himself as he worked, and also the pigments and a board,  he would paint for me a noble pied merlin which I might hang along with  the blazonry over my door.
 I, poor simple fool, gave him the ale and all  that he craved, leaving him alone too, because he said that a man's mind  must be left untroubled when he had great work to do.
 When I came back  the gallon jar was empty, and he lay as you see him, with the board in  front of him with this sorry device.
" She raised up a panel which was  leaning against the wall, and showed a rude painting of a scraggy and  angular fowl, with very long legs and a spotted body.
    "Was that," she asked, "like the bird which thou hast seen?"    Alleyne shook his head, smiling.
    "No, nor any other bird that ever wagged a feather.
 It is most like a  plucked pullet which has died of the spotted fever.
 And scarlet too!  What would the gentles Sir Nicholas Boarhunte, or Sir Bernard Brocas, of  Roche Court, say if they saw such a thing--or, perhaps, even the King's  own Majesty himself, who often has ridden past this way, and who loves  his falcons as he loves his sons? It would be the downfall of my house.
"    "The matter is not past mending," said Alleyne.
 "I pray you, good dame,  to give me those three pigment-pots and the brush, and I shall try  whether I cannot better this painting.
"    Dame Eliza looked doubtfully at him, as though fearing some other  stratagem, but, as he made no demand for ale, she finally brought the  paints, and watched him as he smeared on his background, talking the  while about the folk round the fire.
    "The four forest lads must be jogging soon," she said.
 "They bide at  Emery Down, a mile or more from here.
 Yeomen prickers they are, who tend  to the King's hunt.
 The gleeman is called Floyting Will.
 He comes from  the north country, but for many years he hath gone the round of the  forest from Southampton to Christchurch.
 He drinks much and pays little  but it would make your ribs crackle to hear him sing the 'Jest of Hendy  Tobias.
' Mayhap he will sing it when the ale has warmed him.
"    "Who are those next to him?" asked Alleyne, much interested.
 "He of the  fur mantle has a wise and reverent face.
"    "He is a seller of pills and salves, very learned in humors, and rheums,  and fluxes, and all manner of ailments.
 He wears, as you perceive, the  vernicle of Sainted Luke, the first physician, upon his sleeve.
 May good  St.
 Thomas of Kent grant that it may be long before either I or mine  need his help! He is here to-night for herbergage, as are the others  except the foresters.
 His neighbor is a tooth-drawer.
 That bag at his  girdle is full of the teeth that he drew at Winchester fair.
 I warrant  that there are more sound ones than sorry, for he is quick at his work  and a trifle dim in the eye.
 The lusty man next him with the red head  I have not seen before.
 The four on this side are all workers, three  of them in the service of the bailiff of Sir Baldwin Redvers, and the  other, he with the sheepskin, is, as I hear, a villein from the midlands  who hath run from his master.
 His year and day are well-nigh up, when he  will be a free man.
"    "And the other?" asked Alleyne in a whisper.
 "He is surely some very  great man, for he looks as though he scorned those who were about him.
"    The landlady looked at him in a motherly way and shook her head.
 "You  have had no great truck with the world," she said, "or you would have  learned that it is the small men and not the great who hold their noses  in the air.
 Look at those shields upon my wall and under my eaves.
 Each  of them is the device of some noble lord or gallant knight who hath  slept under my roof at one time or another.
 Yet milder men or easier to  please I have never seen: eating my bacon and drinking my wine with a  merry face, and paying my score with some courteous word or jest which  was dearer to me than my profit.
 Those are the true gentles.
 But your  chapman or your bearward will swear that there is a lime in the wine,  and water in the ale, and fling off at the last with a curse instead of  a blessing.
 This youth is a scholar from Cambrig, where men are wont to  be blown out by a little knowledge, and lose the use of their hands in  learning the laws of the Romans.
 But I must away to lay down the beds.
  So may the saints keep you and prosper you in your undertaking!"    Thus left to himself, Alleyne drew his panel of wood where the light of  one of the torches would strike full upon it, and worked away with all  the pleasure of the trained craftsman, listening the while to the talk  which went on round the fire.
 The peasant in the sheepskins, who had  sat glum and silent all evening, had been so heated by his flagon of ale  that he was talking loudly and angrily with clenched hands and flashing  eyes.
    "Sir Humphrey Tennant of Ashby may till his own fields for me," he  cried.
 "The castle has thrown its shadow upon the cottage over long.
  For three hundred years my folk have swinked and sweated, day in and day  out, to keep the wine on the lord's table and the harness on the lord's  back.
 Let him take off his plates and delve himself, if delving must be  done.
"    "A proper spirit, my fair son!" said one of the free laborers.
 "I would  that all men were of thy way of thinking.
"    "He would have sold me with his acres," the other cried, in a  voice which was hoarse with passion.
 "'The man, the woman and their  litter'--so ran the words of the dotard bailiff.
 Never a bullock on the  farm was sold more lightly.
 Ha! he may wake some black night to find  the flames licking about his ears--for fire is a good friend to the  poor man, and I have seen a smoking heap of ashes where over night there  stood just such another castlewick as Ashby.
"    "This is a lad of mettle!" shouted another of the laborers.
 "He dares to  give tongue to what all men think.
 Are we not all from Adam's loins, all  with flesh and blood, and with the same mouth that must needs have food  and drink? Where all this difference then between the ermine cloak and  the leathern tunic, if what they cover is the same?"    "Aye, Jenkin," said another, "our foeman is under the stole and the  vestment as much as under the helmet and plate of proof.
 We have as much  to fear from the tonsure as from the hauberk.
 Strike at the noble and  the priest shrieks, strike at priest and the noble lays his hand upon  glaive.
 They are twin thieves who live upon our labor.
"    "It would take a clever man to live upon thy labor, Hugh," remarked one  of the foresters, "seeing that the half of thy time is spent in swilling  mead at the 'Pied Merlin.
'"    "Better that than stealing the deer that thou art placed to guard, like  some folk I know.
"    "If you dare open that swine's mouth against me," shouted the woodman,  "I'll crop your ears for you before the hangman has the doing of it,  thou long-jawed lackbrain.
"    "Nay, gentles, gentles!" cried Dame Eliza, in a singsong heedless voice,  which showed that such bickerings were nightly things among her guests.
  "No brawling or brabbling, gentles! Take heed to the good name of the  house.
"    "Besides, if it comes to the cropping of ears, there are other folk who  may say their say," quoth the third laborer.
 "We are all freemen, and  I trow that a yeoman's cudgel is as good as a forester's knife.
 By  St.
 Anselm! it would be an evil day if we had to bend to our master's  servants as well as to our masters.
"    "No man is my master save the King," the woodman answered.
 "Who is  there, save a false traitor, who would refuse to serve the English  king?"    "I know not about the English king," said the man Jenkin.
 "What sort of  English king is it who cannot lay his tongue to a word of English? You  mind last year when he came down to Malwood, with his inner marshal and  his outer marshal, his justiciar, his seneschal, and his four and twenty  guardsmen.
 One noontide I was by Franklin Swinton's gate, when up he  rides with a yeoman pricker at his heels.
 'Ouvre,' he cried, 'ouvre,' or  some such word, making signs for me to open the gate; and then 'Merci,'  as though he were adrad of me.
 And you talk of an English king?"    "I do not marvel at it," cried the Cambrig scholar, speaking in the high  drawling voice which was common among his class.
 "It is not a tongue  for men of sweet birth and delicate upbringing.
 It is a foul, snorting,  snarling manner of speech.
 For myself, I swear by the learned Polycarp  that I have most ease with Hebrew, and after that perchance with  Arabian.
"    "I will not hear a word said against old King Ned," cried Hordle John  in a voice like a bull.
 "What if he is fond of a bright eye and a saucy  face.
 I know one of his subjects who could match him at that.
 If  he cannot speak like an Englishman I trow that he can fight like an  Englishman, and he was hammering at the gates of Paris while ale-house  topers were grutching and grumbling at home.
"    This loud speech, coming from a man of so formidable an appearance,  somewhat daunted the disloyal party, and they fell into a sullen  silence, which enabled Alleyne to hear something of the talk which was  going on in the further corner between the physician, the tooth-drawer  and the gleeman.
    "A raw rat," the man of drugs was saying, "that is what it is ever my  use to order for the plague--a raw rat with its paunch cut open.
"    "Might it not be broiled, most learned sir?" asked the tooth-drawer.
 "A  raw rat sounds a most sorry and cheerless dish.
"    "Not to be eaten," cried the physician, in high disdain.
 "Why should any  man eat such a thing?"    "Why indeed?" asked the gleeman, taking a long drain at his tankard.
    "It is to be placed on the sore or swelling.
 For the rat, mark you,  being a foul-living creature, hath a natural drawing or affinity for  all foul things, so that the noxious humors pass from the man into the  unclean beast.
"    "Would that cure the black death, master?" asked Jenkin.
    "Aye, truly would it, my fair son.
"    "Then I am right glad that there were none who knew of it.
 The black  death is the best friend that ever the common folk had in England.
"    "How that then?" asked Hordle John.
    "Why, friend, it is easy to see that you have not worked with your hands  or you would not need to ask.
 When half the folk in the country were  dead it was then that the other half could pick and choose who they  would work for, and for what wage.
 That is why I say that the murrain  was the best friend that the borel folk ever had.
"    "True, Jenkin," said another workman; "but it is not all good that is  brought by it either.
 We well know that through it corn-land has been  turned into pasture, so that flocks of sheep with perchance a single  shepherd wander now where once a hundred men had work and wage.
"    "There is no great harm in that," remarked the tooth-drawer, "for the  sheep give many folk their living.
 There is not only the herd, but the  shearer and brander, and then the dresser, the curer, the dyer, the  fuller, the webster, the merchant, and a score of others.
"    "If it come to that.
" said one of the foresters, "the tough meat of them  will wear folks teeth out, and there is a trade for the man who can draw  them.
"    A general laugh followed this sally at the dentist's expense, in the  midst of which the gleeman placed his battered harp upon his knee, and  began to pick out a melody upon the frayed strings.
    "Elbow room for Floyting Will!" cried the woodmen.
 "Twang us a merry  lilt.
"    "Aye, aye, the 'Lasses of Lancaster,'" one suggested.
    "Or 'St.
 Simeon and the Devil.
'"    "Or the 'Jest of Hendy Tobias.
'"    To all these suggestions the jongleur made no response, but sat with his  eye fixed abstractedly upon the ceiling, as one who calls words to his  mind.
 Then, with a sudden sweep across the strings, he broke out into  a song so gross and so foul that ere he had finished a verse the  pure-minded lad sprang to his feet with the blood tingling in his face.
    "How can you sing such things?" he cried.
 "You, too, an old man who  should be an example to others.
"    The wayfarers all gazed in the utmost astonishment at the interruption.
    "By the holy Dicon of Hampole! our silent clerk has found his tongue,"  said one of the woodmen.
 "What is amiss with the song then? How has it  offended your babyship?"    "A milder and better mannered song hath never been heard within these  walls," cried another.
 "What sort of talk is this for a public inn?"    "Shall it be a litany, my good clerk?" shouted a third; "or would a hymn  be good enough to serve?"    The jongleur had put down his harp in high dudgeon.
 "Am I to be preached  to by a child?" he cried, staring across at Alleyne with an inflamed and  angry countenance.
 "Is a hairless infant to raise his tongue against me,  when I have sung in every fair from Tweed to Trent, and have twice been  named aloud by the High Court of the Minstrels at Beverley? I shall sing  no more to-night.
"    "Nay, but you will so," said one of the laborers.
 "Hi, Dame Eliza, bring  a stoup of your best to Will to clear his throat.
 Go forward with thy  song, and if our girl-faced clerk does not love it he can take to the  road and go whence he came.
"    "Nay, but not too last," broke in Hordle John.
 "There are two words in  this matter.
 It may be that my little comrade has been over quick in  reproof, he having gone early into the cloisters and seen little of the  rough ways and words of the world.
 Yet there is truth in what he says,  for, as you know well, the song was not of the cleanest.
 I shall stand  by him, therefore, and he shall neither be put out on the road, nor  shall his ears be offended indoors.
"    "Indeed, your high and mighty grace," sneered one of the yeomen, "have  you in sooth so ordained?"    "By the Virgin!" said a second, "I think that you may both chance to  find yourselves upon the road before long.
"    "And so belabored as to be scarce able to crawl along it," cried a  third.
    "Nay, I shall go! I shall go!" said Alleyne hurriedly, as Hordle John  began to slowly roll up his sleeve, and bare an arm like a leg of  mutton.
 "I would not have you brawl about me.
"    "Hush! lad," he whispered, "I count them not a fly.
 They may find they  have more tow on their distaff than they know how to spin.
 Stand thou  clear and give me space.
"    Both the foresters and the laborers had risen from their bench, and Dame  Eliza and the travelling doctor had flung themselves between the two  parties with soft words and soothing gestures, when the door of the  "Pied Merlin" was flung violently open, and the attention of the company  was drawn from their own quarrel to the new-comer who had burst so  unceremoniously upon them.
        .
 HOW SAMKIN AYLWARD WAGERED HIS FEATHER-BED.
      He was a middle-sized man, of most massive and robust build, with an  arching chest and extraordinary breadth of shoulder.
 His shaven face was  as brown as a hazel-nut, tanned and dried by the weather, with harsh,  well-marked features, which were not improved by a long white scar which  stretched from the corner of his left nostril to the angle of the jaw.
  His eyes were bright and searching, with something of menace and of  authority in their quick glitter, and his mouth was firm-set and hard,  as befitted one who was wont to set his face against danger.
 A straight  sword by his side and a painted long-bow jutting over his shoulder  proclaimed his profession, while his scarred brigandine of chain-mail  and his dinted steel cap showed that he was no holiday soldier, but one  who was even now fresh from the wars.
 A white surcoat with the lion  of St.
 George in red upon the centre covered his broad breast, while a  sprig of new-plucked broom at the side of his head-gear gave a touch of  gayety and grace to his grim, war-worn equipment.
    "Ha!" he cried, blinking like an owl in the sudden glare.
 "Good even  to you, comrades! Hola! a woman, by my soul!" and in an instant he had  clipped Dame Eliza round the waist and was kissing her violently.
 His  eye happening to wander upon the maid, however, he instantly abandoned  the mistress and danced off after the other, who scurried in confusion  up one of the ladders, and dropped the heavy trap-door upon her pursuer.
  He then turned back and saluted the landlady once more with the utmost  relish and satisfaction.
    "La petite is frightened," said he.
 "Ah, c'est l'amour, l'amour! Curse  this trick of French, which will stick to my throat.
 I must wash it out  with some good English ale.
 By my hilt! camarades, there is no drop of  French blood in my body, and I am a true English bowman, Samkin Aylward  by name; and I tell you, mes amis, that it warms my very heart-roots to  set my feet on the dear old land once more.
 When I came off the galley  at Hythe, this very day, I down on my bones, and I kissed the good brown  earth, as I kiss thee now, ma belle, for it was eight long years since  I had seen it.
 The very smell of it seemed life to me.
 But where are my  six rascals? Hola, there! En avant!"    At the order, six men, dressed as common drudges, marched solemnly  into the room, each bearing a huge bundle upon his head.
 They formed in  military line, while the soldier stood in front of them with stern eyes,  checking off their several packages.
    "Number one--a French feather-bed with the two counter-panes of white  sendall," said he.
    "Here, worthy sir," answered the first of the bearers, laying a great  package down in the corner.
    "Number two--seven ells of red Turkey cloth and nine ells of cloth of  gold.
 Put it down by the other.
 Good dame, I prythee give each of these  men a bottrine of wine or a jack of ale.
 Three--a full piece of white  Genoan velvet with twelve ells of purple silk.
 Thou rascal, there is  dirt on the hem! Thou hast brushed it against some wall, coquin!"    "Not I, most worthy sir," cried the carrier, shrinking away from the  fierce eyes of the bowman.
    "I say yes, dog! By the three kings! I have seen a man gasp out his last  breath for less.
 Had you gone through the pain and unease that I have  done to earn these things you would be at more care.
 I swear by my ten  finger-bones that there is not one of them that hath not cost its weight  in French blood! Four--an incense-boat, a ewer of silver, a gold buckle  and a cope worked in pearls.
 I found them, camarades, at the Church of  St.
 Denis in the harrying of Narbonne, and I took them away with me lest  they fall into the hands of the wicked.
 Five--a cloak of fur turned  up with minever, a gold goblet with stand and cover, and a box of  rose-colored sugar.
 See that you lay them together.
 Six--a box of  monies, three pounds of Limousine gold-work, a pair of boots, silver  tagged, and, lastly, a store of naping linen.
 So, the tally is complete!  Here is a groat apiece, and you may go.
"    "Go whither, worthy sir?" asked one of the carriers.
    "Whither? To the devil if ye will.
 What is it to me? Now, ma belle, to  supper.
 A pair of cold capons, a mortress of brawn, or what you will,  with a flask or two of the right Gascony.
 I have crowns in my pouch,  my sweet, and I mean to spend them.
 Bring in wine while the food is  dressing.
 Buvons my brave lads; you shall each empty a stoup with me.
"    Here was an offer which the company in an English inn at that or any  other date are slow to refuse.
 The flagons were re-gathered and came  back with the white foam dripping over their edges.
 Two of the woodmen  and three of the laborers drank their portions off hurriedly and trooped  off together, for their homes were distant and the hour late.
 The  others, however, drew closer, leaving the place of honor to the right  of the gleeman to the free-handed new-comer.
 He had thrown off his steel  cap and his brigandine, and had placed them with his sword, his quiver  and his painted long-bow, on the top of his varied heap of plunder in  the corner.
 Now, with his thick and somewhat bowed legs stretched in  front of the blaze, his green jerkin thrown open, and a great quart  pot held in his corded fist, he looked the picture of comfort and of  good-fellowship.
 His hard-set face had softened, and the thick crop of  crisp brown curls which had been hidden by his helmet grew low upon his  massive neck.
 He might have been forty years of age, though hard toil  and harder pleasure had left their grim marks upon his features.
 Alleyne  had ceased painting his pied merlin, and sat, brush in hand, staring  with open eyes at a type of man so strange and so unlike any whom he had  met.
 Men had been good or had been bad in his catalogue, but here was a  man who was fierce one instant and gentle the next, with a curse on his  lips and a smile in his eye.
 What was to be made of such a man as that?    It chanced that the soldier looked up and saw the questioning glance  which the young clerk threw upon him.
 He raised his flagon and drank to  him, with a merry flash of his white teeth.
    "A toi, mon garcon," he cried.
 "Hast surely never seen a man-at-arms,  that thou shouldst stare so?"    "I never have," said Alleyne frankly, "though I have oft heard talk of  their deeds.
"    "By my hilt!" cried the other, "if you were to cross the narrow sea you  would find them as thick as bees at a tee-hole.
 Couldst not shoot a  bolt down any street of Bordeaux, I warrant, but you would pink archer,  squire, or knight.
 There are more breastplates than gaberdines to be  seen, I promise you.
"    "And where got you all these pretty things?" asked Hordle John, pointing  at the heap in the corner.
    "Where there is as much more waiting for any brave lad to pick it up.
  Where a good man can always earn a good wage, and where he need look  upon no man as his paymaster, but just reach his hand out and help  himself.
 Aye, it is a goodly and a proper life.
 And here I drink to  mine old comrades, and the saints be with them! Arouse all together,  mes enfants, under pain of my displeasure.
 To Sir Claude Latour and the  White Company!"    "Sir Claude Latour and the White Company!" shouted the travellers,  draining off their goblets.
    "Well quaffed, mes braves! It is for me to fill your cups again, since  you have drained them to my dear lads of the white jerkin.
 Hola! mon  ange, bring wine and ale.
 How runs the old stave?--            We'll drink all together          To the gray goose feather          And the land where the gray goose flew.
"    He roared out the catch in a harsh, unmusical voice, and ended with a  shout of laughter.
 "I trust that I am a better bowman than a minstrel,"  said he.
    "Methinks I have some remembrance of the lilt," remarked the gleeman,  running his fingers over the strings.
 "Hoping that it will give thee no  offence, most holy sir"--with a vicious snap at Alleyne--"and with the  kind permit of the company, I will even venture upon it.
"    Many a time in the after days Alleyne Edricson seemed to see that scene,  for all that so many which were stranger and more stirring were soon  to crowd upon him.
 The fat, red-faced gleeman, the listening group, the  archer with upraised finger beating in time to the music, and the huge  sprawling figure of Hordle John, all thrown into red light and black  shadow by the flickering fire in the centre--memory was to come often  lovingly back to it.
 At the time he was lost in admiration at the deft  way in which the jongleur disguised the loss of his two missing strings,  and the lusty, hearty fashion in which he trolled out his little ballad  of the outland bowmen, which ran in some such fashion as this:              What of the bow?              The bow was made in England:          Of true wood, of yew wood,            The wood of English bows;              So men who are free              Love the old yew tree          And the land where the yew tree grows.
              What of the cord?              The cord was made in England:          A rough cord, a tough cord,            A cord that bowmen love;              So we'll drain our jacks              To the English flax          And the land where the hemp was wove.
              What of the shaft?              The shaft was cut in England:          A long shaft, a strong shaft,            Barbed and trim and true;              So we'll drink all together              To the gray goose feather          And the land where the gray goose flew.
              What of the men?              The men were bred in England:          The bowman--the yeoman--            The lads of dale and fell              Here's to you--and to you;              To the hearts that are true          And the land where the true hearts dwell.
    "Well sung, by my hilt!" shouted the archer in high delight.
 "Many a  night have I heard that song, both in the old war-time and after in the  days of the White Company, when Black Simon of Norwich would lead the  stave, and four hundred of the best bowmen that ever drew string would  come roaring in upon the chorus.
 I have seen old John Hawkwood, the same  who has led half the Company into Italy, stand laughing in his beard as  he heard it, until his plates rattled again.
 But to get the full smack  of it ye must yourselves be English bowmen, and be far off upon an  outland soil.
"    Whilst the song had been singing Dame Eliza and the maid had placed a  board across two trestles, and had laid upon it the knife, the spoon,  the salt, the tranchoir of bread, and finally the smoking dish which  held the savory supper.
 The archer settled himself to it like one who  had known what it was to find good food scarce; but his tongue still  went as merrily as his teeth.
    "It passes me," he cried, "how all you lusty fellows can bide scratching  your backs at home when there are such doings over the seas.
 Look at  me--what have I to do? It is but the eye to the cord, the cord to the  shaft, and the shaft to the mark.
 There is the whole song of it.
 It is  but what you do yourselves for pleasure upon a Sunday evening at the  parish village butts.
"    "And the wage?" asked a laborer.
    "You see what the wage brings," he answered.
 "I eat of the best, and I  drink deep.
 I treat my friend, and I ask no friend to treat me.
 I clap  a silk gown on my girl's back.
 Never a knight's lady shall be better  betrimmed and betrinketed.
 How of all that, mon garcon? And how of the  heap of trifles that you can see for yourselves in yonder corner? They  are from the South French, every one, upon whom I have been making  war.
 By my hilt! camarades, I think that I may let my plunder speak for  itself.
"    "It seems indeed to be a goodly service," said the tooth-drawer.
    "Tete bleu! yes, indeed.
 Then there is the chance of a ransom.
 Why, look  you, in the affair at Brignais some four years back, when the companies  slew James of Bourbon, and put his army to the sword, there was scarce a  man of ours who had not count, baron, or knight.
 Peter Karsdale, who  was but a common country lout newly brought over, with the English fleas  still hopping under his doublet, laid his great hands upon the Sieur  Amaury de Chatonville, who owns half Picardy, and had five thousand  crowns out of him, with his horse and harness.
 'Tis true that a French  wench took it all off Peter as quick as the Frenchman paid it; but what  then? By the twang of string! it would be a bad thing if money was not  made to be spent; and how better than on woman--eh, ma belle?"    "It would indeed be a bad thing if we had not our brave archers to bring  wealth and kindly customs into the country," quoth Dame Eliza, on whom  the soldier's free and open ways had made a deep impression.
    "A toi, ma cherie!" said he, with his hand over his heart.
 "Hola! there  is la petite peeping from behind the door.
 A toi, aussi, ma petite! Mon  Dieu! but the lass has a good color!"    "There is one thing, fair sir," said the Cambridge student in his  piping voice, "which I would fain that you would make more clear.
 As  I understand it, there was peace made at the town of Bretigny some six  years back between our most gracious monarch and the King of the French.
  This being so, it seems most passing strange that you should talk so  loudly of war and of companies when there is no quarrel between the  French and us.
"    "Meaning that I lie," said the archer, laying down his knife.
    "May heaven forfend!" cried the student hastily.
 "_Magna est veritas sed  rara_, which means in the Latin tongue that archers are all honorable  men.
 I come to you seeking knowledge, for it is my trade to learn.
"    "I fear that you are yet a 'prentice to that trade," quoth the soldier;  "for there is no child over the water but could answer what you ask.
  Know then that though there may be peace between our own provinces and  the French, yet within the marches of France there is always war, for  the country is much divided against itself, and is furthermore harried  by bands of flayers, skinners, Brabacons, tardvenus, and the rest of  them.
 When every man's grip is on his neighbor's throat, and every  five-sous-piece of a baron is marching with tuck of drum to fight whom  he will, it would be a strange thing if five hundred brave English boys  could not pick up a living.
 Now that Sir John Hawkwood hath gone with  the East Anglian lads and the Nottingham woodmen into the service of the  Marquis of Montferrat to fight against the Lord of Milan, there are but  ten score of us left, yet I trust that I may be able to bring some back  with me to fill the ranks of the White Company.
 By the tooth of Peter!  it would be a bad thing if I could not muster many a Hamptonshire man  who would be ready to strike in under the red flag of St.
 George, and  the more so if Sir Nigel Loring, of Christchurch, should don hauberk  once more and take the lead of us.
"    "Ah, you would indeed be in luck then," quoth a woodman; "for it is said  that, setting aside the prince, and mayhap good old Sir John Chandos,  there was not in the whole army a man of such tried courage.
"    "It is sooth, every word of it," the archer answered.
 "I have seen him  with these two eyes in a stricken field, and never did man carry himself  better.
 Mon Dieu! yes, ye would not credit it to look at him, or to  hearken to his soft voice, but from the sailing from Orwell down to  the foray to Paris, and that is clear twenty years, there was not a  skirmish, onfall, sally, bushment, escalado or battle, but Sir Nigel was  in the heart of it.
 I go now to Christchurch with a letter to him from  Sir Claude Latour to ask him if he will take the place of Sir John  Hawkwood; and there is the more chance that he will if I bring one or  two likely men at my heels.
 What say you, woodman: wilt leave the bucks  to loose a shaft at a nobler mark?"    The forester shook his head.
 "I have wife and child at Emery Down,"  quoth he; "I would not leave them for such a venture.
"    "You, then, young sir?" asked the archer.
    "Nay, I am a man of peace," said Alleyne Edricson.
 "Besides, I have  other work to do.
"    "Peste!" growled the soldier, striking his flagon on the board until the  dishes danced again.
 "What, in the name of the devil, hath come over  the folk? Why sit ye all moping by the fireside, like crows round a dead  horse, when there is man's work to be done within a few short leagues of  ye? Out upon you all, as a set of laggards and hang-backs! By my hilt I  believe that the men of England are all in France already, and that what  is left behind are in sooth the women dressed up in their paltocks and  hosen.
"    "Archer," quoth Hordle John, "you have lied more than once and more than  twice; for which, and also because I see much in you to dislike, I am  sorely tempted to lay you upon your back.
"    "By my hilt! then, I have found a man at last!" shouted the bowman.
  "And, 'fore God, you are a better man than I take you for if you can lay  me on my back, mon garcon.
 I have won the ram more times than there are  toes to my feet, and for seven long years I have found no man in the  Company who could make my jerkin dusty.
"    "We have had enough bobance and boasting," said Hordle John, rising and  throwing off his doublet.
 "I will show you that there are better men  left in England than ever went thieving to France.
"    "Pasques Dieu!" cried the archer, loosening his jerkin, and eyeing his  foeman over with the keen glance of one who is a judge of manhood.
  "I have only once before seen such a body of a man.
 By your leave, my  red-headed friend, I should be right sorry to exchange buffets with  you; and I will allow that there is no man in the Company who would  pull against you on a rope; so let that be a salve to your pride.
 On  the other hand I should judge that you have led a life of ease for some  months back, and that my muscle is harder than your own.
 I am ready to  wager upon myself against you if you are not afeard.
"    "Afeard, thou lurden!" growled big John.
 "I never saw the face yet of  the man that I was afeard of.
 Come out, and we shall see who is the  better man.
"    "But the wager?"    "I have nought to wager.
 Come out for the love and the lust of the  thing.
"    "Nought to wager!" cried the soldier.
 "Why, you have that which I covet  above all things.
 It is that big body of thine that I am after.
 See,  now, mon garcon.
 I have a French feather-bed there, which I have been at  pains to keep these years back.
 I had it at the sacking of Issodun, and  the King himself hath not such a bed.
 If you throw me, it is thine; but,  if I throw you, then you are under a vow to take bow and bill and hie  with me to France, there to serve in the White Company as long as we be  enrolled.
"    "A fair wager!" cried all the travellers, moving back their benches and  trestles, so as to give fair field for the wrestlers.
    "Then you may bid farewell to your bed, soldier," said Hordle John.
    "Nay; I shall keep the bed, and I shall have you to France in spite  of your teeth, and you shall live to thank me for it.
 How shall it be,  then, mon enfant? Collar and elbow, or close-lock, or catch how you  can?"    "To the devil with your tricks," said John, opening and shutting his  great red hands.
 "Stand forth, and let me clip thee.
"    "Shalt clip me as best you can then," quoth the archer, moving out into  the open space, and keeping a most wary eye upon his opponent.
 He had  thrown off his green jerkin, and his chest was covered only by a pink  silk jupon, or undershirt, cut low in the neck and sleeveless.
 Hordle  John was stripped from his waist upwards, and his huge body, with his  great muscles swelling out like the gnarled roots of an oak, towered  high above the soldier.
 The other, however, though near a foot shorter,  was a man of great strength; and there was a gloss upon his white skin  which was wanting in the heavier limbs of the renegade monk.
 He was  quick on his feet, too, and skilled at the game; so that it was clear,  from the poise of head and shine of eye, that he counted the chances to  be in his favor.
 It would have been hard that night, through the whole  length of England, to set up a finer pair in face of each other.
    Big John stood waiting in the centre with a sullen, menacing eye, and  his red hair in a bristle, while the archer paced lightly and swiftly to  the right and the left with crooked knee and hands advanced.
 Then with a  sudden dash, so swift and fierce that the eye could scarce follow it, he  flew in upon his man and locked his leg round him.
 It was a grip that,  between men of equal strength, would mean a fall; but Hordle John tore  him off from him as he might a rat, and hurled him across the room, so  that his head cracked up against the wooden wall.
    "Ma foi!" cried the bowman, passing his fingers through his curls, "you  were not far from the feather-bed then, mon gar.
 A little more and this  good hostel would have a new window.
"    Nothing daunted, he approached his man once more, but this time with  more caution than before.
 With a quick feint he threw the other off his  guard, and then, bounding upon him, threw his legs round his waist and  his arms round his bull-neck, in the hope of bearing him to the ground  with the sudden shock.
 With a bellow of rage, Hordle John squeezed him  limp in his huge arms; and then, picking him up, cast him down upon the  floor with a force which might well have splintered a bone or two,  had not the archer with the most perfect coolness clung to the other's  forearms to break his fall.
 As it was, he dropped upon his feet and  kept his balance, though it sent a jar through his frame which set every  joint a-creaking.
 He bounded back from his perilous foeman; but the  other, heated by the bout, rushed madly after him, and so gave the  practised wrestler the very vantage for which he had planned.
 As big  John flung himself upon him, the archer ducked under the great red hands  that clutched for him, and, catching his man round the thighs, hurled  him over his shoulder--helped as much by his own mad rush as by the  trained strength of the heave.
 To Alleyne's eye, it was as if John had  taken unto himself wings and flown.
 As he hurtled through the air, with  giant limbs revolving, the lad's heart was in his mouth; for surely no  man ever yet had such a fall and came scathless out of it.
 In truth,  hardy as the man was, his neck had been assuredly broken had he not  pitched head first on the very midriff of the drunken artist, who was  slumbering so peacefully in the corner, all unaware of these stirring  doings.
 The luckless limner, thus suddenly brought out from his dreams,  sat up with a piercing yell, while Hordle John bounded back into the  circle almost as rapidly as he had left it.
    "One more fall, by all the saints!" he cried, throwing out his arms.
    "Not I," quoth the archer, pulling on his clothes, "I have come well out  of the business.
 I would sooner wrestle with the great bear of Navarre.
"    "It was a trick," cried John.
    "Aye was it.
 By my ten finger-bones! it is a trick that will add a  proper man to the ranks of the Company.
"    "Oh, for that," said the other, "I count it not a fly; for I had  promised myself a good hour ago that I should go with thee, since the  life seems to be a goodly and proper one.
 Yet I would fain have had the  feather-bed.
"    "I doubt it not, mon ami," quoth the archer, going back to his tankard.
  "Here is to thee, lad, and may we be good comrades to each other! But,  hola! what is it that ails our friend of the wrathful face?"    The unfortunate limner had been sitting up rubbing himself ruefully  and staring about with a vacant gaze, which showed that he knew neither  where he was nor what had occurred to him.
 Suddenly, however, a flash  of intelligence had come over his sodden features, and he rose and  staggered for the door.
 "'Ware the ale!" he said in a hoarse whisper,  shaking a warning finger at the company.
 "Oh, holy Virgin, 'ware the  ale!" and slapping his hands to his injury, he flitted off into the  darkness, amid a shout of laughter, in which the vanquished joined as  merrily as the victor.
 The remaining forester and the two laborers  were also ready for the road, and the rest of the company turned to the  blankets which Dame Eliza and the maid had laid out for them upon the  floor.
 Alleyne, weary with the unwonted excitements of the day, was soon  in a deep slumber broken only by fleeting visions of twittering legs,  cursing beggars, black robbers, and the many strange folk whom he had  met at the "Pied Merlin.
"        .
 HOW THE THREE COMRADES JOURNEYED THROUGH THE WOODLANDS.
      At early dawn the country inn was all alive, for it was rare indeed  that an hour of daylight would be wasted at a time when lighting was so  scarce and dear.
 Indeed, early as it was when Dame Eliza began to stir,  it seemed that others could be earlier still, for the door was ajar,  and the learned student of Cambridge had taken himself off, with a  mind which was too intent upon the high things of antiquity to stoop  to consider the four-pence which he owed for bed and board.
 It was the  shrill out-cry of the landlady when she found her loss, and the clucking  of the hens, which had streamed in through the open door, that first  broke in upon the slumbers of the tired wayfarers.
    Once afoot, it was not long before the company began to disperse.
 A  sleek mule with red trappings was brought round from some neighboring  shed for the physician, and he ambled away with much dignity upon his  road to Southampton.
 The tooth-drawer and the gleeman called for a cup  of small ale apiece, and started off together for Ringwood fair, the old  jongleur looking very yellow in the eye and swollen in the face after  his overnight potations.
 The archer, however, who had drunk more than  any man in the room, was as merry as a grig, and having kissed the  matron and chased the maid up the ladder once more, he went out to the  brook, and came back with the water dripping from his face and hair.
    "Hola! my man of peace," he cried to Alleyne, "whither are you bent this  morning?"    "To Minstead," quoth he.
 "My brother Simon Edricson is socman there, and  I go to bide with him for a while.
 I prythee, let me have my score, good  dame.
"    "Score, indeed!" cried she, standing with upraised hands in front of the  panel on which Alleyne had worked the night before.
 "Say, rather what  it is that I owe to thee, good youth.
 Aye, this is indeed a pied merlin,  and with a leveret under its claws, as I am a living woman.
 By the rood  of Waltham! but thy touch is deft and dainty.
"    "And see the red eye of it!" cried the maid.
    "Aye, and the open beak.
"    "And the ruffled wing," added Hordle John.
    "By my hilt!" cried the archer, "it is the very bird itself.
"    The young clerk flushed with pleasure at this chorus of praise, rude and  indiscriminate indeed, and yet so much heartier and less grudging than  any which he had ever heard from the critical brother Jerome, or the  short-spoken Abbot.
 There was, it would seem, great kindness as well as  great wickedness in this world, of which he had heard so little that was  good.
 His hostess would hear nothing of his paying either for bed or  for board, while the archer and Hordle John placed a hand upon either  shoulder and led him off to the board, where some smoking fish, a dish  of spinach, and a jug of milk were laid out for their breakfast.
    "I should not be surprised to learn, mon camarade," said the soldier, as  he heaped a slice of fish upon Alleyne's tranchoir of bread, "that you  could read written things, since you are so ready with your brushes and  pigments.
"    "It would be shame to the good brothers of Beaulieu if I could not," he  answered, "seeing that I have been their clerk this ten years back.
"    The bowman looked at him with great respect.
 "Think of that!" said he.
  "And you with not a hair to your face, and a skin like a girl.
 I can  shoot three hundred and fifty paces with my little popper there, and  four hundred and twenty with the great war-bow; yet I can make nothing  of this, nor read my own name if you were to set 'Sam Aylward' up  against me.
 In the whole Company there was only one man who could read,  and he fell down a well at the taking of Ventadour, which proves that  the thing is not suited to a soldier, though most needful to a clerk.
"    "I can make some show at it," said big John; "though I was scarce long  enough among the monks to catch the whole trick of it.
    "Here, then, is something to try upon," quoth the archer, pulling a  square of parchment from the inside of his tunic.
 It was tied securely  with a broad band of purple silk, and firmly sealed at either end with a  large red seal.
 John pored long and earnestly over the inscription upon  the back, with his brows bent as one who bears up against great mental  strain.
    "Not having read much of late," he said, "I am loth to say too much  about what this may be.
 Some might say one thing and some another, just  as one bowman loves the yew, and a second will not shoot save with the  ash.
 To me, by the length and the look of it, I should judge this to be  a verse from one of the Psalms.
"    The bowman shook his head.
 "It is scarce likely," he said, "that Sir  Claude Latour should send me all the way across seas with nought more  weighty than a psalm-verse.
 You have clean overshot the butts this time,  mon camarade.
 Give it to the little one.
 I will wager my feather-bed  that he makes more sense of it.
"    "Why, it is written in the French tongue," said Alleyne, "and in a  right clerkly hand.
 This is how it runs: 'A le moult puissant et moult  honorable chevalier, Sir Nigel Loring de Christchurch, de son tres  fidele ami Sir Claude Latour, capitaine de la Compagnie blanche,  chatelain de Biscar, grand seigneur de Montchateau, vavaseur de le  renomme Gaston, Comte de Foix, tenant les droits de la haute justice, de  la milieu, et de la basse.
' Which signifies in our speech: 'To the very  powerful and very honorable knight, Sir Nigel Loring of Christchurch,  from his very faithful friend Sir Claude Latour, captain of the White  Company, chatelain of Biscar, grand lord of Montchateau and vassal to  the renowned Gaston, Count of Foix, who holds the rights of the high  justice, the middle and the low.
'"    "Look at that now!" cried the bowman in triumph.
 "That is just what he  would have said.
"    "I can see now that it is even so," said John, examining the parchment  again.
 "Though I scarce understand this high, middle and low.
"    "By my hilt! you would understand it if you were Jacques Bonhomme.
 The  low justice means that you may fleece him, and the middle that you may  torture him, and the high that you may slay him.
 That is about the truth  of it.
 But this is the letter which I am to take; and since the platter  is clean it is time that we trussed up and were afoot.
 You come with  me, mon gros Jean; and as to you, little one, where did you say that you  journeyed?"    "To Minstead.
"    "Ah, yes.
 I know this forest country well, though I was born myself  in the Hundred of Easebourne, in the Rape of Chichester, hard by the  village of Midhurst.
 Yet I have not a word to say against the Hampton  men, for there are no better comrades or truer archers in the whole  Company than some who learned to loose the string in these very parts.
  We shall travel round with you to Minstead lad, seeing that it is little  out of our way.
"    "I am ready," said Alleyne, right pleased at the thought of such company  upon the road.
    "So am not I.
 I must store my plunder at this inn, since the hostess is  an honest woman.
 Hola! ma cherie, I wish to leave with you my gold-work,  my velvet, my silk, my feather bed, my incense-boat, my ewer, my naping  linen, and all the rest of it.
 I take only the money in a linen bag,  and the box of rose colored sugar which is a gift from my captain to the  Lady Loring.
 Wilt guard my treasure for me?"    "It shall be put in the safest loft, good archer.
 Come when you may, you  shall find it ready for you.
"    "Now, there is a true friend!" cried the bowman, taking her hand.
 "There  is a bonne amie! English land and English women, say I, and French wine  and French plunder.
 I shall be back anon, mon ange.
 I am a lonely man,  my sweeting, and I must settle some day when the wars are over and done.
  Mayhap you and I----Ah, mechante, mechante! There is la petite peeping  from behind the door.
 Now, John, the sun is over the trees; you must be  brisker than this when the bugleman blows 'Bows and Bills.
'"    "I have been waiting this time back," said Hordle John gruffly.
    "Then we must be off.
 Adieu, ma vie! The two livres shall settle the  score and buy some ribbons against the next kermesse.
 Do not forget Sam  Aylward, for his heart shall ever be thine alone--and thine, ma petite!  So, marchons, and may St.
 Julian grant us as good quarters elsewhere!"    The sun had risen over Ashurst and Denny woods, and was shining  brightly, though the eastern wind had a sharp flavor to it, and the  leaves were flickering thickly from the trees.
 In the High Street of  Lyndhurst the wayfarers had to pick their way, for the little town  was crowded with the guardsmen, grooms, and yeomen prickers who were  attached to the King's hunt.
 The King himself was staying at Castle  Malwood, but several of his suite had been compelled to seek such  quarters as they might find in the wooden or wattle-and-daub cottages of  the village.
 Here and there a small escutcheon, peeping from a  glassless window, marked the night's lodging of knight or baron.
 These  coats-of-arms could be read, where a scroll would be meaningless, and  the bowman, like most men of his age, was well versed in the common  symbols of heraldry.
    "There is the Saracen's head of Sir Bernard Brocas," quoth he.
 "I saw  him last at the ruffle at Poictiers some ten years back, when he bore  himself like a man.
 He is the master of the King's horse, and can sing  a right jovial stave, though in that he cannot come nigh to Sir John  Chandos, who is first at the board or in the saddle.
 Three martlets on a  field azure, that must be one of the Luttrells.
 By the crescent upon it,  it should be the second son of old Sir Hugh, who had a bolt through his  ankle at the intaking of Romorantin, he having rushed into the fray ere  his squire had time to clasp his solleret to his greave.
 There too is  the hackle which is the old device of the De Brays.
 I have served under  Sir Thomas de Bray, who was as jolly as a pie, and a lusty swordsman  until he got too fat for his harness.
"    So the archer gossiped as the three wayfarers threaded their way among  the stamping horses, the busy grooms, and the knots of pages and squires  who disputed over the merits of their masters' horses and deer-hounds.
  As they passed the old church, which stood upon a mound at the left-hand  side of the village street the door was flung open, and a stream of  worshippers wound down the sloping path, coming from the morning mass,  all chattering like a cloud of jays.
 Alleyne bent knee and doffed hat at  the sight of the open door; but ere he had finished an ave his comrades  were out of sight round the curve of the path, and he had to run to  overtake them.
    "What!" he said, "not one word of prayer before God's own open house?  How can ye hope for His blessing upon the day?"    "My friend," said Hordle John, "I have prayed so much during the last  two months, not only during the day, but at matins, lauds, and the like,  when I could scarce keep my head upon my shoulders for nodding, that I  feel that I have somewhat over-prayed myself.
"    "How can a man have too much religion?" cried Alleyne earnestly.
 "It is  the one thing that availeth.
 A man is but a beast as he lives from day  to day, eating and drinking, breathing and sleeping.
 It is only when  he raises himself, and concerns himself with the immortal spirit within  him, that he becomes in very truth a man.
 Bethink ye how sad a thing  it would be that the blood of the Redeemer should be spilled to no  purpose.
"    "Bless the lad, if he doth not blush like any girl, and yet preach like  the whole College of Cardinals," cried the archer.
    "In truth I blush that any one so weak and so unworthy as I should  try to teach another that which he finds it so passing hard to follow  himself.
"    "Prettily said, mon garcon.
 Touching that same slaying of the Redeemer,  it was a bad business.
 A good padre in France read to us from a scroll  the whole truth of the matter.
 The soldiers came upon him in the garden.
  In truth, these Apostles of His may have been holy men, but they were of  no great account as men-at-arms.
 There was one, indeed, Sir Peter, who  smote out like a true man; but, unless he is belied, he did but clip  a varlet's ear, which was no very knightly deed.
 By these ten  finger-bones! had I been there with Black Simon of Norwich, and but one  score picked men of the Company, we had held them in play.
 Could we do  no more, we had at least filled the false knight, Sir Judas, so full of  English arrows that he would curse the day that ever he came on such an  errand.
"    The young clerk smiled at his companion's earnestness.
 "Had He wished  help," he said, "He could have summoned legions of archangels from  heaven, so what need had He of your poor bow and arrow? Besides, bethink  you of His own words--that those who live by the sword shall perish by  the sword.
"    "And how could man die better?" asked the archer.
 "If I had my wish, it  would be to fall so--not, mark you, in any mere skirmish of the Company,  but in a stricken field, with the great lion banner waving over us and  the red oriflamme in front, amid the shouting of my fellows and the  twanging of the strings.
 But let it be sword, lance, or bolt that  strikes me down: for I should think it shame to die from an iron ball  from the fire-crake or bombard or any such unsoldierly weapon, which is  only fitted to scare babes with its foolish noise and smoke.
"    "I have heard much even in the quiet cloisters of these new and dreadful  engines," quoth Alleyne.
 "It is said, though I can scarce bring myself  to believe it, that they will send a ball twice as far as a bowman  can shoot his shaft, and with such force as to break through armor of  proof.
"    "True enough, my lad.
 But while the armorer is thrusting in his  devil's-dust, and dropping his ball, and lighting his flambeau, I  can very easily loose six shafts, or eight maybe, so he hath no great  vantage after all.
 Yet I will not deny that at the intaking of a town  it is well to have good store of bombards.
 I am told that at Calais they  made dints in the wall that a man might put his head into.
 But surely,  comrades, some one who is grievously hurt hath passed along this road  before us.
"    All along the woodland track there did indeed run a scattered straggling  trail of blood-marks, sometimes in single drops, and in other places in  broad, ruddy gouts, smudged over the dead leaves or crimsoning the white  flint stones.
    "It must be a stricken deer," said John.
    "Nay, I am woodman enough to see that no deer hath passed this way this  morning; and yet the blood is fresh.
 But hark to the sound!"    They stood listening all three with sidelong heads.
 Through the silence  of the great forest there came a swishing, whistling sound, mingled  with the most dolorous groans, and the voice of a man raised in a  high quavering kind of song.
 The comrades hurried onwards eagerly, and  topping the brow of a small rising they saw upon the other side the  source from which these strange noises arose.
    A tall man, much stooped in the shoulders, was walking slowly with  bended head and clasped hands in the centre of the path.
 He was dressed  from head to foot in a long white linen cloth, and a high white cap  with a red cross printed upon it.
 His gown was turned back from his  shoulders, and the flesh there was a sight to make a man wince, for it  was all beaten to a pulp, and the blood was soaking into his gown and  trickling down upon the ground.
 Behind him walked a smaller man with his  hair touched with gray, who was clad in the same white garb.
 He intoned  a long whining rhyme in the French tongue, and at the end of every line  he raised a thick cord, all jagged with pellets of lead, and smote his  companion across the shoulders until the blood spurted again.
 Even as  the three wayfarers stared, however, there was a sudden change, for the  smaller man, having finished his song, loosened his own gown and handed  the scourge to the other, who took up the stave once more and lashed  his companion with all the strength of his bare and sinewy arm.
 So,  alternately beating and beaten, they made their dolorous way through the  beautiful woods and under the amber arches of the fading beech-trees,  where the calm strength and majesty of Nature might serve to rebuke the  foolish energies and misspent strivings of mankind.
    Such a spectacle was new to Hordle John or to Alleyne Edricson; but the  archer treated it lightly, as a common matter enough.
    "These are the Beating Friars, otherwise called the Flagellants," quoth  he.
 "I marvel that ye should have come upon none of them before, for  across the water they are as common as gallybaggers.
 I have heard that  there are no English among them, but that they are from France, Italy  and Bohemia.
 En avant, camarades! that we may have speech with them.
"    As they came up to them, Alleyne could hear the doleful dirge which the  beater was chanting, bringing down his heavy whip at the end of each  line, while the groans of the sufferer formed a sort of dismal chorus.
  It was in old French, and ran somewhat in this way:            Or avant, entre nous tous freres          Battons nos charognes bien fort          En remembrant la grant misere          De Dieu et sa piteuse mort          Qui fut pris en la gent amere          Et vendus et trais a tort          Et bastu sa chair, vierge et dere          Au nom de ce battons plus fort.
    Then at the end of the verse the scourge changed hands and the chanting  began anew.
    "Truly, holy fathers," said the archer in French as they came abreast of  them, "you have beaten enough for to-day.
 The road is all spotted like a  shambles at Martinmas.
 Why should ye mishandle yourselves thus?"    "C'est pour vos peches--pour vos peches," they droned, looking at the  travellers with sad lack-lustre eyes, and then bent to their bloody  work once more without heed to the prayers and persuasions which were  addressed to them.
 Finding all remonstrance useless, the three comrades  hastened on their way, leaving these strange travellers to their dreary  task.
    "Mort Dieu!" cried the bowman, "there is a bucketful or more of my blood  over in France, but it was all spilled in hot fight, and I should think  twice before I drew it drop by drop as these friars are doing.
 By my  hilt! our young one here is as white as a Picardy cheese.
 What is amiss  then, mon cher?"    "It is nothing," Alleyne answered.
 "My life has been too quiet, I am not  used to such sights.
"    "Ma foi!" the other cried, "I have never yet seen a man who was so stout  of speech and yet so weak of heart.
"    "Not so, friend," quoth big John; "it is not weakness of heart for I  know the lad well.
 His heart is as good as thine or mine but he hath  more in his pate than ever you will carry under that tin pot of thine,  and as a consequence he can see farther into things, so that they weigh  upon him more.
"    "Surely to any man it is a sad sight," said Alleyne, "to see these  holy men, who have done no sin themselves, suffering so for the sins of  others.
 Saints are they, if in this age any may merit so high a name.
"    "I count them not a fly," cried Hordle John; "for who is the better for  all their whipping and yowling? They are like other friars, I trow, when  all is done.
 Let them leave their backs alone, and beat the pride out of  their hearts.
"    "By the three kings! there is sooth in what you say," remarked the  archer.
 "Besides, methinks if I were le bon Dieu, it would bring me  little joy to see a poor devil cutting the flesh off his bones; and I  should think that he had but a small opinion of me, that he should hope  to please me by such provost-marshal work.
 No, by my hilt! I should look  with a more loving eye upon a jolly archer who never harmed a fallen foe  and never feared a hale one.
"    "Doubtless you mean no sin," said Alleyne.
 "If your words are wild, it  is not for me to judge them.
 Can you not see that there are other foes  in this world besides Frenchmen, and as much glory to be gained in  conquering them? Would it not be a proud day for knight or squire if he  could overthrow seven adversaries in the lists? Yet here are we in the  lists of life, and there come the seven black champions against us Sir  Pride, Sir Covetousness, Sir Lust, Sir Anger, Sir Gluttony, Sir Envy,  and Sir Sloth.
 Let a man lay those seven low, and he shall have the  prize of the day, from the hands of the fairest queen of beauty, even  from the Virgin-Mother herself.
 It is for this that these men mortify  their flesh, and to set us an example, who would pamper ourselves  overmuch.
 I say again that they are God's own saints, and I bow my head  to them.
"    "And so you shall, mon petit," replied the archer.
 "I have not heard  a man speak better since old Dom Bertrand died, who was at one time  chaplain to the White Company.
 He was a very valiant man, but at  the battle of Brignais he was spitted through the body by a Hainault  man-at-arms.
 For this we had an excommunication read against the man,  when next we saw our holy father at Avignon; but as we had not his name,  and knew nothing of him, save that he rode a dapple-gray roussin, I have  feared sometimes that the blight may have settled upon the wrong man.
"    "Your Company has been, then, to bow knee before our holy father, the  Pope Urban, the prop and centre of Christendom?" asked Alleyne, much  interested.
 "Perchance you have yourself set eyes upon his august face?"    "Twice I saw him," said the archer.
 "He was a lean little rat of a man,  with a scab on his chin.
 The first time we had five thousand crowns out  of him, though he made much ado about it.
 The second time we asked ten  thousand, but it was three days before we could come to terms, and I  am of opinion myself that we might have done better by plundering the  palace.
 His chamberlain and cardinals came forth, as I remember, to  ask whether we would take seven thousand crowns with his blessing and  a plenary absolution, or the ten thousand with his solemn ban by bell,  book and candle.
 We were all of one mind that it was best to have the  ten thousand with the curse; but in some way they prevailed upon Sir  John, so that we were blest and shriven against our will.
 Perchance it  is as well, for the Company were in need of it about that time.
"    The pious Alleyne was deeply shocked by this reminiscence.
 Involuntarily  he glanced up and around to see if there were any trace of those  opportune levin-flashes and thunderbolts which, in the "Acta Sanctorum,"  were wont so often to cut short the loose talk of the scoffer.
 The  autumn sun streamed down as brightly as ever, and the peaceful red path  still wound in front of them through the rustling, yellow-tinted forest,  Nature seemed to be too busy with her own concerns to heed the dignity  of an outraged pontiff.
 Yet he felt a sense of weight and reproach  within his breast, as though he had sinned himself in giving ear to such  words.
 The teachings of twenty years cried out against such license.
 It  was not until he had thrown himself down before one of the many wayside  crosses, and had prayed from his heart both for the archer and for  himself, that the dark cloud rolled back again from his spirit.
        .
 THE THREE FRIENDS.
      His companions had passed on whilst he was at his orisons; but his young  blood and the fresh morning air both invited him to a scamper.
 His staff  in one hand and his scrip in the other, with springy step and floating  locks, he raced along the forest path, as active and as graceful as a  young deer.
 He had not far to go, however; for, on turning a corner,  he came on a roadside cottage with a wooden fence-work around it, where  stood big John and Aylward the bowman, staring at something within.
 As  he came up with them, he saw that two little lads, the one about nine  years of age and the other somewhat older, were standing on the plot  in front of the cottage, each holding out a round stick in their left  hands, with their arms stiff and straight from the shoulder, as  silent and still as two small statues.
 They were pretty, blue-eyed,  yellow-haired lads, well made and sturdy, with bronzed skins, which  spoke of a woodland life.
    "Here are young chips from an old bow stave!" cried the soldier in great  delight.
 "This is the proper way to raise children.
 By my hilt! I could  not have trained them better had I the ordering of it myself.
"    "What is it then?" asked Hordle John.
 "They stand very stiff, and I  trust that they have not been struck so.
"    "Nay, they are training their left arms, that they may have a steady  grasp of the bow.
 So my own father trained me, and six days a week I  held out his walking-staff till my arm was heavy as lead.
 Hola, mes  enfants! how long will you hold out?"    "Until the sun is over the great lime-tree, good master," the elder  answered.
    "What would ye be, then? Woodmen? Verderers?"    "Nay, soldiers," they cried both together.
    "By the beard of my father! but ye are whelps of the true breed.
 Why so  keen, then, to be soldiers?"    "That we may fight the Scots," they answered.
 "Daddy will send us to  fight the Scots.
"    "And why the Scots, my pretty lads? We have seen French and Spanish  galleys no further away than Southampton, but I doubt that it will be  some time before the Scots find their way to these parts.
"    "Our business is with the Scots," quoth the elder; "for it was the Scots  who cut off daddy's string fingers and his thumbs.
"    "Aye, lads, it was that," said a deep voice from behind Alleyne's  shoulder.
 Looking round, the wayfarers saw a gaunt, big-boned man, with  sunken cheeks and a sallow face, who had come up behind them.
 He held  up his two hands as he spoke, and showed that the thumbs and two first  fingers had been torn away from each of them.
    "Ma foi, camarade!" cried Aylward.
 "Who hath served thee in so shameful  a fashion?"    "It is easy to see, friend, that you were born far from the marches of  Scotland," quoth the stranger, with a bitter smile.
 "North of Humber  there is no man who would not know the handiwork of Devil Douglas, the  black Lord James.
"    "And how fell you into his hands?" asked John.
    "I am a man of the north country, from the town of Beverley and the  wapentake of Holderness," he answered.
 "There was a day when, from Trent  to Tweed, there was no better marksman than Robin Heathcot.
 Yet, as you  see, he hath left me, as he hath left many another poor border archer,  with no grip for bill or bow.
 Yet the king hath given me a living here  in the southlands, and please God these two lads of mine will pay off  a debt that hath been owing over long.
 What is the price of daddy's  thumbs, boys?"    "Twenty Scottish lives," they answered together.
    "And for the fingers?"    "Half a score.
"    "When they can bend my war-bow, and bring down a squirrel at a hundred  paces, I send them to take service under Johnny Copeland, the Lord of  the Marches and Governor of Carlisle.
 By my soul! I would give the rest  of my fingers to see the Douglas within arrow-flight of them.
"    "May you live to see it," quoth the bowman.
 "And hark ye, mes enfants,  take an old soldier's rede and lay your bodies to the bow, drawing from  hip and thigh as much as from arm.
 Learn also, I pray you, to shoot with  a dropping shaft; for though a bowman may at times be called upon to  shoot straight and fast, yet it is more often that he has to do with a  town-guard behind a wall, or an arbalestier with his mantlet raised when  you cannot hope to do him scathe unless your shaft fall straight upon  him from the clouds.
 I have not drawn string for two weeks, but I may  be able to show ye how such shots should be made.
" He loosened his  long-bow, slung his quiver round to the front, and then glanced keenly  round for a fitting mark.
 There was a yellow and withered stump some  way off, seen under the drooping branches of a lofty oak.
 The archer  measured the distance with his eye; and then, drawing three shafts, he  shot them off with such speed that the first had not reached the mark  ere the last was on the string.
 Each arrow passed high over the oak;  and, of the three, two stuck fair into the stump; while the third,  caught in some wandering puff of wind, was driven a foot or two to one  side.
    "Good!" cried the north countryman.
 "Hearken to him lads! He is a master  bowman.
 Your dad says amen to every word he says.
"    "By my hilt!" said Aylward, "if I am to preach on bowmanship, the whole  long day would scarce give me time for my sermon.
 We have marksmen in  the Company who will notch with a shaft every crevice and joint of a  man-at-arm's harness, from the clasp of his bassinet to the hinge of his  greave.
 But, with your favor, friend, I must gather my arrows again, for  while a shaft costs a penny a poor man can scarce leave them sticking  in wayside stumps.
 We must, then, on our road again, and I hope from my  heart that you may train these two young goshawks here until they are  ready for a cast even at such a quarry as you speak of.
"    Leaving the thumbless archer and his brood, the wayfarers struck through  the scattered huts of Emery Down, and out on to the broad rolling heath  covered deep in ferns and in heather, where droves of the half-wild  black forest pigs were rooting about amongst the hillocks.
 The woods  about this point fall away to the left and the right, while the road  curves upwards and the wind sweeps keenly over the swelling uplands.
 The  broad strips of bracken glowed red and yellow against the black peaty  soil, and a queenly doe who grazed among them turned her white front  and her great questioning eyes towards the wayfarers.
 Alleyne gazed  in admiration at the supple beauty of the creature; but the archer's  fingers played with his quiver, and his eyes glistened with the fell  instinct which urges a man to slaughter.
    "Tete Dieu!" he growled, "were this France, or even Guienne, we should  have a fresh haunch for our none-meat.
 Law or no law, I have a mind to  loose a bolt at her.
"    "I would break your stave across my knee first," cried John, laying his  great hand upon the bow.
 "What! man, I am forest-born, and I know what  comes of it.
 In our own township of Hordle two have lost their eyes and  one his skin for this very thing.
 On my troth, I felt no great love when  I first saw you, but since then I have conceived over much regard for  you to wish to see the verderer's flayer at work upon you.
"    "It is my trade to risk my skin," growled the archer; but none the less  he thrust his quiver over his hip again and turned his face for the  west.
    As they advanced, the path still tended upwards, running from heath into  copses of holly and yew, and so back into heath again.
 It was joyful to  hear the merry whistle of blackbirds as they darted from one clump  of greenery to the other.
 Now and again a peaty amber colored stream  rippled across their way, with ferny over-grown banks, where the blue  kingfisher flitted busily from side to side, or the gray and pensive  heron, swollen with trout and dignity, stood ankle-deep among the  sedges.
 Chattering jays and loud wood-pigeons flapped thickly overhead,  while ever and anon the measured tapping of Nature's carpenter, the  great green woodpecker, sounded from each wayside grove.
 On either side,  as the path mounted, the long sweep of country broadened and expanded,  sloping down on the one side through yellow forest and brown moor to  the distant smoke of Lymington and the blue misty channel which lay  alongside the sky-line, while to the north the woods rolled away, grove  topping grove, to where in the furthest distance the white spire of  Salisbury stood out hard and clear against the cloudless sky.
 To Alleyne  whose days had been spent in the low-lying coastland, the eager upland  air and the wide free country-side gave a sense of life and of the joy  of living which made his young blood tingle in his veins.
 Even the  heavy John was not unmoved by the beauty of their road, while the bowman  whistled lustily or sang snatches of French love songs in a voice which  might have scared the most stout-hearted maiden that ever hearkened to  serenade.
    "I have a liking for that north countryman," he remarked presently.
 "He  hath good power of hatred.
 Couldst see by his cheek and eye that he is  as bitter as verjuice.
 I warm to a man who hath some gall in his liver.
"    "Ah me!" sighed Alleyne.
 "Would it not be better if he had some love in  his heart?"    "I would not say nay to that.
 By my hilt! I shall never be said to be  traitor to the little king.
 Let a man love the sex.
 Pasques Dieu! they  are made to be loved, les petites, from whimple down to shoe-string! I  am right glad, mon garcon, to see that the good monks have trained thee  so wisely and so well.
"    "Nay, I meant not worldly love, but rather that his heart should soften  towards those who have wronged him.
"    The archer shook his head.
 "A man should love those of his own breed,"  said he.
 "But it is not nature that an English-born man should love  a Scot or a Frenchman.
 Ma foi! you have not seen a drove of Nithsdale  raiders on their Galloway nags, or you would not speak of loving them.
 I  would as soon take Beelzebub himself to my arms.
 I fear, mon gar.
, that  they have taught thee but badly at Beaulieu, for surely a bishop knows  more of what is right and what is ill than an abbot can do, and I myself  with these very eyes saw the Bishop of Lincoln hew into a Scottish  hobeler with a battle-axe, which was a passing strange way of showing  him that he loved him.
"    Alleyne scarce saw his way to argue in the face of so decided an opinion  on the part of a high dignitary of the Church.
 "You have borne arms  against the Scots, then?" he asked.
    "Why, man, I first loosed string in battle when I was but a lad, younger  by two years than you, at Neville's Cross, under the Lord Mowbray.
  Later, I served under the Warden of Berwick, that very John Copeland of  whom our friend spake, the same who held the King of Scots to ransom.
 Ma  foi! it is rough soldiering, and a good school for one who would learn  to be hardy and war-wise.
"    "I have heard that the Scots are good men of war," said Hordle John.
    "For axemen and for spearmen I have not seen their match," the archer  answered.
 "They can travel, too, with bag of meal and gridiron slung  to their sword-belt, so that it is ill to follow them.
 There are scant  crops and few beeves in the borderland, where a man must reap his grain  with sickle in one fist and brown bill in the other.
 On the other hand,  they are the sorriest archers that I have ever seen, and cannot so much  as aim with the arbalest, to say nought of the long-bow.
 Again, they are  mostly poor folk, even the nobles among them, so that there are few who  can buy as good a brigandine of chain-mail as that which I am wearing,  and it is ill for them to stand up against our own knights, who carry  the price of five Scotch farms upon their chest and shoulders.
 Man for  man, with equal weapons, they are as worthy and valiant men as could be  found in the whole of Christendom.
"    "And the French?" asked Alleyne, to whom the archer's light gossip had  all the relish that the words of the man of action have for the recluse.
    "The French are also very worthy men.
 We have had great good fortune in  France, and it hath led to much bobance and camp-fire talk, but I have  ever noticed that those who know the most have the least to say about  it.
 I have seen Frenchmen fight both in open field, in the intaking and  the defending of towns or castlewicks, in escalados, camisades, night  forays, bushments, sallies, outfalls, and knightly spear-runnings.
 Their  knights and squires, lad, are every whit as good as ours, and I could  pick out a score of those who ride behind Du Guesclin who would hold the  lists with sharpened lances against the best men in the army of England.
  On the other hand, their common folk are so crushed down with gabelle,  and poll-tax, and every manner of cursed tallage, that the spirit has  passed right out of them.
 It is a fool's plan to teach a man to be a  cur in peace, and think that he will be a lion in war.
 Fleece them like  sheep and sheep they will remain.
 If the nobles had not conquered  the poor folk it is like enough that we should not have conquered the  nobles.
"    "But they must be sorry folk to bow down to the rich in such a fashion,"  said big John.
 "I am but a poor commoner of England myself, and yet I  know something of charters, liberties, franchises, usages, privileges,  customs, and the like.
 If these be broken, then all men know that it is  time to buy arrow-heads.
"    "Aye, but the men of the law are strong in France as well as the men  of war.
 By my hilt! I hold that a man has more to fear there from the  ink-pot of the one than from the iron of the other.
 There is ever some  cursed sheepskin in their strong boxes to prove that the rich man should  be richer and the poor man poorer.
 It would scarce pass in England, but  they are quiet folk over the water.
"    "And what other nations have you seen in your travels, good sir?" asked  Alleyne Edricson.
 His young mind hungered for plain facts of life, after  the long course of speculation and of mysticism on which he had been  trained.
    "I have seen the low countryman in arms, and I have nought to say  against him.
 Heavy and slow is he by nature, and is not to be brought  into battle for the sake of a lady's eyelash or the twang of a  minstrel's string, like the hotter blood of the south.
 But ma foi! lay  hand on his wool-bales, or trifle with his velvet of Bruges, and out  buzzes every stout burgher, like bees from the tee-hole, ready to lay on  as though it were his one business in life.
 By our lady! they have shown  the French at Courtrai and elsewhere that they are as deft in wielding  steel as in welding it.
"    "And the men of Spain?"    "They too are very hardy soldiers, the more so as for many hundred years  they have had to fight hard against the cursed followers of the black  Mahound, who have pressed upon them from the south, and still, as I  understand, hold the fairer half of the country.
 I had a turn with them  upon the sea when they came over to Winchelsea and the good queen with  her ladies sat upon the cliffs looking down at us, as if it had been  joust or tourney.
 By my hilt! it was a sight that was worth the seeing,  for all that was best in England was out on the water that day.
 We went  forth in little ships and came back in great galleys--for of fifty tall  ships of Spain, over two score flew the Cross of St.
 George ere the sun  had set.
 But now, youngster, I have answered you freely, and I trow it  is time that you answered me.
 Let things be plat and plain between us.
 I  am a man who shoots straight at his mark.
 You saw the things I had  with me at yonder hostel: name which you will, save only the box of  rose-colored sugar which I take to the Lady Loring, and you shall have  it if you will but come with me to France.
"    "Nay," said Alleyne, "I would gladly come with ye to France or where  else ye will, just to list to your talk, and because ye are the only two  friends that I have in the whole wide world outside of the cloisters;  but, indeed, it may not be, for my duty is towards my brother, seeing  that father and mother are dead, and he my elder.
 Besides, when ye talk  of taking me to France, ye do not conceive how useless I should be to  you, seeing that neither by training nor by nature am I fitted for the  wars, and there seems to be nought but strife in those parts.
"    "That comes from my fool's talk," cried the archer; "for being a man of  no learning myself, my tongue turns to blades and targets, even as  my hand does.
 Know then that for every parchment in England there are  twenty in France.
 For every statue, cut gem, shrine, carven screen,  or what else might please the eye of a learned clerk, there are a good  hundred to our one.
 At the spoiling of Carcasonne I have seen chambers  stored with writing, though not one man in our Company could read them.
  Again, in Arles and Nimes, and other towns that I could name, there are  the great arches and fortalices still standing which were built of old  by giant men who came from the south.
 Can I not see by your brightened  eye how you would love to look upon these things? Come then with me,  and, by these ten finger-bones! there is not one of them which you shall  not see.
"    "I should indeed love to look upon them," Alleyne answered; "but I have  come from Beaulieu for a purpose, and I must be true to my service, even  as thou art true to thine.
"    "Bethink you again, mon ami," quoth Aylward, "that you might do much  good yonder, since there are three hundred men in the Company, and none  who has ever a word of grace for them, and yet the Virgin knows that  there was never a set of men who were in more need of it.
 Sickerly the  one duty may balance the other.
 Your brother hath done without you this  many a year, and, as I gather, he hath never walked as far as Beaulieu  to see you during all that time, so he cannot be in any great need of  you.
"    "Besides," said John, "the Socman of Minstead is a by-word through the  forest, from Bramshaw Hill to Holmesley Walk.
 He is a drunken, brawling,  perilous churl, as you may find to your cost.
"    "The more reason that I should strive to mend him," quoth Alleyne.
  "There is no need to urge me, friends, for my own wishes would draw  me to France, and it would be a joy to me if I could go with you.
 But  indeed and indeed it cannot be, so here I take my leave of you, for  yonder square tower amongst the trees upon the right must surely be the  church of Minstead, and I may reach it by this path through the woods.
"    "Well, God be with thee, lad!" cried the archer, pressing Alleyne to his  heart.
 "I am quick to love, and quick to hate and 'fore God I am loth to  part.
"    "Would it not be well," said John, "that we should wait here, and see  what manner of greeting you have from your brother.
 You may prove to be  as welcome as the king's purveyor to the village dame.
"    "Nay, nay," he answered; "ye must not bide for me, for where I go I  stay.
"    "Yet it may be as well that you should know whither we go," said the  archer.
 "We shall now journey south through the woods until we come out  upon the Christchurch road, and so onwards, hoping to-night to reach the  castle of Sir William Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, of which Sir Nigel  Loring is constable.
 There we shall bide, and it is like enough that for  a month or more you may find us there, ere we are ready for our viage  back to France.
"    It was hard indeed for Alleyne to break away from these two new but  hearty friends, and so strong was the combat between his conscience  and his inclinations that he dared not look round, lest his resolution  should slip away from him.
 It was not until he was deep among the tree  trunks that he cast a glance backwards, when he found that he could  still see them through the branches on the road above him.
 The archer  was standing with folded arms, his bow jutting from over his shoulder,  and the sun gleaming brightly upon his head-piece and the links of  his chain-mail.
 Beside him stood his giant recruit, still clad in the  home-spun and ill-fitting garments of the fuller of Lymington, with arms  and legs shooting out of his scanty garb.
 Even as Alleyne watched them  they turned upon their heels and plodded off together upon their way.
        .
 HOW STRANGE THINGS BEFELL IN MINSTEAD WOOD.
      The path which the young clerk had now to follow lay through a  magnificent forest of the very heaviest timber, where the giant bowls  of oak and of beech formed long aisles in every direction, shooting  up their huge branches to build the majestic arches of Nature's own  cathedral.
 Beneath lay a broad carpet of the softest and greenest moss,  flecked over with fallen leaves, but yielding pleasantly to the foot of  the traveller.
 The track which guided him was one so seldom used that in  places it lost itself entirely among the grass, to reappear as a reddish  rut between the distant tree trunks.
 It was very still here in the heart  of the woodlands.
 The gentle rustle of the branches and the distant  cooing of pigeons were the only sounds which broke in upon the silence,  save that once Alleyne heard afar off a merry call upon a hunting bugle  and the shrill yapping of the hounds.
    It was not without some emotion that he looked upon the scene around  him, for, in spite of his secluded life, he knew enough of the ancient  greatness of his own family to be aware that the time had been when they  had held undisputed and paramount sway over all that tract of country.
  His father could trace his pure Saxon lineage back to that Godfrey Malf  who had held the manors of Bisterne and of Minstead at the time when the  Norman first set mailed foot upon English soil.
 The afforestation of the  district, however, and its conversion into a royal demesne had  clipped off a large section of his estate, while other parts had been  confiscated as a punishment for his supposed complicity in an abortive  Saxon rising.
 The fate of the ancestor had been typical of that of his  descendants.
 During three hundred years their domains had gradually  contracted, sometimes through royal or feudal encroachment, and  sometimes through such gifts to the Church as that with which Alleyne's  father had opened the doors of Beaulieu Abbey to his younger son.
 The  importance of the family had thus dwindled, but they still retained the  old Saxon manor-house, with a couple of farms and a grove large enough  to afford pannage to a hundred pigs--"sylva de centum porcis," as the  old family parchments describe it.
 Above all, the owner of the soil  could still hold his head high as the veritable Socman of Minstead--that  is, as holding the land in free socage, with no feudal superior, and  answerable to no man lower than the king.
 Knowing this, Alleyne felt  some little glow of worldly pride as he looked for the first time  upon the land with which so many generations of his ancestors had been  associated.
 He pushed on the quicker, twirling his staff merrily, and  looking out at every turn of the path for some sign of the old Saxon  residence.
 He was suddenly arrested, however, by the appearance of a  wild-looking fellow armed with a club, who sprang out from behind a tree  and barred his passage.
 He was a rough, powerful peasant, with cap and  tunic of untanned sheepskin, leather breeches, and galligaskins round  legs and feet.
    "Stand!" he shouted, raising his heavy cudgel to enforce the order.
 "Who  are you who walk so freely through the wood? Whither would you go, and  what is your errand?"    "Why should I answer your questions, my friend?" said Alleyne, standing  on his guard.
    "Because your tongue may save your pate.
 But where have I looked upon  your face before?"    "No longer ago than last night at the 'Pied Merlin,'" the clerk  answered, recognizing the escaped serf who had been so outspoken as to  his wrongs.
    "By the Virgin! yes.
 You were the little clerk who sat so mum in the  corner, and then cried fy on the gleeman.
 What hast in the scrip?"    "Naught of any price.
"    "How can I tell that, clerk? Let me see.
"    "Not I.
"    "Fool! I could pull you limb from limb like a pullet.
 What would you  have? Hast forgot that we are alone far from all men? How can your  clerkship help you? Wouldst lose scrip and life too?"    "I will part with neither without fight.
"    "A fight, quotha? A fight betwixt spurred cock and new hatched chicken!  Thy fighting days may soon be over.
"    "Hadst asked me in the name of charity I would have given freely," cried  Alleyne.
 "As it stands, not one farthing shall you have with my free  will, and when I see my brother, the Socman of Minstead, he will raise  hue and cry from vill to vill, from hundred to hundred, until you are  taken as a common robber and a scourge to the country.
"    The outlaw sank his club.
 "The Socman's brother!" he gasped.
 "Now,  by the keys of Peter! I had rather that hand withered and tongue was  palsied ere I had struck or miscalled you.
 If you are the Socman's  brother you are one of the right side, I warrant, for all your clerkly  dress.
"    "His brother I am," said Alleyne.
 "But if I were not, is that reason why  you should molest me on the king's ground?"    "I give not the pip of an apple for king or for noble," cried the serf  passionately.
 "Ill have I had from them, and ill I shall repay them.
 I  am a good friend to my friends, and, by the Virgin! an evil foeman to my  foes.
"    "And therefore the worst of foemen to thyself," said Alleyne.
 "But I  pray you, since you seem to know him, to point out to me the shortest  path to my brother's house.
"    The serf was about to reply, when the clear ringing call of a bugle  burst from the wood close behind them, and Alleyne caught sight for  an instant of the dun side and white breast of a lordly stag glancing  swiftly betwixt the distant tree trunks.
 A minute later came the shaggy  deer-hounds, a dozen or fourteen of them, running on a hot scent, with  nose to earth and tail in air.
 As they streamed past the silent forest  around broke suddenly into loud life, with galloping of hoofs, crackling  of brushwood, and the short, sharp cries of the hunters.
 Close behind  the pack rode a fourrier and a yeoman-pricker, whooping on the laggards  and encouraging the leaders, in the shrill half-French jargon which was  the language of venery and woodcraft.
 Alleyne was still gazing  after them, listening to the loud "Hyke-a-Bayard! Hyke-a-Pomers!  Hyke-a-Lebryt!" with which they called upon their favorite hounds, when  a group of horsemen crashed out through the underwood at the very spot  where the serf and he were standing.
    The one who led was a man between fifty and sixty years of age, war-worn  and weather-beaten, with a broad, thoughtful forehead and eyes which  shone brightly from under his fierce and overhung brows.
 His beard,  streaked thickly with gray, bristled forward from his chin, and spoke  of a passionate nature, while the long, finely cut face and firm mouth  marked the leader of men.
 His figure was erect and soldierly, and he  rode his horse with the careless grace of a man whose life had been  spent in the saddle.
 In common garb, his masterful face and flashing  eye would have marked him as one who was born to rule; but now, with his  silken tunic powdered with golden fleurs-de-lis, his velvet mantle lined  with the royal minever, and the lions of England stamped in silver upon  his harness, none could fail to recognize the noble Edward, most warlike  and powerful of all the long line of fighting monarchs who had ruled  the Anglo-Norman race.
 Alleyne doffed hat and bowed head at the sight  of him, but the serf folded his hands and leaned them upon his cudgel,  looking with little love at the knot of nobles and knights-in-waiting  who rode behind the king.
    "Ha!" cried Edward, reining up for an instant his powerful black steed.
  "Le cerf est passe? Non? Ici, Brocas; tu parles Anglais.
"    "The deer, clowns?" said a hard-visaged, swarthy-faced man, who rode at  the king's elbow.
 "If ye have headed it back it is as much as your ears  are worth.
"    "It passed by the blighted beech there," said Alleyne, pointing, "and  the hounds were hard at its heels.
"    "It is well," cried Edward, still speaking in French: for, though he  could understand English, he had never learned to express himself in so  barbarous and unpolished a tongue.
 "By my faith, sirs," he continued,  half turning in his saddle to address his escort, "unless my woodcraft  is sadly at fault, it is a stag of six tines and the finest that we have  roused this journey.
 A golden St.
 Hubert to the man who is the first to  sound the mort.
" He shook his bridle as he spoke, and thundered away,  his knights lying low upon their horses and galloping as hard as whip  and spur would drive them, in the hope of winning the king's prize.
 Away  they drove down the long green glade--bay horses, black and gray, riders  clad in every shade of velvet, fur, or silk, with glint of brazen horn  and flash of knife and spear.
 One only lingered, the black-browed Baron  Brocas, who, making a gambade which brought him within arm-sweep of  the serf, slashed him across the face with his riding-whip.
 "Doff, dog,  doff," he hissed, "when a monarch deigns to lower his eyes to such as  you!"--then spurred through the underwood and was gone, with a gleam of  steel shoes and flutter of dead leaves.
    The villein took the cruel blow without wince or cry, as one to whom  stripes are a birthright and an inheritance.
 His eyes flashed, however,  and he shook his bony hand with a fierce wild gesture after the  retreating figure.
    "Black hound of Gascony," he muttered, "evil the day that you and those  like you set foot in free England! I know thy kennel of Rochecourt.
 The  night will come when I may do to thee and thine what you and your class  have wrought upon mine and me.
 May God smite me if I fail to smite thee,  thou French robber, with thy wife and thy child and all that is under  thy castle roof!"    "Forbear!" cried Alleyne.
 "Mix not God's name with these unhallowed  threats! And yet it was a coward's blow, and one to stir the blood and  loose the tongue of the most peaceful.
 Let me find some soothing simples  and lay them on the weal to draw the sting.
"    "Nay, there is but one thing that can draw the sting, and that the  future may bring to me.
 But, clerk, if you would see your brother you  must on, for there is a meeting to-day, and his merry men will await him  ere the shadows turn from west to east.
 I pray you not to hold him back,  for it would be an evil thing if all the stout lads were there and the  leader a-missing.
 I would come with you, but sooth to say I am stationed  here and may not move.
 The path over yonder, betwixt the oak and the  thorn, should bring you out into his nether field.
"    Alleyne lost no time in following the directions of the wild, masterless  man, whom he left among the trees where he had found him.
 His heart was  the heavier for the encounter, not only because all bitterness and wrath  were abhorrent to his gentle nature, but also because it disturbed him  to hear his brother spoken of as though he were a chief of outlaws or  the leader of a party against the state.
 Indeed, of all the things which  he had seen yet in the world to surprise him there was none more  strange than the hate which class appeared to bear to class.
 The talk  of laborer, woodman and villein in the inn had all pointed to the  wide-spread mutiny, and now his brother's name was spoken as though he  were the very centre of the universal discontent.
 In good truth, the  commons throughout the length and breadth of the land were heart-weary  of this fine game of chivalry which had been played so long at their  expense.
 So long as knight and baron were a strength and a guard to the  kingdom they might be endured, but now, when all men knew that the great  battles in France had been won by English yeomen and Welsh stabbers,  warlike fame, the only fame to which his class had ever aspired,  appeared to have deserted the plate-clad horsemen.
 The sports of the  lists had done much in days gone by to impress the minds of the people,  but the plumed and unwieldy champion was no longer an object either of  fear or of reverence to men whose fathers and brothers had shot into the  press at Crecy or Poitiers, and seen the proudest chivalry in the world  unable to make head against the weapons of disciplined peasants.
 Power  had changed hands.
 The protector had become the protected, and the whole  fabric of the feudal system was tottering to a fall.
 Hence the fierce  mutterings of the lower classes and the constant discontent, breaking  out into local tumult and outrage, and culminating some years later in  the great rising of Tyler.
 What Alleyne saw and wondered at in Hampshire  would have appealed equally to the traveller in any other English county  from the Channel to the marches of Scotland.
    He was following the track, his misgivings increasing with every step  which took him nearer to that home which he had never seen, when of a  sudden the trees began to thin and the sward to spread out onto a broad,  green lawn, where five cows lay in the sunshine and droves of black  swine wandered unchecked.
 A brown forest stream swirled down the centre  of this clearing, with a rude bridge flung across it, and on the other  side was a second field sloping up to a long, low-lying wooden house,  with thatched roof and open squares for windows.
 Alleyne gazed across  at it with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes--for this, he knew, must  be the home of his fathers.
 A wreath of blue smoke floated up through a  hole in the thatch, and was the only sign of life in the place, save a  great black hound which lay sleeping chained to the door-post.
 In the  yellow shimmer of the autumn sunshine it lay as peacefully and as still  as he had oft pictured it to himself in his dreams.
    He was roused, however, from his pleasant reverie by the sound of  voices, and two people emerged from the forest some little way to his  right and moved across the field in the direction of the bridge.
 The one  was a man with yellow flowing beard and very long hair of the same tint  drooping over his shoulders; his dress of good Norwich cloth and his  assured bearing marked him as a man of position, while the sombre hue  of his clothes and the absence of all ornament contrasted with the flash  and glitter which had marked the king's retinue.
 By his side walked  a woman, tall and slight and dark, with lithe, graceful figure and  clear-cut, composed features.
 Her jet-black hair was gathered back under  a light pink coif, her head poised proudly upon her neck, and her step  long and springy, like that of some wild, tireless woodland creature.
  She held her left hand in front of her, covered with a red velvet glove,  and on the wrist a little brown falcon, very fluffy and bedraggled,  which she smoothed and fondled as she walked.
 As she came out into the  sunshine, Alleyne noticed that her light gown, slashed with pink, was  all stained with earth and with moss upon one side from shoulder to hem.
  He stood in the shadow of an oak staring at her with parted lips, for  this woman seemed to him to be the most beautiful and graceful creature  that mind could conceive of.
 Such had he imagined the angels, and such  he had tried to paint them in the Beaulieu missals; but here there was  something human, were it only in the battered hawk and discolored dress,  which sent a tingle and thrill through his nerves such as no dream of  radiant and stainless spirit had ever yet been able to conjure up.
 Good,  quiet, uncomplaining mother Nature, long slighted and miscalled, still  bides her time and draws to her bosom the most errant of her children.
    The two walked swiftly across the meadow to the narrow bridge, he in  front and she a pace or two behind.
 There they paused, and stood for  a few minutes face to face talking earnestly.
 Alleyne had read and  had heard of love and of lovers.
 Such were these, doubtless--this  golden-bearded man and the fair damsel with the cold, proud face.
 Why  else should they wander together in the woods, or be so lost in talk by  rustic streams? And yet as he watched, uncertain whether to advance from  the cover or to choose some other path to the house, he soon came  to doubt the truth of this first conjecture.
 The man stood, tall and  square, blocking the entrance to the bridge, and throwing out his hands  as he spoke in a wild eager fashion, while the deep tones of his stormy  voice rose at times into accents of menace and of anger.
 She stood  fearlessly in front of him, still stroking her bird; but twice she threw  a swift questioning glance over her shoulder, as one who is in search  of aid.
 So moved was the young clerk by these mute appeals, that he came  forth from the trees and crossed the meadow, uncertain what to do, and  yet loth to hold back from one who might need his aid.
 So intent were  they upon each other that neither took note of his approach; until, when  he was close upon them, the man threw his arm roughly round the damsel's  waist and drew her towards him, she straining her lithe, supple figure  away and striking fiercely at him, while the hooded hawk screamed with  ruffled wings and pecked blindly in its mistress's defence.
 Bird and  maid, however, had but little chance against their assailant who,  laughing loudly, caught her wrist in one hand while he drew her towards  him with the other.
    "The best rose has ever the longest thorns," said he.
 "Quiet, little  one, or you may do yourself a hurt.
 Must pay Saxon toll on Saxon land,  my proud Maude, for all your airs and graces.
"    "You boor!" she hissed.
 "You base underbred clod! Is this your care and  your hospitality? I would rather wed a branded serf from my father's  fields.
 Leave go, I say----Ah! good youth, Heaven has sent you.
 Make him  loose me! By the honor of your mother, I pray you to stand by me and to  make this knave loose me.
"    "Stand by you I will, and that blithely," said Alleyne.
 "Surely, sir,  you should take shame to hold the damsel against her will.
"    The man turned a face upon him which was lion-like in its strength and  in its wrath.
 With his tangle of golden hair, his fierce blue eyes, and  his large, well-marked features, he was the most comely man whom Alleyne  had ever seen, and yet there was something so sinister and so fell in  his expression that child or beast might well have shrunk from him.
 His  brows were drawn, his cheek flushed, and there was a mad sparkle in his  eyes which spoke of a wild, untamable nature.
    "Young fool!" he cried, holding the woman still to his side, though  every line of her shrinking figure spoke her abhorrence.
 "Do you keep  your spoon in your own broth.
 I rede you to go on your way, lest worse  befall you.
 This little wench has come with me and with me she shall  bide.
"    "Liar!" cried the woman; and, stooping her head, she suddenly bit  fiercely into the broad brown hand which held her.
 He whipped it back  with an oath, while she tore herself free and slipped behind Alleyne,  cowering up against him like the trembling leveret who sees the falcon  poising for the swoop above him.
    "Stand off my land!" the man said fiercely, heedless of the blood which  trickled freely from his fingers.
 "What have you to do here? By your  dress you should be one of those cursed clerks who overrun the land like  vile rats, poking and prying into other men's concerns, too caitiff to  fight and too lazy to work.
 By the rood! if I had my will upon ye, I  should nail you upon the abbey doors, as they hang vermin before their  holes.
 Art neither man nor woman, young shaveling.
 Get thee back to thy  fellows ere I lay hands upon you: for your foot is on my land, and I may  slay you as a common draw-latch.
"    "Is this your land, then?" gasped Alleyne.
    "Would you dispute it, dog? Would you wish by trick or quibble to juggle  me out of these last acres? Know, base-born knave, that you have dared  this day to stand in the path of one whose race have been the advisers  of kings and the leaders of hosts, ere ever this vile crew of Norman  robbers came into the land, or such half-blood hounds as you were let  loose to preach that the thief should have his booty and the honest man  should sin if he strove to win back his own.
"    "You are the Socman of Minstead?"    "That am I; and the son of Edric the Socman, of the pure blood of  Godfrey the thane, by the only daughter of the house of Aluric, whose  forefathers held the white-horse banner at the fatal fight where our  shield was broken and our sword shivered.
 I tell you, clerk, that my  folk held this land from Bramshaw Wood to the Ringwood road; and, by the  soul of my father! it will be a strange thing if I am to be bearded upon  the little that is left of it.
 Begone, I say, and meddle not with my  affair.
"    "If you leave me now," whispered the woman, "then shame forever upon  your manhood.
"    "Surely, sir," said Alleyne, speaking in as persuasive and soothing a  way as he could, "if your birth is gentle, there is the more reason that  your manners should be gentle too.
 I am well persuaded that you did but  jest with this lady, and that you will now permit her to leave your land  either alone or with me as a guide, if she should need one, through the  wood.
 As to birth, it does not become me to boast, and there is sooth in  what you say as to the unworthiness of clerks, but it is none the less  true that I am as well born as you.
"    "Dog!" cried the furious Socman, "there is no man in the south who can  say as much.
"    "Yet can I," said Alleyne smiling; "for indeed I also am the son of  Edric the Socman, of the pure blood of Godfrey the thane, by the only  daughter of Aluric of Brockenhurst.
 Surely, dear brother," he continued,  holding out his hand, "you have a warmer greeting than this for me.
  There are but two boughs left upon this old, old Saxon trunk.
"    His elder brother dashed his hand aside with an oath, while an  expression of malignant hatred passed over his passion-drawn features.
  "You are the young cub of Beaulieu, then," said he.
 "I might have known  it by the sleek face and the slavish manner too monk-ridden and craven  in spirit to answer back a rough word.
 Thy father, shaveling, with all  his faults, had a man's heart; and there were few who could look him in  the eyes on the day of his anger.
 But you! Look there, rat, on yonder  field where the cows graze, and on that other beyond, and on the orchard  hard by the church.
 Do you know that all these were squeezed out of  your dying father by greedy priests, to pay for your upbringing in the  cloisters? I, the Socman, am shorn of my lands that you may snivel Latin  and eat bread for which you never did hand's turn.
 You rob me first, and  now you would come preaching and whining, in search mayhap of another  field or two for your priestly friends.
 Knave! my dogs shall be set upon  you; but, meanwhile, stand out of my path, and stop me at your peril!"  As he spoke he rushed forward, and, throwing the lad to one side, caught  the woman's wrist.
 Alleyne, however, as active as a young deer-hound,  sprang to her aid and seized her by the other arm, raising his iron-shod  staff as he did so.
    "You may say what you will to me," he said between his clenched  teeth--"it may be no better than I deserve; but, brother or no, I swear  by my hopes of salvation that I will break your arm if you do not leave  hold of the maid.
"    There was a ring in his voice and a flash in his eyes which promised  that the blow would follow quick at the heels of the word.
 For a moment  the blood of the long line of hot-headed thanes was too strong for the  soft whisperings of the doctrine of meekness and mercy.
 He was conscious  of a fierce wild thrill through his nerves and a throb of mad gladness  at his heart, as his real human self burst for an instant the bonds  of custom and of teaching which had held it so long.
 The socman sprang  back, looking to left and to right for some stick or stone which might  serve him for weapon; but finding none, he turned and ran at the top of  his speed for the house, blowing the while upon a shrill whistle.
    "Come!" gasped the woman.
 "Fly, friend, ere he come back.
"    "Nay, let him come!" cried Alleyne.
 "I shall not budge a foot for him or  his dogs.
"    "Come, come!" she cried, tugging at his arm.
 "I know the man: he will  kill you.
 Come, for the Virgin's sake, or for my sake, for I cannot go  and leave you here.
"    "Come, then," said he; and they ran together to the cover of the woods.
  As they gained the edge of the brushwood, Alleyne, looking back, saw his  brother come running out of the house again, with the sun gleaming upon  his hair and his beard.
 He held something which flashed in his right  hand, and he stooped at the threshold to unloose the black hound.
    "This way!" the woman whispered, in a low eager voice.
 "Through the  bushes to that forked ash.
 Do not heed me; I can run as fast as you, I  trow.
 Now into the stream--right in, over ankles, to throw the dog off,  though I think it is but a common cur, like its master.
" As she spoke,  she sprang herself into the shallow stream and ran swiftly up the  centre of it, with the brown water bubbling over her feet and her  hand out-stretched toward the clinging branches of bramble or sapling.
  Alleyne followed close at her heels, with his mind in a whirl at this  black welcome and sudden shifting of all his plans and hopes.
 Yet, grave  as were his thoughts, they would still turn to wonder as he looked at  the twinkling feet of his guide and saw her lithe figure bend this way  and that, dipping under boughs, springing over stones, with a lightness  and ease which made it no small task for him to keep up with her.
 At  last, when he was almost out of breath, she suddenly threw herself down  upon a mossy bank, between two holly-bushes, and looked ruefully at her  own dripping feet and bedraggled skirt.
    "Holy Mary!" said she, "what shall I do? Mother will keep me to my  chamber for a month, and make me work at the tapestry of the nine bold  knights.
 She promised as much last week, when I fell into Wilverley bog,  and yet she knows that I cannot abide needle-work.
"    Alleyne, still standing in the stream, glanced down at the graceful  pink-and-white figure, the curve of raven-black hair, and the proud,  sensitive face which looked up frankly and confidingly at his own.
    "We had best on," he said.
 "He may yet overtake us.
"    "Not so.
 We are well off his land now, nor can he tell in this great  wood which way we have taken.
 But you--you had him at your mercy.
 Why  did you not kill him?"    "Kill him! My brother!"    "And why not?"--with a quick gleam of her white teeth.
 "He would have  killed you.
 I know him, and I read it in his eyes.
 Had I had your staff  I would have tried--aye, and done it, too.
" She shook her clenched white  hand as she spoke, and her lips tightened ominously.
    "I am already sad in heart for what I have done," said he, sitting down  on the bank, and sinking his face into his hands.
 "God help me!--all  that is worst in me seemed to come uppermost.
 Another instant, and I  had smitten him: the son of my own mother, the man whom I have longed to  take to my heart.
 Alas! that I should still be so weak.
"    "Weak!" she exclaimed, raising her black eyebrows.
 "I do not think that  even my father himself, who is a hard judge of manhood, would call you  that.
 But it is, as you may think, sir, a very pleasant thing for me to  hear that you are grieved at what you have done, and I can but rede  that we should go back together, and you should make your peace with the  Socman by handing back your prisoner.
 It is a sad thing that so small a  thing as a woman should come between two who are of one blood.
"    Simple Alleyne opened his eyes at this little spurt of feminine  bitterness.
 "Nay, lady," said he, "that were worst of all.
 What man  would be so caitiff and thrall as to fail you at your need? I have  turned my brother against me, and now, alas! I appear to have given you  offence also with my clumsy tongue.
 But, indeed, lady, I am torn both  ways, and can scarce grasp in my mind what it is that has befallen.
"    "Nor can I marvel at that," said she, with a little tinkling laugh.
 "You  came in as the knight does in the jongleur's romances, between dragon  and damsel, with small time for the asking of questions.
 Come," she went  on, springing to her feet, and smoothing down her rumpled frock, "let us  walk through the shaw together, and we may come upon Bertrand with the  horses.
 If poor Troubadour had not cast a shoe, we should not have had  this trouble.
 Nay, I must have your arm: for, though I speak lightly,  now that all is happily over I am as frightened as my brave Roland.
 See  how his chest heaves, and his dear feathers all awry--the little knight  who would not have his lady mishandled.
" So she prattled on to her hawk,  while Alleyne walked by her side, stealing a glance from time to time at  this queenly and wayward woman.
 In silence they wandered together over  the velvet turf and on through the broad Minstead woods, where the  old lichen-draped beeches threw their circles of black shadow upon the  sunlit sward.
    "You have no wish, then, to hear my story?" said she, at last.
    "If it pleases you to tell it me," he answered.
    "Oh!" she cried tossing her head, "if it is of so little interest to  you, we had best let it bide.
"    "Nay," said he eagerly, "I would fain hear it.
"    "You have a right to know it, if you have lost a brother's favor through  it.
 And yet----Ah well, you are, as I understand, a clerk, so I  must think of you as one step further in orders, and make you my  father-confessor.
 Know then that this man has been a suitor for my hand,  less as I think for my own sweet sake than because he hath ambition and  had it on his mind that he might improve his fortunes by dipping into  my father's strong box--though the Virgin knows that he would have found  little enough therein.
 My father, however, is a proud man, a gallant  knight and tried soldier of the oldest blood, to whom this man's  churlish birth and low descent----Oh, lackaday! I had forgot that he was  of the same strain as yourself.
"    "Nay, trouble not for that," said Alleyne, "we are all from good mother  Eve.
"    "Streams may spring from one source, and yet some be clear and some be  foul," quoth she quickly.
 "But, to be brief over the matter, my father  would have none of his wooing, nor in sooth would I.
 On that he swore  a vow against us, and as he is known to be a perilous man, with many  outlaws and others at his back, my father forbade that I should hawk or  hunt in any part of the wood to the north of the Christchurch road.
 As  it chanced, however, this morning my little Roland here was loosed at a  strong-winged heron, and page Bertrand and I rode on, with no thoughts  but for the sport, until we found ourselves in Minstead woods.
 Small  harm then, but that my horse Troubadour trod with a tender foot upon a  sharp stick, rearing and throwing me to the ground.
 See to my gown, the  third that I have befouled within the week.
 Woe worth me when Agatha the  tire-woman sets eyes upon it!"    "And what then, lady?" asked Alleyne.
    "Why, then away ran Troubadour, for belike I spurred him in falling,  and Bertrand rode after him as hard as hoofs could bear him.
 When I rose  there was the Socman himself by my side, with the news that I was on  his land, but with so many courteous words besides, and such gallant  bearing, that he prevailed upon me to come to his house for shelter,  there to wait until the page return.
 By the grace of the Virgin and the  help of my patron St.
 Magdalen, I stopped short ere I reached his  door, though, as you saw, he strove to hale me up to it.
 And  then--ah-h-h-h!"--she shivered and chattered like one in an ague-fit.
    "What is it?" cried Alleyne, looking about in alarm.
    "Nothing, friend, nothing! I was but thinking how I bit into his hand.
  Sooner would I bite living toad or poisoned snake.
 Oh, I shall loathe my  lips forever! But you--how brave you were, and how quick! How meek for  yourself, and how bold for a stranger! If I were a man, I should wish to  do what you have done.
"    "It was a small thing," he answered, with a tingle of pleasure at these  sweet words of praise.
 "But you--what will you do?"    "There is a great oak near here, and I think that Bertrand will bring  the horses there, for it is an old hunting-tryst of ours.
 Then hey for  home, and no more hawking to-day! A twelve-mile gallop will dry feet and  skirt.
"    "But your father?"    "Not one word shall I tell him.
 You do not know him; but I can tell you  he is not a man to disobey as I have disobeyed him.
 He would avenge me,  it is true, but it is not to him that I shall look for vengeance.
 Some  day, perchance, in joust or in tourney, knight may wish to wear my  colors, and then I shall tell him that if he does indeed crave my favor  there is wrong unredressed, and the wronger the Socman of Minstead.
 So  my knight shall find a venture such as bold knights love, and my debt  shall be paid, and my father none the wiser, and one rogue the less in  the world.
 Say, is not that a brave plan?"    "Nay, lady, it is a thought which is unworthy of you.
 How can such as  you speak of violence and of vengeance.
 Are none to be gentle and kind,  none to be piteous and forgiving? Alas! it is a hard, cruel world, and I  would that I had never left my abbey cell.
 To hear such words from your  lips is as though I heard an angel of grace preaching the devil's own  creed.
"    She started from him as a young colt who first feels the bit.
 "Gramercy  for your rede, young sir!" she said, with a little curtsey.
 "As I  understand your words, you are grieved that you ever met me, and look  upon me as a preaching devil.
 Why, my father is a bitter man when he is  wroth, but hath never called me such a name as that.
 It may be his right  and duty, but certes it is none of thine.
 So it would be best, since you  think so lowly of me, that you should take this path to the left while  I keep on upon this one; for it is clear that I can be no fit companion  for you.
" So saying, with downcast lids and a dignity which was somewhat  marred by her bedraggled skirt, she swept off down the muddy track,  leaving Alleyne standing staring ruefully after her.
 He waited in vain  for some backward glance or sign of relenting, but she walked on with  a rigid neck until her dress was only a white flutter among the leaves.
  Then, with a sunken head and a heavy heart, he plodded wearily down the  other path, wroth with himself for the rude and uncouth tongue which had  given offence where so little was intended.
    He had gone some way, lost in doubt and in self-reproach, his mind all  tremulous with a thousand new-found thoughts and fears and wonderments,  when of a sudden there was a light rustle of the leaves behind him, and,  glancing round, there was this graceful, swift-footed creature, treading  in his very shadow, with her proud head bowed, even as his was--the  picture of humility and repentance.
    "I shall not vex you, nor even speak," she said; "but I would fain keep  with you while we are in the wood.
"    "Nay, you cannot vex me," he answered, all warm again at the very sight  of her.
 "It was my rough words which vexed you; but I have been thrown  among men all my life, and indeed, with all the will, I scarce know how  to temper my speech to a lady's ear.
"    "Then unsay it," cried she quickly; "say that I was right to wish to  have vengeance on the Socman.
"    "Nay, I cannot do that," he answered gravely.
    "Then who is ungentle and unkind now?" she cried in triumph.
 "How stern  and cold you are for one so young! Art surely no mere clerk, but bishop  or cardinal at the least.
 Shouldst have crozier for staff and mitre  for cap.
 Well, well, for your sake I will forgive the Socman and take  vengeance on none but on my own wilful self who must needs run into  danger's path.
 So will that please you, sir?"    "There spoke your true self," said he; "and you will find more pleasure  in such forgiveness than in any vengeance.
"    She shook her head, as if by no means assured of it, and then with a  sudden little cry, which had more of surprise than of joy in it, "Here  is Bertrand with the horses!"    Down the glade there came a little green-clad page with laughing eyes,  and long curls floating behind him.
 He sat perched on a high bay horse,  and held on to the bridle of a spirited black palfrey, the hides of both  glistening from a long run.
    "I have sought you everywhere, dear Lady Maude," said he in a  piping voice, springing down from his horse and holding the stirrup.
  "Troubadour galloped as far as Holmhill ere I could catch him.
 I trust  that you have had no hurt or scath?" He shot a questioning glance at  Alleyne as he spoke.
    "No, Bertrand," said she, "thanks to this courteous stranger.
 And now,  sir," she continued, springing into her saddle, "it is not fit that I  leave you without a word more.
 Clerk or no, you have acted this day as  becomes a true knight.
 King Arthur and all his table could not have done  more.
 It may be that, as some small return, my father or his kin may  have power to advance your interest.
 He is not rich, but he is honored  and hath great friends.
 Tell me what is your purpose, and see if he may  not aid it.
"    "Alas! lady, I have now no purpose.
 I have but two friends in the world,  and they have gone to Christchurch, where it is likely I shall join  them.
"    "And where is Christchurch?"    "At the castle which is held by the brave knight, Sir Nigel Loring,  constable to the Earl of Salisbury.
"    To his surprise she burst out a-laughing, and, spurring her palfrey,  dashed off down the glade, with her page riding behind her.
 Not one word  did she say, but as she vanished amid the trees she half turned in her  saddle and waved a last greeting.
 Long time he stood, half hoping that  she might again come back to him; but the thud of the hoofs had died  away, and there was no sound in all the woods but the gentle rustle and  dropping of the leaves.
 At last he turned away and made his way back to  the high-road--another person from the light-hearted boy who had left it  a short three hours before.
        .
 HOW HORDLE JOHN FOUND A MAN WHOM HE MIGHT FOLLOW.
      If he might not return to Beaulieu within the year, and if his brother's  dogs were to be set upon him if he showed face upon Minstead land, then  indeed he was adrift upon earth.
 North, south, east, and west--he might  turn where he would, but all was equally chill and cheerless.
 The Abbot  had rolled ten silver crowns in a lettuce-leaf and hid them away in the  bottom of his scrip, but that would be a sorry support for twelve long  months.
 In all the darkness there was but the one bright spot of the  sturdy comrades whom he had left that morning; if he could find them  again all would be well.
 The afternoon was not very advanced, for all  that had befallen him.
 When a man is afoot at cock-crow much may be done  in the day.
 If he walked fast he might yet overtake his friends ere they  reached their destination.
 He pushed on therefore, now walking and now  running.
 As he journeyed he bit into a crust which remained from his  Beaulieu bread, and he washed it down by a draught from a woodland  stream.
    It was no easy or light thing to journey through this great forest,  which was some twenty miles from east to west and a good sixteen from  Bramshaw Woods in the north to Lymington in the south.
 Alleyne, however,  had the good fortune to fall in with a woodman, axe upon shoulder,  trudging along in the very direction that he wished to go.
 With his  guidance he passed the fringe of Bolderwood Walk, famous for old ash  and yew, through Mark Ash with its giant beech-trees, and on through  the Knightwood groves, where the giant oak was already a great tree,  but only one of many comely brothers.
 They plodded along together, the  woodman and Alleyne, with little talk on either side, for their thoughts  were as far asunder as the poles.
 The peasant's gossip had been of the  hunt, of the bracken, of the gray-headed kites that had nested in Wood  Fidley, and of the great catch of herring brought back by the boats of  Pitt's Deep.
 The clerk's mind was on his brother, on his future--above  all on this strange, fierce, melting, beautiful woman who had broken  so suddenly into his life, and as suddenly passed out of it again.
 So  _distrait_ was he and so random his answers, that the woodman took  to whistling, and soon branched off upon the track to Burley, leaving  Alleyne upon the main Christchurch road.
    Down this he pushed as fast as he might, hoping at every turn and rise  to catch sight of his companions of the morning.
 From Vinney Ridge to  Rhinefield Walk the woods grow thick and dense up to the very edges of  the track, but beyond the country opens up into broad dun-colored moors,  flecked with clumps of trees, and topping each other in long, low curves  up to the dark lines of forest in the furthest distance.
 Clouds of  insects danced and buzzed in the golden autumn light, and the air was  full of the piping of the song-birds.
 Long, glinting dragonflies shot  across the path, or hung tremulous with gauzy wings and gleaming bodies.
  Once a white-necked sea eagle soared screaming high over the traveller's  head, and again a flock of brown bustards popped up from among the  bracken, and blundered away in their clumsy fashion, half running, half  flying, with strident cry and whirr of wings.
    There were folk, too, to be met upon the road--beggars and couriers,  chapmen and tinkers--cheery fellows for the most part, with a rough jest  and homely greeting for each other and for Alleyne.
 Near Shotwood he  came upon five seamen, on their way from Poole to Southampton--rude  red-faced men, who shouted at him in a jargon which he could scarce  understand, and held out to him a great pot from which they had been  drinking--nor would they let him pass until he had dipped pannikin in  and taken a mouthful, which set him coughing and choking, with the tears  running down his cheeks.
 Further on he met a sturdy black-bearded man,  mounted on a brown horse, with a rosary in his right hand and a long  two-handed sword jangling against his stirrup-iron.
 By his black robe  and the eight-pointed cross upon his sleeve, Alleyne recognized him  as one of the Knights Hospitallers of St.
 John of Jerusalem, whose  presbytery was at Baddesley.
 He held up two fingers as he passed, with a  "_Benedic, fili mi!_" whereat Alleyne doffed hat and bent knee, looking  with much reverence at one who had devoted his life to the overthrow of  the infidel.
 Poor simple lad! he had not learned yet that what men are  and what men profess to be are very wide asunder, and that the Knights  of St.
 John, having come into large part of the riches of the ill-fated  Templars, were very much too comfortable to think of exchanging their  palace for a tent, or the cellars of England for the thirsty deserts of  Syria.
 Yet ignorance may be more precious than wisdom, for Alleyne as he  walked on braced himself to a higher life by the thought of this other's  sacrifice, and strengthened himself by his example which he could scarce  have done had he known that the Hospitaller's mind ran more upon malmsey  than on Mamelukes, and on venison rather than victories.
    As he pressed on the plain turned to woods once more in the region of  Wilverley Walk, and a cloud swept up from the south with the sun shining  through the chinks of it.
 A few great drops came pattering loudly  down, and then in a moment the steady swish of a brisk shower, with  the dripping and dropping of the leaves.
 Alleyne, glancing round for  shelter, saw a thick and lofty holly-bush, so hollowed out beneath that  no house could have been drier.
 Under this canopy of green two men were  already squatted, who waved their hands to Alleyne that he should join  them.
 As he approached he saw that they had five dried herrings laid  out in front of them, with a great hunch of wheaten bread and a leathern  flask full of milk, but instead of setting to at their food they  appeared to have forgot all about it, and were disputing together with  flushed faces and angry gestures.
 It was easy to see by their dress and  manner that they were two of those wandering students who formed about  this time so enormous a multitude in every country in Europe.
 The one  was long and thin, with melancholy features, while the other was fat and  sleek, with a loud voice and the air of a man who is not to be gainsaid.
    "Come hither, good youth," he cried, "come hither! _Vultus ingenui  puer_.
 Heed not the face of my good coz here.
 _Foenum habet in cornu_,  as Don Horace has it; but I warrant him harmless for all that.
"    "Stint your bull's bellowing!" exclaimed the other.
 "If it come to  Horace, I have a line in my mind: _Loquaces si sapiat_----How doth it  run? The English o't being that a man of sense should ever avoid a great  talker.
 That being so, if all were men of sense then thou wouldst be a  lonesome man, coz.
"    "Alas! Dicon, I fear that your logic is as bad as your philosophy or  your divinity--and God wot it would be hard to say a worse word than  that for it.
 For, hark ye: granting, _propter argumentum_, that I am a  talker, then the true reasoning runs that since all men of sense should  avoid me, and thou hast not avoided me, but art at the present moment  eating herrings with me under a holly-bush, ergo you are no man of  sense, which is exactly what I have been dinning into your long ears  ever since I first clapped eyes on your sunken chops.
"    "Tut, tut!" cried the other.
 "Your tongue goes like the clapper of  a mill-wheel.
 Sit down here, friend, and partake of this herring.
  Understand first, however, that there are certain conditions attached to  it.
"    "I had hoped," said Alleyne, falling into the humor of the twain, "that  a tranchoir of bread and a draught of milk might be attached to it.
"    "Hark to him, hark to him!" cried the little fat man.
 "It is even thus,  Dicon! Wit, lad, is a catching thing, like the itch or the sweating  sickness.
 I exude it round me; it is an aura.
 I tell you, coz, that no  man can come within seventeen feet of me without catching a spark.
 Look  at your own case.
 A duller man never stepped, and yet within the week  you have said three things which might pass, and one thing the day we  left Fordingbridge which I should not have been ashamed of myself.
"    "Enough, rattle-pate, enough!" said the other.
 "The milk you shall have  and the bread also, friend, together with the herring, but you must hold  the scales between us.
"    "If he hold the herring he holds the scales, my sapient brother," cried  the fat man.
 "But I pray you, good youth, to tell us whether you are a  learned clerk, and, if so, whether you have studied at Oxenford or at  Paris.
"    "I have some small stock of learning," Alleyne answered, picking at his  herring, "but I have been at neither of these places.
 I was bred amongst  the Cistercian monks at Beaulieu Abbey.
"    "Pooh, pooh!" they cried both together.
 "What sort of an upbringing is  that?"    "_Non cuivis contingit adire Corinthum_," quoth Alleyne.
    "Come, brother Stephen, he hath some tincture of letters," said the  melancholy man more hopefully.
 "He may be the better judge, since he  hath no call to side with either of us.
 Now, attention, friend, and let  your ears work as well as your nether jaw.
 _Judex damnatur_--you know  the old saw.
 Here am I upholding the good fame of the learned Duns  Scotus against the foolish quibblings and poor silly reasonings of  Willie Ockham.
"    "While I," quoth the other loudly, "do maintain the good sense  and extraordinary wisdom of that most learned William against the  crack-brained fantasies of the muddy Scotchman, who hath hid such little  wit as he has under so vast a pile of words, that it is like one drop of  Gascony in a firkin of ditch-water.
 Solomon his wisdom would not suffice  to say what the rogue means.
"    "Certes, Stephen Hapgood, his wisdom doth not suffice," cried the other.
  "It is as though a mole cried out against the morning star, because he  could not see it.
 But our dispute, friend, is concerning the nature of  that subtle essence which we call thought.
 For I hold with the learned  Scotus that thought is in very truth a thing, even as vapor or fumes,  or many other substances which our gross bodily eyes are blind to.
 For,  look you, that which produces a thing must be itself a thing, and if a  man's thought may produce a written book, then must thought itself be a  material thing, even as the book is.
 Have I expressed it? Do I make it  plain?"    "Whereas I hold," shouted the other, "with my revered preceptor,  _doctor, praeclarus et excellentissimus_, that all things are but  thought; for when thought is gone I prythee where are the things then?  Here are trees about us, and I see them because I think I see them, but  if I have swooned, or sleep, or am in wine, then, my thought having gone  forth from me, lo the trees go forth also.
 How now, coz, have I touched  thee on the raw?"    Alleyne sat between them munching his bread, while the twain disputed  across his knees, leaning forward with flushed faces and darting  hands, in all the heat of argument.
 Never had he heard such jargon of  scholastic philosophy, such fine-drawn distinctions, such cross-fire of  major and minor, proposition, syllogism, attack and refutation.
 Question  clattered upon answer like a sword on a buckler.
 The ancients, the  fathers of the Church, the moderns, the Scriptures, the Arabians, were  each sent hurtling against the other, while the rain still dripped and  the dark holly-leaves glistened with the moisture.
 At last the fat man  seemed to weary of it, for he set to work quietly upon his meal, while  his opponent, as proud as the rooster who is left unchallenged upon the  midden, crowed away in a last long burst of quotation and deduction.
  Suddenly, however, his eyes dropped upon his food, and he gave a howl of  dismay.
    "You double thief!" he cried, "you have eaten my herrings, and I without  bite or sup since morning.
"    "That," quoth the other complacently, "was my final argument, my  crowning effort, or _peroratio_, as the orators have it.
 For, coz, since  all thoughts are things, you have but to think a pair of herrings, and  then conjure up a pottle of milk wherewith to wash them down.
"    "A brave piece of reasoning," cried the other, "and I know of but one  reply to it.
" On which, leaning forward, he caught his comrade a rousing  smack across his rosy cheek.
 "Nay, take it not amiss," he said, "since  all things are but thoughts, then that also is but a thought and may be  disregarded.
"    This last argument, however, by no means commended itself to the pupil  of Ockham, who plucked a great stick from the ground and signified his  dissent by smiting the realist over the pate with it.
 By good fortune,  the wood was so light and rotten that it went to a thousand splinters,  but Alleyne thought it best to leave the twain to settle the matter at  their leisure, the more so as the sun was shining brightly once  more.
 Looking back down the pool-strewn road, he saw the two excited  philosophers waving their hands and shouting at each other, but their  babble soon became a mere drone in the distance, and a turn in the road  hid them from his sight.
    And now after passing Holmesley Walk and the Wooton Heath, the forest  began to shred out into scattered belts of trees, with gleam of  corn-field and stretch of pasture-land between.
 Here and there by the  wayside stood little knots of wattle-and-daub huts with shock-haired  laborers lounging by the doors and red-cheeked children sprawling in  the roadway.
 Back among the groves he could see the high gable ends and  thatched roofs of the franklins' houses, on whose fields these men found  employment, or more often a thick dark column of smoke marked their  position and hinted at the coarse plenty within.
 By these signs Alleyne  knew that he was on the very fringe of the forest, and therefore no  great way from Christchurch.
 The sun was lying low in the west and  shooting its level rays across the long sweep of rich green country,  glinting on the white-fleeced sheep and throwing long shadows from the  red kine who waded knee-deep in the juicy clover.
 Right glad was the  traveller to see the high tower of Christchurch Priory gleaming in the  mellow evening light, and gladder still when, on rounding a corner, he  came upon his comrades of the morning seated astraddle upon a fallen  tree.
 They had a flat space before them, on which they alternately threw  little square pieces of bone, and were so intent upon their occupation  that they never raised eye as he approached them.
 He observed with  astonishment, as he drew near, that the archer's bow was on John's  back, the archer's sword by John's side, and the steel cap laid upon the  tree-trunk between them.
    "Mort de ma vie!" Aylward shouted, looking down at the dice.
 "Never had  I such cursed luck.
 A murrain on the bones! I have not thrown a good  main since I left Navarre.
 A one and a three! En avant, camarade!"    "Four and three," cried Hordle John, counting on his great fingers,  "that makes seven.
 Ho, archer, I have thy cap! Now have at thee for thy  jerkin!"    "Mon Dieu!" he growled, "I am like to reach Christchurch in my shirt.
"  Then suddenly glancing up, "Hola, by the splendor of heaven, here is our  cher petit! Now, by my ten finger bones! this is a rare sight to mine  eyes.
" He sprang up and threw his arms round Alleyne's neck, while  John, no less pleased, but more backward and Saxon in his habits, stood  grinning and bobbing by the wayside, with his newly won steel cap stuck  wrong side foremost upon his tangle of red hair.
    "Hast come to stop?" cried the bowman, patting Alleyne all over in his  delight.
 "Shall not get away from us again!"    "I wish no better," said he, with a pringling in the eyes at this hearty  greeting.
    "Well said, lad!" cried big John.
 "We three shall to the wars together,  and the devil may fly away with the Abbot of Beaulieu! But your feet  and hosen are all besmudged.
 Hast been in the water, or I am the more  mistaken.
"    "I have in good sooth," Alleyne answered, and then as they journeyed  on their way he told them the many things that had befallen him, his  meeting with the villein, his sight of the king, his coming upon his  brother, with all the tale of the black welcome and of the fair damsel.
  They strode on either side, each with an ear slanting towards him, but  ere he had come to the end of his story the bowman had spun round upon  his heel, and was hastening back the way they had come, breathing loudly  through his nose.
    "What then?" asked Alleyne, trotting after him and gripping at his  jerkin.
    "I am back for Minstead, lad.
"    "And why, in the name of sense?"    "To thrust a handful of steel into the Socman.
 What! hale a demoiselle  against her will, and then loose dogs at his own brother! Let me go!"    "Nenny, nenny!" cried Alleyne, laughing.
 "There was no scath done.
 Come  back, friend"--and so, by mingled pushing and entreaties, they got his  head round for Christchurch once more.
 Yet he walked with his chin upon  his shoulder, until, catching sight of a maiden by a wayside well, the  smiles came back to his face and peace to his heart.
    "But you," said Alleyne, "there have been changes with you also.
 Why  should not the workman carry his tools? Where are bow and sword and  cap--and why so warlike, John?"    "It is a game which friend Aylward hath been a-teaching of me.
"    "And I found him an over-apt pupil," grumbled the bowman.
 "He hath  stripped me as though I had fallen into the hands of the tardvenus.
 But,  by my hilt! you must render them back to me, camarade, lest you bring  discredit upon my mission, and I will pay you for them at armorers'  prices.
"    "Take them back, man, and never heed the pay," said John.
 "I did but  wish to learn the feel of them, since I am like to have such trinkets  hung to my own girdle for some years to come.
"    "Ma foi, he was born for a free companion!" cried Aylward, "He hath the  very trick of speech and turn of thought.
 I take them back then, and  indeed it gives me unease not to feel my yew-stave tapping against my  leg bone.
 But see, mes garcons, on this side of the church rises the  square and darkling tower of Earl Salisbury's castle, and even from here  I seem to see on yonder banner the red roebuck of the Montacutes.
"    "Red upon white," said Alleyne, shading his eyes; "but whether roebuck  or no is more than I could vouch.
 How black is the great tower, and  how bright the gleam of arms upon the wall! See below the flag, how it  twinkles like a star!"    "Aye, it is the steel head-piece of the watchman," remarked the archer.
  "But we must on, if we are to be there before the drawbridge rises at  the vespers bugle; for it is likely that Sir Nigel, being so renowned a  soldier, may keep hard discipline within the walls, and let no man enter  after sundown.
" So saying, he quickened his pace, and the three comrades  were soon close to the straggling and broad-spread town which centered  round the noble church and the frowning castle.
    It chanced on that very evening that Sir Nigel Loring, having supped  before sunset, as was his custom, and having himself seen that Pommers  and Cadsand, his two war-horses, with the thirteen hacks, the five  jennets, my lady's three palfreys, and the great dapple-gray roussin,  had all their needs supplied, had taken his dogs for an evening  breather.
 Sixty or seventy of them, large and small, smooth and  shaggy--deer-hound, boar-hound, blood-hound, wolf-hound, mastiff, alaun,  talbot, lurcher, terrier, spaniel--snapping, yelling and whining, with  score of lolling tongues and waving tails, came surging down the narrow  lane which leads from the Twynham kennels to the bank of Avon.
 Two  russet-clad varlets, with loud halloo and cracking whips, walked  thigh-deep amid the swarm, guiding, controlling, and urging.
 Behind  came Sir Nigel himself, with Lady Loring upon his arm, the pair walking  slowly and sedately, as befitted both their age and their condition,  while they watched with a smile in their eyes the scrambling crowd in  front of them.
 They paused, however, at the bridge, and, leaning their  elbows upon the stonework, they stood looking down at their own faces in  the glassy stream, and at the swift flash of speckled trout against the  tawny gravel.
    Sir Nigel was a slight man of poor stature, with soft lisping voice and  gentle ways.
 So short was he that his wife, who was no very tall woman,  had the better of him by the breadth of three fingers.
 His sight having  been injured in his early wars by a basketful of lime which had been  emptied over him when he led the Earl of Derby's stormers up the breach  at Bergerac, he had contracted something of a stoop, with a blinking,  peering expression of face.
 His age was six and forty, but the constant  practice of arms, together with a cleanly life, had preserved his  activity and endurance unimpaired, so that from a distance he seemed to  have the slight limbs and swift grace of a boy.
 His face, however, was  tanned of a dull yellow tint, with a leathery, poreless look, which  spoke of rough outdoor doings, and the little pointed beard which he  wore, in deference to the prevailing fashion, was streaked and shot with  gray.
 His features were small, delicate, and regular, with clear-cut,  curving nose, and eyes which jutted forward from the lids.
 His dress was  simple and yet spruce.
 A Flandrish hat of beevor, bearing in the band  the token of Our Lady of Embrun, was drawn low upon the left side to  hide that ear which had been partly shorn from his head by a Flemish  man-at-arms in a camp broil before Tournay.
 His cote-hardie, or tunic,  and trunk-hosen were of a purple plum color, with long weepers which  hung from either sleeve to below his knees.
 His shoes were of red  leather, daintily pointed at the toes, but not yet prolonged to the  extravagant lengths which the succeeding reign was to bring into  fashion.
 A gold-embroidered belt of knighthood encircled his loins, with  his arms, five roses gules on a field argent, cunningly worked upon the  clasp.
 So stood Sir Nigel Loring upon the bridge of Avon, and talked  lightly with his lady.
    And, certes, had the two visages alone been seen, and the stranger been  asked which were the more likely to belong to the bold warrior whose  name was loved by the roughest soldiery of Europe, he had assuredly  selected the lady's.
 Her face was large and square and red, with fierce,  thick brows, and the eyes of one who was accustomed to rule.
 Taller and  broader than her husband, her flowing gown of sendall, and fur-lined  tippet, could not conceal the gaunt and ungraceful outlines of her  figure.
 It was the age of martial women.
 The deeds of black Agnes of  Dunbar, of Lady Salisbury and of the Countess of Montfort, were still  fresh in the public minds.
 With such examples before them the wives of  the English captains had become as warlike as their mates, and ordered  their castles in their absence with the prudence and discipline of  veteran seneschals.
 Right easy were the Montacutes of their Castle  of Twynham, and little had they to dread from roving galley or French  squadron, while Lady Mary Loring had the ordering of it.
 Yet even in  that age it was thought that, though a lady might have a soldier's  heart, it was scarce as well that she should have a soldier's face.
  There were men who said that of all the stern passages and daring deeds  by which Sir Nigel Loring had proved the true temper of his courage, not  the least was his wooing and winning of so forbidding a dame.
    "I tell you, my fair lord," she was saying, "that it is no fit training  for a demoiselle: hawks and hounds, rotes and citoles singing a French  rondel, or reading the Gestes de Doon de Mayence, as I found her  yesternight, pretending sleep, the artful, with the corner of the scroll  thrusting forth from under her pillow.
 Lent her by Father Christopher of  the priory, forsooth--that is ever her answer.
 How shall all this help  her when she has castle of her own to keep, with a hundred mouths all  agape for beef and beer?"    "True, my sweet bird, true," answered the knight, picking a comfit from  his gold drageoir.
 "The maid is like the young filly, which kicks heels  and plunges for very lust of life.
 Give her time, dame, give her time.
"    "Well, I know that my father would have given me, not time, but a good  hazel-stick across my shoulders.
 Ma foi! I know not what the world is  coming to, when young maids may flout their elders.
 I wonder that you do  not correct her, my fair lord.
"    "Nay, my heart's comfort, I never raised hand to woman yet, and it would  be a passing strange thing if I began on my own flesh and blood.
 It was  a woman's hand which cast this lime into mine eyes, and though I saw  her stoop, and might well have stopped her ere she threw, I deemed it  unworthy of my knighthood to hinder or balk one of her sex.
"    "The hussy!" cried Lady Loring clenching her broad right hand.
 "I would  I had been at the side of her!"    "And so would I, since you would have been the nearer me my own.
 But  I doubt not that you are right, and that Maude's wings need clipping,  which I may leave in your hands when I am gone, for, in sooth, this  peaceful life is not for me, and were it not for your gracious kindness  and loving care I could not abide it a week.
 I hear that there is talk  of warlike muster at Bordeaux once more, and by St.
 Paul! it would be a  new thing if the lions of England and the red pile of Chandos were to  be seen in the field, and the roses of Loring were not waving by their  side.
"    "Now woe worth me but I feared it!" cried she, with the color all struck  from her face.
 "I have noted your absent mind, your kindling eye, your  trying and riveting of old harness.
 Consider my sweet lord, that you  have already won much honor, that we have seen but little of each other,  that you bear upon your body the scar of over twenty wounds received  in I know not how many bloody encounters.
 Have you not done enough for  honor and the public cause?"    "My lady, when our liege lord, the king, at three score years, and my  Lord Chandos at three-score and ten, are blithe and ready to lay lance  in rest for England's cause, it would ill be-seem me to prate of service  done.
 It is sooth that I have received seven and twenty wounds.
 There is  the more reason that I should be thankful that I am still long of breath  and sound in limb.
 I have also seen some bickering and scuffling.
 Six  great land battles I count, with four upon sea, and seven and fifty  onfalls, skirmishes and bushments.
 I have held two and twenty towns,  and I have been at the intaking of thirty-one.
 Surely then it would  be bitter shame to me, and also to you, since my fame is yours, that I  should now hold back if a man's work is to be done.
 Besides, bethink  you how low is our purse, with bailiff and reeve ever croaking of empty  farms and wasting lands.
 Were it not for this constableship which the  Earl of Salisbury hath bestowed upon us we could scarce uphold the state  which is fitting to our degree.
 Therefore, my sweeting, there is the  more need that I should turn to where there is good pay to be earned and  brave ransoms to be won.
"    "Ah, my dear lord," quoth she, with sad, weary eyes.
 "I thought that at  last I had you to mine own self, even though your youth had been spent  afar from my side.
 Yet my voice, as I know well, should speed you on to  glory and renown, not hold you back when fame is to be won.
 Yet what can  I say, for all men know that your valor needs the curb and not the  spur.
 It goes to my heart that you should ride forth now a mere knight  bachelor, when there is no noble in the land who hath so good a claim to  the square pennon, save only that you have not the money to uphold it.
"    "And whose fault that, my sweet bird?" said he.
    "No fault, my fair lord, but a virtue: for how many rich ransoms have  you won, and yet have scattered the crowns among page and archer and  varlet, until in a week you had not as much as would buy food and  forage.
 It is a most knightly largesse, and yet withouten money how can  man rise?"    "Dirt and dross!" cried he.
    "What matter rise or fall, so that duty be done and honor gained.
  Banneret or bachelor, square pennon or forked, I would not give a denier  for the difference, and the less since Sir John Chandos, chosen flower  of English chivalry, is himself but a humble knight.
 But meanwhile fret  not thyself, my heart's dove, for it is like that there may be no war  waged, and we must await the news.
 But here are three strangers, and  one, as I take it, a soldier fresh from service.
 It is likely that he  may give us word of what is stirring over the water.
"    Lady Loring, glancing up, saw in the fading light three companions  walking abreast down the road, all gray with dust, and stained with  travel, yet chattering merrily between themselves.
 He in the midst was  young and comely, with boyish open face and bright gray eyes, which  glanced from right to left as though he found the world around him both  new and pleasing.
 To his right walked a huge red-headed man, with  broad smile and merry twinkle, whose clothes seemed to be bursting and  splitting at every seam, as though he were some lusty chick who was  breaking bravely from his shell.
 On the other side, with his knotted  hand upon the young man's shoulder, came a stout and burly archer, brown  and fierce eyed, with sword at belt and long yellow yew-stave peeping  over his shoulder.
 Hard face, battered head piece, dinted brigandine,  with faded red lion of St.
 George ramping on a discolored ground, all  proclaimed as plainly as words that he was indeed from the land of war.
  He looked keenly at Sir Nigel as he approached, and then, plunging his  hand under his breastplate, he stepped up to him with a rough, uncouth  bow to the lady.
    "Your pardon, fair sir," said he, "but I know you the moment I clap eyes  on you, though in sooth I have seen you oftener in steel than in velvet.
  I have drawn string besides you at La Roche-d'Errien, Romorantin,  Maupertuis, Nogent, Auray, and other places.
"    "Then, good archer, I am right glad to welcome you to Twynham Castle,  and in the steward's room you will find provant for yourself and  comrades.
 To me also your face is known, though mine eyes play such  tricks with me that I can scarce be sure of my own squire.
 Rest awhile,  and you shall come to the hall anon and tell us what is passing in  France, for I have heard that it is likely that our pennons may flutter  to the south of the great Spanish mountains ere another year be passed.
"    "There was talk of it in Bordeaux," answered the archer, "and I  saw myself that the armorers and smiths were as busy as rats in a  wheat-rick.
 But I bring you this letter from the valiant Gascon knight,  Sir Claude Latour.
 And to you, Lady," he added after a pause, "I bring  from him this box of red sugar of Narbonne, with every courteous and  knightly greeting which a gallant cavalier may make to a fair and noble  dame.
"    This little speech had cost the blunt bowman much pains and planning;  but he might have spared his breath, for the lady was quite as much  absorbed as her lord in the letter, which they held between them, a  hand on either corner, spelling it out very slowly, with drawn brows and  muttering lips.
 As they read it, Alleyne, who stood with Hordle John a  few paces back from their comrade, saw the lady catch her breath, while  the knight laughed softly to himself.
    "You see, dear heart," said he, "that they will not leave the old dog  in his kennel when the game is afoot.
 And what of this White Company,  archer?"    "Ah, sir, you speak of dogs," cried Aylward; "but there are a pack  of lusty hounds who are ready for any quarry, if they have but a good  huntsman to halloo them on.
 Sir, we have been in the wars together, and  I have seen many a brave following but never such a set of woodland boys  as this.
 They do but want you at their head, and who will bar the way to  them!"    "Pardieu!" said Sir Nigel, "if they are all like their messenger, they  are indeed men of whom a leader may be proud.
 Your name, good archer?"    "Sam Aylward, sir, of the Hundred of Easebourne and the Rape of  Chichester.
"    "And this giant behind you?"    "He is big John, of Hordle, a forest man, who hath now taken service in  the Company.
"    "A proper figure of a man at-arms," said the little knight.
 "Why, man,  you are no chicken, yet I warrant him the stronger man.
 See to that  great stone from the coping which hath fallen upon the bridge.
 Four of  my lazy varlets strove this day to carry it hence.
 I would that you two  could put them to shame by budging it, though I fear that I overtask  you, for it is of a grievous weight.
"    He pointed as he spoke to a huge rough-hewn block which lay by the  roadside, deep sunken from its own weight in the reddish earth.
 The  archer approached it, rolling back the sleeves of his jerkin, but with  no very hopeful countenance, for indeed it was a mighty rock.
 John,  however, put him aside with his left hand, and, stooping over the stone,  he plucked it single-handed from its soft bed and swung it far into the  stream.
 There it fell with mighty splash, one jagged end peaking out  above the surface, while the waters bubbled and foamed with far-circling  eddy.
    "Good lack!" cried Sir Nigel, and "Good lack!" cried his lady, while  John stood laughing and wiping the caked dirt from his fingers.
    "I have felt his arms round my ribs," said the bowman, "and they crackle  yet at the thought of it.
 This other comrade of mine is a right learned  clerk, for all that he is so young, hight Alleyne, the son of Edric,  brother to the Socman of Minstead.
"    "Young man," quoth Sir Nigel, sternly, "if you are of the same way of  thought as your brother, you may not pass under portcullis of mine.
"    "Nay, fair sir," cried Aylward hastily, "I will be pledge for it that  they have no thought in common; for this very day his brother hath set  his dogs upon him, and driven him from his lands.
"    "And are you, too, of the White Company?" asked Sir Nigel.
 "Hast had  small experience of war, if I may judge by your looks and bearing.
"    "I would fain to France with my friends here," Alleyne answered; "but I  am a man of peace--a reader, exorcist, acolyte, and clerk.
"    "That need not hinder," quoth Sir Nigel.
    "No, fair sir," cried the bowman joyously.
 "Why, I myself have served  two terms with Arnold de Cervolles, he whom they called the archpriest.
  By my hilt! I have seen him ere now, with monk's gown trussed to his  knees, over his sandals in blood in the fore-front of the battle.
 Yet,  ere the last string had twanged, he would be down on his four bones  among the stricken, and have them all houseled and shriven, as quick as  shelling peas.
 Ma foi! there were those who wished that he would have  less care for their souls and a little more for their bodies!"    "It is well to have a learned clerk in every troop," said Sir Nigel.
 "By  St.
 Paul, there are men so caitiff that they think more of a scrivener's  pen than of their lady's smile, and do their devoir in hopes that they  may fill a line in a chronicle or make a tag to a jongleur's romance.
 I  remember well that, at the siege of Retters, there was a little, sleek,  fat clerk of the name of Chaucer, who was so apt at rondel, sirvente, or  tonson, that no man dare give back a foot from the walls, lest he find  it all set down in his rhymes and sung by every underling and varlet  in the camp.
 But, my soul's bird, you hear me prate as though all were  decided, when I have not yet taken counsel either with you or with my  lady mother.
 Let us to the chamber, while these strangers find such fare  as pantry and cellar may furnish.
"    "The night air strikes chill," said the lady, and turned down the road  with her hand upon her lord's arm.
 The three comrades dropped behind and  followed: Aylward much the lighter for having accomplished his mission,  Alleyne full of wonderment at the humble bearing of so renowned  a captain, and John loud with snorts and sneers, which spoke his  disappointment and contempt.
    "What ails the man?" asked Aylward in surprise.
    "I have been cozened and bejaped," quoth he gruffly.
    "By whom, Sir Samson the strong?"    "By thee, Sir Balaam the false prophet.
"    "By my hilt!" cried the archer, "though I be not Balaam, yet I hold  converse with the very creature that spake to him.
 What is amiss, then,  and how have I played you false?"    "Why, marry, did you not say, and Alleyne here will be my witness, that,  if I would hie to the wars with you, you would place me under a leader  who was second to none in all England for valor? Yet here you bring me  to a shred of a man, peaky and ill-nourished, with eyes like a moulting  owl, who must needs, forsooth, take counsel with his mother ere he  buckle sword to girdle.
"    "Is that where the shoe galls?" cried the bowman, and laughed aloud.
  "I will ask you what you think of him three months hence, if we be all  alive; for sure I am that----"    Aylward's words were interrupted by an extraordinary hubbub which broke  out that instant some little way down the street in the direction of the  Priory.
 There was deep-mouthed shouting of men, frightened shrieks of  women, howling and barking of curs, and over all a sullen, thunderous  rumble, indescribably menacing and terrible.
 Round the corner of the  narrow street there came rushing a brace of whining dogs with tails  tucked under their legs, and after them a white-faced burgher, with  outstretched hands and wide-spread fingers, his hair all abristle and  his eyes glinting back from one shoulder to the other, as though some  great terror were at his very heels.
 "Fly, my lady, fly!" he screeched,  and whizzed past them like bolt from bow; while close behind came  lumbering a huge black bear, with red tongue lolling from his mouth, and  a broken chain jangling behind him.
 To right and left the folk flew for  arch and doorway.
 Hordle John caught up the Lady Loring as though  she had been a feather, and sprang with her into an open porch; while  Aylward, with a whirl of French oaths, plucked at his quiver and tried  to unsling his bow.
 Alleyne, all unnerved at so strange and unwonted a  sight, shrunk up against the wall with his eyes fixed upon the frenzied  creature, which came bounding along with ungainly speed, looking the  larger in the uncertain light, its huge jaws agape, with blood and  slaver trickling to the ground.
 Sir Nigel alone, unconscious to all  appearance of the universal panic, walked with unfaltering step up  the centre of the road, a silken handkerchief in one hand and his gold  comfit-box in the other.
 It sent the blood cold through Alleyne's veins  to see that as they came together--the man and the beast--the creature  reared up, with eyes ablaze with fear and hate, and whirled its great  paws above the knight to smite him to the earth.
 He, however, blinking  with puckered eyes, reached up his kerchief, and flicked the beast twice  across the snout with it.
 "Ah, saucy! saucy," quoth he, with gentle  chiding; on which the bear, uncertain and puzzled, dropped its four legs  to earth again, and, waddling back, was soon swathed in ropes by the  bear-ward and a crowd of peasants who had been in close pursuit.
    A scared man was the keeper; for, having chained the brute to a stake  while he drank a stoup of ale at the inn, it had been baited by stray  curs, until, in wrath and madness, it had plucked loose the chain, and  smitten or bitten all who came in its path.
 Most scared of all was he  to find that the creature had come nigh to harm the Lord and Lady of the  castle, who had power to place him in the stretch-neck or to have the  skin scourged from his shoulders.
 Yet, when he came with bowed head  and humble entreaty for forgiveness, he was met with a handful of  small silver from Sir Nigel, whose dame, however, was less charitably  disposed, being much ruffled in her dignity by the manner in which she  had been hustled from her lord's side.
    As they passed through the castle gate, John plucked at Aylward's  sleeve, and the two fell behind.
    "I must crave your pardon, comrade," said he, bluntly.
 "I was a fool not  to know that a little rooster may be the gamest.
 I believe that this man  is indeed a leader whom we may follow.
"        .
 HOW A YOUNG SHEPHERD HAD A PERILOUS FLOCK.
      Black was the mouth of Twynham Castle, though a pair of torches burning  at the further end of the gateway cast a red glare over the outer  bailey, and sent a dim, ruddy flicker through the rough-hewn arch,  rising and falling with fitful brightness.
 Over the door the travellers  could discern the escutcheon of the Montacutes, a roebuck gules on a  field argent, flanked on either side by smaller shields which bore the  red roses of the veteran constable.
 As they passed over the drawbridge,  Alleyne marked the gleam of arms in the embrasures to right and left,  and they had scarce set foot upon the causeway ere a hoarse blare  burst from a bugle, and, with screech of hinge and clank of chain, the  ponderous bridge swung up into the air, drawn by unseen hands.
 At the  same instant the huge portcullis came rattling down from above, and shut  off the last fading light of day.
 Sir Nigel and his lady walked on in  deep talk, while a fat under-steward took charge of the three comrades,  and led them to the buttery, where beef, bread, and beer were kept ever  in readiness for the wayfarer.
 After a hearty meal and a dip in the  trough to wash the dust from them, they strolled forth into the bailey,  where the bowman peered about through the darkness at wall and at keep,  with the carping eyes of one who has seen something of sieges, and is  not likely to be satisfied.
 To Alleyne and to John, however, it appeared  to be as great and as stout a fortress as could be built by the hands of  man.
    Erected by Sir Balwin de Redvers in the old fighting days of the twelfth  century, when men thought much of war and little of comfort, Castle  Twynham had been designed as a stronghold pure and simple, unlike those  later and more magnificent structures where warlike strength had been  combined with the magnificence of a palace.
 From the time of the Edwards  such buildings as Conway or Caernarvon castles, to say nothing of Royal  Windsor, had shown that it was possible to secure luxury in peace as  well as security in times of trouble.
 Sir Nigel's trust, however, still  frowned above the smooth-flowing waters of the Avon, very much as the  stern race of early Anglo-Normans had designed it.
 There were the broad  outer and inner bailies, not paved, but sown with grass to nourish the  sheep and cattle which might be driven in on sign of danger.
 All round  were high and turreted walls, with at the corner a bare square-faced  keep, gaunt and windowless, rearing up from a lofty mound, which made it  almost inaccessible to an assailant.
 Against the bailey-walls were rows  of frail wooden houses and leaning sheds, which gave shelter to the  archers and men-at-arms who formed the garrison.
 The doors of these  humble dwellings were mostly open, and against the yellow glare from  within Alleyne could see the bearded fellows cleaning their harness,  while their wives would come out for a gossip, with their needlework in  their hands, and their long black shadows streaming across the yard.
  The air was full of the clack of their voices and the merry prattling of  children, in strange contrast to the flash of arms and constant warlike  challenge from the walls above.
    "Methinks a company of school lads could hold this place against an  army," quoth John.
    "And so say I," said Alleyne.
    "Nay, there you are wide of the clout," the bowman said gravely.
 "By my  hilt! I have seen a stronger fortalice carried in a summer evening.
  I remember such a one in Picardy, with a name as long as a Gascon's  pedigree.
 It was when I served under Sir Robert Knolles, before the days  of the Company; and we came by good plunder at the sacking of it.
 I had  myself a great silver bowl, with two goblets, and a plastron of Spanish  steel.
 Pasques Dieu! there are some fine women over yonder! Mort de ma  vie! see to that one in the doorway! I will go speak to her.
 But whom  have we here?"    "Is there an archer here hight Sam Aylward?" asked a gaunt man-at-arms,  clanking up to them across the courtyard.
    "My name, friend," quoth the bowman.
    "Then sure I have no need to tell thee mine," said the other.
    "By the rood! if it is not Black Simon of Norwich!" cried Aylward.
 "A  mon coeur, camarade, a mon coeur! Ah, but I am blithe to see thee!" The  two fell upon each other and hugged like bears.
    "And where from, old blood and bones?" asked the bowman.
    "I am in service here.
 Tell me, comrade, is it sooth that we shall have  another fling at these Frenchmen? It is so rumored in the guard-room,  and that Sir Nigel will take the field once more.
"    "It is like enough, mon gar.
, as things go.
"    "Now may the Lord be praised!" cried the other.
 "This very night will I  set apart a golden ouche to be offered on the shrine of my name-saint.
 I  have pined for this, Aylward, as a young maid pines for her lover.
"    "Art so set on plunder then? Is the purse so light that there is not  enough for a rouse? I have a bag at my belt, camarade, and you have but  to put your fist into it for what you want.
 It was ever share and share  between us.
"    "Nay, friend, it is not the Frenchman's gold, but the Frenchman's blood  that I would have.
 I should not rest quiet in the grave, coz, if I had  not another turn at them.
 For with us in France it has ever been fair  and honest war--a shut fist for the man, but a bended knee for the  woman.
 But how was it at Winchelsea when their galleys came down upon it  some few years back? I had an old mother there, lad, who had come down  thither from the Midlands to be the nearer her son.
 They found her  afterwards by her own hearthstone, thrust through by a Frenchman's bill.
  My second sister, my brother's wife, and her two children, they were but  ash-heaps in the smoking ruins of their house.
 I will not say that we  have not wrought great scath upon France, but women and children have  been safe from us.
 And so, old friend, my heart is hot within me, and I  long to hear the old battle-cry again, and, by God's truth! if Sir  Nigel unfurls his pennon, here is one who will be right glad to feel the  saddle-flaps under his knees.
"    "We have seen good work together, old war-dog," quoth Aylward; "and,  by my hilt! we may hope to see more ere we die.
 But we are more like to  hawk at the Spanish woodcock than at the French heron, though certes  it is rumored that Du Guesclin with all the best lances of France have  taken service under the lions and towers of Castile.
 But, comrade, it is  in my mind that there is some small matter of dispute still open between  us.
"    "'Fore God, it is sooth!" cried the other; "I had forgot it.
 The  provost-marshal and his men tore us apart when last we met.
"    "On which, friend, we vowed that we should settle the point when next we  came together.
 Hast thy sword, I see, and the moon throws glimmer enough  for such old night-birds as we.
 On guard, mon gar.
! I have not heard  clink of steel this month or more.
"    "Out from the shadow then," said the other, drawing his sword.
 "A vow is  a vow, and not lightly to be broken.
"    "A vow to the saints," cried Alleyne, "is indeed not to be set aside;  but this is a devil's vow, and, simple clerk as I am, I am yet the  mouthpiece of the true church when I say that it were mortal sin to  fight on such a quarrel.
 What! shall two grown men carry malice for  years, and fly like snarling curs at each other's throats?"    "No malice, my young clerk, no malice," quoth Black Simon.
 "I have not  a bitter drop in my heart for mine old comrade; but the quarrel, as he  hath told you, is still open and unsettled.
 Fall on, Aylward!"    "Not whilst I can stand between you," cried Alleyne, springing before  the bowman.
 "It is shame and sin to see two Christian Englishmen turn  swords against each other like the frenzied bloodthirsty paynim.
"    "And, what is more," said Hordle John, suddenly appearing out of the  buttery with the huge board upon which the pastry was rolled, "if either  raise sword I shall flatten him like a Shrovetide pancake.
 By the black  rood! I shall drive him into the earth, like a nail into a door, rather  than see you do scath to each other.
"    "'Fore God, this is a strange way of preaching peace," cried Black  Simon.
 "You may find the scath yourself, my lusty friend, if you raise  your great cudgel to me.
 I had as lief have the castle drawbridge drop  upon my pate.
"    "Tell me, Aylward," said Alleyne earnestly, with his hands outstretched  to keep the pair asunder, "what is the cause of quarrel, that we may see  whether honorable settlement may not be arrived at?"    The bowman looked down at his feet and then up at the moon.
 "Parbleu!"  he cried, "the cause of quarrel? Why, mon petit, it was years ago in  Limousin, and how can I bear in mind what was the cause of it? Simon  there hath it at the end of his tongue.
"    "Not I, in troth," replied the other; "I have had other things to think  of.
 There was some sort of bickering over dice, or wine, or was it a  woman, coz?"    "Pasques Dieu! but you have nicked it," cried Aylward.
 "It was indeed  about a woman; and the quarrel must go forward, for I am still of the  same mind as before.
"    "What of the woman, then?" asked Simon.
 "May the murrain strike me if I  can call to mind aught about her.
"    "It was La Blanche Rose, maid at the sign of the 'Trois Corbeaux' at  Limoges.
 Bless her pretty heart! Why, mon gar.
, I loved her.
"    "So did a many," quoth Simon.
 "I call her to mind now.
 On the very day  that we fought over the little hussy, she went off with Evan ap Price,  a long-legged Welsh dagsman.
 They have a hostel of their own now,  somewhere on the banks of the Garonne, where the landlord drinks so much  of the liquor that there is little left for the customers.
"    "So ends our quarrel, then," said Aylward, sheathing his sword.
 "A Welsh  dagsman, i' faith! C'etait mauvais gout, camarade, and the more so when  she had a jolly archer and a lusty man-at-arms to choose from.
"    "True, old lad.
 And it is as well that we can compose our differences  honorably, for Sir Nigel had been out at the first clash of steel; and  he hath sworn that if there be quarrelling in the garrison he would  smite the right hand from the broilers.
 You know him of old, and that he  is like to be as good as his word.
"    "Mort-Dieu! yes.
 But there are ale, mead, and wine in the buttery, and  the steward a merry rogue, who will not haggle over a quart or two.
  Buvons, mon gar.
, for it is not every day that two old friends come  together.
"    The old soldiers and Hordle John strode off together in all good  fellowship.
 Alleyne had turned to follow them, when he felt a touch upon  his shoulder, and found a young page by his side.
    "The Lord Loring commands," said the boy, "that you will follow me to  the great chamber, and await him there.
"    "But my comrades?"    "His commands were for you alone.
"    Alleyne followed the messenger to the east end of the courtyard, where a  broad flight of steps led up to the doorway of the main hall, the outer  wall of which is washed by the waters of the Avon.
 As designed at first,  no dwelling had been allotted to the lord of the castle and his family  but the dark and dismal basement story of the keep.
 A more civilized or  more effeminate generation, however, had refused to be pent up in such  a cellar, and the hall with its neighboring chambers had been added for  their accommodation.
 Up the broad steps Alleyne went, still following  his boyish guide, until at the folding oak doors the latter paused, and  ushered him into the main hall of the castle.
    On entering the room the clerk looked round; but, seeing no one, he  continued to stand, his cap in his hand, examining with the greatest  interest a chamber which was so different to any to which he was  accustomed.
 The days had gone by when a nobleman's hall was but a  barn-like, rush-strewn enclosure, the common lounge and eating-room of  every inmate of the castle.
 The Crusaders had brought back with them  experiences of domestic luxuries, of Damascus carpets and rugs of  Aleppo, which made them impatient of the hideous bareness and want of  privacy which they found in their ancestral strongholds.
 Still stronger,  however, had been the influence of the great French war; for, however  well matched the nations might be in martial exercises, there could be  no question but that our neighbors were infinitely superior to us in the  arts of peace.
 A stream of returning knights, of wounded soldiers,  and of unransomed French noblemen, had been for a quarter of a century  continually pouring into England, every one of whom exerted an influence  in the direction of greater domestic refinement, while shiploads of  French furniture from Calais, Rouen, and other plundered towns, had  supplied our own artisans with models on which to shape their work.
  Hence, in most English castles, and in Castle Twynham among the rest,  chambers were to be found which would seem to be not wanting either in  beauty or in comfort.
    In the great stone fireplace a log fire was spurting and crackling,  throwing out a ruddy glare which, with the four bracket-lamps which  stood at each corner of the room, gave a bright and lightsome air to the  whole apartment.
 Above was a wreath-work of blazonry, extending up to  the carved and corniced oaken roof; while on either side stood the high  canopied chairs placed for the master of the house and for his most  honored guest.
 The walls were hung all round with most elaborate and  brightly colored tapestry, representing the achievements of Sir Bevis  of Hampton, and behind this convenient screen were stored the tables  dormant and benches which would be needed for banquet or high festivity.
  The floor was of polished tiles, with a square of red and black diapered  Flemish carpet in the centre; and many settees, cushions, folding  chairs, and carved bancals littered all over it.
 At the further end was  a long black buffet or dresser, thickly covered with gold cups, silver  salvers, and other such valuables.
 All this Alleyne examined with  curious eyes; but most interesting of all to him was a small ebony  table at his very side, on which, by the side of a chess-board and the  scattered chessmen, there lay an open manuscript written in a right  clerkly hand, and set forth with brave flourishes and devices along the  margins.
 In vain Alleyne bethought him of where he was, and of those  laws of good breeding and decorum which should restrain him: those  colored capitals and black even lines drew his hand down to them, as  the loadstone draws the needle, until, almost before he knew it, he  was standing with the romance of Garin de Montglane before his eyes, so  absorbed in its contents as to be completely oblivious both of where he  was and why he had come there.
    He was brought back to himself, however, by a sudden little ripple of  quick feminine laughter.
 Aghast, he dropped the manuscript among the  chessmen and stared in bewilderment round the room.
 It was as empty and  as still as ever.
 Again he stretched his hand out to the romance, and  again came that roguish burst of merriment.
 He looked up at the ceiling,  back at the closed door, and round at the stiff folds of motionless  tapestry.
 Of a sudden, however, he caught a quick shimmer from the  corner of a high-backed bancal in front of him, and, shifting a pace  or two to the side, saw a white slender hand, which held a mirror of  polished silver in such a way that the concealed observer could see  without being seen.
 He stood irresolute, uncertain whether to advance or  to take no notice; but, even as he hesitated, the mirror was whipped  in, and a tall and stately young lady swept out from behind the oaken  screen, with a dancing light of mischief in her eyes.
 Alleyne started  with astonishment as he recognized the very maiden who had suffered  from his brother's violence in the forest.
 She no longer wore her gay  riding-dress, however, but was attired in a long sweeping robe of black  velvet of Bruges, with delicate tracery of white lace at neck and at  wrist, scarce to be seen against her ivory skin.
 Beautiful as she had  seemed to him before, the lithe charm of her figure and the proud, free  grace of her bearing were enhanced now by the rich simplicity of her  attire.
    "Ah, you start," said she, with the same sidelong look of mischief,  "and I cannot marvel at it.
 Didst not look to see the distressed damosel  again.
 Oh that I were a minstrel, that I might put it into rhyme,  with the whole romance--the luckless maid, the wicked socman, and the  virtuous clerk! So might our fame have gone down together for all time,  and you be numbered with Sir Percival or Sir Galahad, or all the other  rescuers of oppressed ladies.
"    "What I did," said Alleyne, "was too small a thing for thanks; and yet,  if I may say it without offence, it was too grave and near a matter  for mirth and raillery.
 I had counted on my brother's love, but God has  willed that it should be otherwise.
 It is a joy to me to see you again,  lady, and to know that you have reached home in safety, if this be  indeed your home.
"    "Yes, in sooth, Castle Twynham is my home, and Sir Nigel Loring my  father.
 I should have told you so this morning, but you said that you  were coming thither, so I bethought me that I might hold it back as  a surprise to you.
 Oh dear, but it was brave to see you!" she cried,  bursting out a-laughing once more, and standing with her hand pressed to  her side, and her half-closed eyes twinkling with amusement.
 "You drew  back and came forward with your eyes upon my book there, like the mouse  who sniffs the cheese and yet dreads the trap.
"    "I take shame," said Alleyne, "that I should have touched it.
"    "Nay, it warmed my very heart to see it.
 So glad was I, that I laughed  for very pleasure.
 My fine preacher can himself be tempted then, thought  I; he is not made of another clay to the rest of us.
"    "God help me! I am the weakest of the weak," groaned Alleyne.
 "I pray  that I may have more strength.
"    "And to what end?" she asked sharply.
 "If you are, as I understand, to  shut yourself forever in your cell within the four walls of an abbey,  then of what use would it be were your prayer to be answered?"    "The use of my own salvation.
"    She turned from him with a pretty shrug and wave.
 "Is that all?" she  said.
 "Then you are no better than Father Christopher and the rest of  them.
 Your own, your own, ever your own! My father is the king's man,  and when he rides into the press of fight he is not thinking ever of the  saving of his own poor body; he recks little enough if he leave it on  the field.
 Why then should you, who are soldiers of the Spirit, be  ever moping or hiding in cell or in cave, with minds full of your own  concerns, while the world, which you should be mending, is going on its  way, and neither sees nor hears you? Were ye all as thoughtless of your  own souls as the soldier is of his body, ye would be of more avail to  the souls of others.
"    "There is sooth in what you say, lady," Alleyne answered; "and yet I  scarce can see what you would have the clergy and the church to do.
"    "I would have them live as others and do men's work in the world,  preaching by their lives rather than their words.
 I would have them come  forth from their lonely places, mix with the borel folks, feel the pains  and the pleasures, the cares and the rewards, the temptings and the  stirrings of the common people.
 Let them toil and swinken, and labor,  and plough the land, and take wives to themselves----"    "Alas! alas!" cried Alleyne aghast, "you have surely sucked this poison  from the man Wicliffe, of whom I have heard such evil things.
"    "Nay, I know him not.
 I have learned it by looking from my own chamber  window and marking these poor monks of the priory, their weary life,  their profitless round.
 I have asked myself if the best which can be  done with virtue is to shut it within high walls as though it were some  savage creature.
 If the good will lock themselves up, and if the wicked  will still wander free, then alas for the world!"    Alleyne looked at her in astonishment, for her cheek was flushed, her  eyes gleaming, and her whole pose full of eloquence and conviction.
 Yet  in an instant she had changed again to her old expression of merriment  leavened with mischief.
    "Wilt do what I ask?" said she.
    "What is it, lady?"    "Oh, most ungallant clerk! A true knight would never have asked, but  would have vowed upon the instant.
 'Tis but to bear me out in what I say  to my father.
"    "In what?"    "In saying, if he ask, that it was south of the Christchurch road that I  met you.
 I shall be shut up with the tire-women else, and have a week  of spindle and bodkin, when I would fain be galloping Troubadour up  Wilverley Walk, or loosing little Roland at the Vinney Ridge herons.
"    "I shall not answer him if he ask.
"    "Not answer! But he will have an answer.
 Nay, but you must not fail me,  or it will go ill with me.
"    "But, lady," cried poor Alleyne in great distress, "how can I say that  it was to the south of the road when I know well that it was four miles  to the north.
"    "You will not say it?"    "Surely you will not, too, when you know that it is not so?"    "Oh, I weary of your preaching!" she cried, and swept away with a toss  of her beautiful head, leaving Alleyne as cast down and ashamed as  though he had himself proposed some infamous thing.
 She was back again  in an instant, however, in another of her varying moods.
    "Look at that, my friend!" said she.
 "If you had been shut up in abbey  or in cell this day you could not have taught a wayward maiden to abide  by the truth.
 Is it not so? What avail is the shepherd if he leaves his  sheep.
"    "A sorry shepherd!" said Alleyne humbly.
 "But here is your noble  father.
"    "And you shall see how worthy a pupil I am.
 Father, I am much beholden  to this young clerk, who was of service to me and helped me this very  morning in Minstead Woods, four miles to the north of the Christchurch  road, where I had no call to be, you having ordered it otherwise.
" All  this she reeled off in a loud voice, and then glanced with sidelong,  questioning eyes at Alleyne for his approval.
    Sir Nigel, who had entered the room with a silvery-haired old lady upon  his arm, stared aghast at this sudden outburst of candor.
    "Maude, Maude!" said he, shaking his head, "it is more hard for me to  gain obedience from you than from the ten score drunken archers who  followed me to Guienne.
 Yet, hush! little one, for your fair lady-mother  will be here anon, and there is no need that she should know it.
 We will  keep you from the provost-marshal this journey.
 Away to your chamber,  sweeting, and keep a blithe face, for she who confesses is shriven.
 And  now, fair mother," he continued, when his daughter had gone, "sit  you here by the fire, for your blood runs colder than it did.
 Alleyne  Edricson, I would have a word with you, for I would fain that you should  take service under me.
 And here in good time comes my lady, without  whose counsel it is not my wont to decide aught of import; but, indeed,  it was her own thought that you should come.
"    "For I have formed a good opinion of you, and can see that you are one  who may be trusted," said the Lady Loring.
 "And in good sooth my dear  lord hath need of such a one by his side, for he recks so little of  himself that there should be one there to look to his needs and meet his  wants.
 You have seen the cloisters; it were well that you should see the  world too, ere you make choice for life between them.
"    "It was for that very reason that my father willed that I should come  forth into the world at my twentieth year," said Alleyne.
    "Then your father was a man of good counsel," said she, "and you cannot  carry out his will better than by going on this path, where all that is  noble and gallant in England will be your companions.
"    "You can ride?" asked Sir Nigel, looking at the youth with puckered  eyes.
    "Yes, I have ridden much at the abbey.
"    "Yet there is a difference betwixt a friar's hack and a warrior's  destrier.
 You can sing and play?"    "On citole, flute and rebeck.
"    "Good! You can read blazonry?"    "Indifferent well.
"    "Then read this," quoth Sir Nigel, pointing upwards to one of the many  quarterings which adorned the wall over the fireplace.
    "Argent," Alleyne answered, "a fess azure charged with three lozenges  dividing three mullets sable.
 Over all, on an escutcheon of the first, a  jambe gules.
"    "A jambe gules erased," said Sir Nigel, shaking his head solemnly.
 "Yet  it is not amiss for a monk-bred man.
 I trust that you are lowly and  serviceable?"    "I have served all my life, my lord.
"    "Canst carve too?"    "I have carved two days a week for the brethren.
"    "A model truly! Wilt make a squire of squires.
 But tell me, I pray,  canst curl hair?"    "No, my lord, but I could learn.
"    "It is of import," said he, "for I love to keep my hair well ordered,  seeing that the weight of my helmet for thirty years hath in some degree  frayed it upon the top.
" He pulled off his velvet cap of maintenance as  he spoke, and displayed a pate which was as bald as an egg, and shone  bravely in the firelight.
 "You see," said he, whisking round, and  showing one little strip where a line of scattered hairs, like the last  survivors in some fatal field, still barely held their own against the  fate which had fallen upon their comrades; "these locks need some little  oiling and curling, for I doubt not that if you look slantwise at my  head, when the light is good, you will yourself perceive that there are  places where the hair is sparse.
"    "It is for you also to bear the purse," said the lady; "for my sweet  lord is of so free and gracious a temper that he would give it gayly to  the first who asked alms of him.
 All these things, with some knowledge  of venerie, and of the management of horse, hawk and hound, with the  grace and hardihood and courtesy which are proper to your age, will make  you a fit squire for Sir Nigel Loring.
"    "Alas! lady," Alleyne answered, "I know well the great honor that you  have done me in deeming me worthy to wait upon so renowned a knight,  yet I am so conscious of my own weakness that I scarce dare incur duties  which I might be so ill-fitted to fulfil.
"    "Modesty and a humble mind," said she, "are the very first and rarest  gifts in page or squire.
 Your words prove that you have these, and  all the rest is but the work of use and time.
 But there is no call for  haste.
 Rest upon it for the night, and let your orisons ask for guidance  in the matter.
 We knew your father well, and would fain help his son,  though we have small cause to love your brother the Socman, who is  forever stirring up strife in the county.
"    "We can scare hope," said Nigel, "to have all ready for our start before  the feast of St.
 Luke, for there is much to be done in the time.
 You  will have leisure, therefore, if it please you to take service under me,  in which to learn your devoir.
 Bertrand, my daughter's page, is hot to  go; but in sooth he is over young for such rough work as may be before  us.
"    "And I have one favor to crave from you," added the lady of the castle,  as Alleyne turned to leave their presence.
 "You have, as I understand,  much learning which you have acquired at Beaulieu.
"    "Little enough, lady, compared with those who were my teachers.
"    "Yet enough for my purpose, I doubt not.
 For I would have you give  an hour or two a day whilst you are with us in discoursing with my  daughter, the Lady Maude; for she is somewhat backward, I fear, and hath  no love for letters, save for these poor fond romances, which do but  fill her empty head with dreams of enchanted maidens and of errant  cavaliers.
 Father Christopher comes over after nones from the priory,  but he is stricken with years and slow of speech, so that she gets small  profit from his teaching.
 I would have you do what you can with her, and  with Agatha my young tire-woman, and with Dorothy Pierpont.
"    And so Alleyne found himself not only chosen as squire to a knight but  also as squire to three damosels, which was even further from the part  which he had thought to play in the world.
 Yet he could but agree to  do what he might, and so went forth from the castle hall with his  face flushed and his head in a whirl at the thought of the strange and  perilous paths which his feet were destined to tread.
        .
 HOW ALLEYNE LEARNED MORE THAN HE COULD TEACH.
      And now there came a time of stir and bustle, of furbishing of arms and  clang of hammer from all the southland counties.
 Fast spread the tidings  from thorpe to thorpe and from castle to castle, that the old game was  afoot once more, and the lions and lilies to be in the field with the  early spring.
 Great news this for that fierce old country, whose trade  for a generation had been war, her exports archers and her imports  prisoners.
 For six years her sons had chafed under an unwonted peace.
  Now they flew to their arms as to their birthright.
 The old soldiers of  Crecy, of Nogent, and of Poictiers were glad to think that they might  hear the war-trumpet once more, and gladder still were the hot youth who  had chafed for years under the martial tales of their sires.
 To pierce  the great mountains of the south, to fight the tamers of the fiery  Moors, to follow the greatest captain of the age, to find sunny  cornfields and vineyards, when the marches of Picardy and Normandy were  as rare and bleak as the Jedburgh forests--here was a golden prospect  for a race of warriors.
 From sea to sea there was stringing of bows in  the cottage and clang of steel in the castle.
    Nor did it take long for every stronghold to pour forth its cavalry, and  every hamlet its footmen.
 Through the late autumn and the early winter  every road and country lane resounded with nakir and trumpet, with the  neigh of the war-horse and the clatter of marching men.
 From the Wrekin  in the Welsh marches to the Cotswolds in the west or Butser in the  south, there was no hill-top from which the peasant might not have seen  the bright shimmer of arms, the toss and flutter of plume and of pensil.
  From bye-path, from woodland clearing, or from winding moor-side track  these little rivulets of steel united in the larger roads to form a  broader stream, growing ever fuller and larger as it approached the  nearest or most commodious seaport.
 And there all day, and day after  day, there was bustle and crowding and labor, while the great ships  loaded up, and one after the other spread their white pinions and darted  off to the open sea, amid the clash of cymbals and rolling of drums and  lusty shouts of those who went and of those who waited.
 From Orwell to  the Dart there was no port which did not send forth its little fleet,  gay with streamer and bunting, as for a joyous festival.
 Thus in the  season of the waning days the might of England put forth on to the  waters.
    In the ancient and populous county of Hampshire there was no lack of  leaders or of soldiers for a service which promised either honor or  profit.
 In the north the Saracen's head of the Brocas and the scarlet  fish of the De Roches were waving over a strong body of archers from  Holt, Woolmer, and Harewood forests.
 De Borhunte was up in the east, and  Sir John de Montague in the west.
 Sir Luke de Ponynges, Sir Thomas West,  Sir Maurice de Bruin, Sir Arthur Lipscombe, Sir Walter Ramsey, and stout  Sir Oliver Buttesthorn were all marching south with levies from Andover,  Arlesford, Odiham and Winchester, while from Sussex came Sir John  Clinton, Sir Thomas Cheyne, and Sir John Fallislee, with a troop of  picked men-at-arms, making for their port at Southampton.
 Greatest of  all the musters, however, was that of Twynham Castle, for the name and  the fame of Sir Nigel Loring drew towards him the keenest and boldest  spirits, all eager to serve under so valiant a leader.
 Archers from the  New Forest and the Forest of Bere, billmen from the pleasant country  which is watered by the Stour, the Avon, and the Itchen, young cavaliers  from the ancient Hampshire houses, all were pushing for Christchurch to  take service under the banner of the five scarlet roses.
    And now, could Sir Nigel have shown the bachelles of land which the laws  of rank required, he might well have cut his forked pennon into a  square banner, and taken such a following into the field as would have  supported the dignity of a banneret.
 But poverty was heavy upon him, his  land was scant, his coffers empty, and the very castle which covered him  the holding of another.
 Sore was his heart when he saw rare bowmen and  war-hardened spearmen turned away from his gates, for the lack of the  money which might equip and pay them.
 Yet the letter which Aylward had  brought him gave him powers which he was not slow to use.
 In it Sir  Claude Latour, the Gascon lieutenant of the White Company, assured him  that there remained in his keeping enough to fit out a hundred archers  and twenty men-at-arms, which, joined to the three hundred veteran  companions already in France, would make a force which any leader might  be proud to command.
 Carefully and sagaciously the veteran knight chose  out his men from the swarm of volunteers.
 Many an anxious consultation  he held with Black Simon, Sam Aylward, and other of his more experienced  followers, as to who should come and who should stay.
 By All Saints'  day, however ere the last leaves had fluttered to earth in the Wilverley  and Holmesley glades, he had filled up his full numbers, and mustered  under his banner as stout a following of Hampshire foresters as ever  twanged their war-bows.
 Twenty men-at-arms, too, well mounted and  equipped, formed the cavalry of the party, while young Peter Terlake of  Fareham, and Walter Ford of Botley, the martial sons of martial sires,  came at their own cost to wait upon Sir Nigel and to share with Alleyne  Edricson the duties of his squireship.
    Yet, even after the enrolment, there was much to be done ere the party  could proceed upon its way.
 For armor, swords, and lances, there was no  need to take much forethought, for they were to be had both better and  cheaper in Bordeaux than in England.
 With the long-bow, however, it was  different.
 Yew staves indeed might be got in Spain, but it was well to  take enough and to spare with them.
 Then three spare cords should be  carried for each bow, with a great store of arrow-heads, besides the  brigandines of chain mail, the wadded steel caps, and the brassarts or  arm-guards, which were the proper equipment of the archer.
 Above all,  the women for miles round were hard at work cutting the white surcoats  which were the badge of the Company, and adorning them with the red lion  of St.
 George upon the centre of the breast.
 When all was completed and  the muster called in the castle yard the oldest soldier of the French  wars was fain to confess that he had never looked upon a better equipped  or more warlike body of men, from the old knight with his silk jupon,  sitting his great black war-horse in the front of them, to Hordle John,  the giant recruit, who leaned carelessly upon a huge black bow-stave in  the rear.
 Of the six score, fully half had seen service before, while a  fair sprinkling were men who had followed the wars all their lives, and  had a hand in those battles which had made the whole world ring with the  fame and the wonder of the island infantry.
    Six long weeks were taken in these preparations, and it was close on  Martinmas ere all was ready for a start.
 Nigh two months had Alleyne  Edricson been in Castle Twynham--months which were fated to turn the  whole current of his life, to divert it from that dark and lonely bourne  towards which it tended, and to guide it into freer and more sunlit  channels.
 Already he had learned to bless his father for that wise  provision which had made him seek to know the world ere he had ventured  to renounce it.
    For it was a different place from that which he had pictured--very  different from that which he had heard described when the master of the  novices held forth to his charges upon the ravening wolves who lurked  for them beyond the peaceful folds of Beaulieu.
 There was cruelty in it,  doubtless, and lust and sin and sorrow; but were there not virtues to  atone, robust positive virtues which did not shrink from temptation,  which held their own in all the rough blasts of the work-a-day world?  How colorless by contrast appeared the sinlessness which came from  inability to sin, the conquest which was attained by flying from the  enemy! Monk-bred as he was, Alleyne had native shrewdness and a mind  which was young enough to form new conclusions and to outgrow old  ones.
 He could not fail to see that the men with whom he was thrown in  contact, rough-tongued, fierce and quarrelsome as they were, were yet of  deeper nature and of more service in the world than the ox-eyed brethren  who rose and ate and slept from year's end to year's end in their own  narrow, stagnant circle of existence.
 Abbot Berghersh was a good man,  but how was he better than this kindly knight, who lived as simple a  life, held as lofty and inflexible an ideal of duty, and did with all  his fearless heart whatever came to his hand to do? In turning from the  service of the one to that of the other, Alleyne could not feel that  he was lowering his aims in life.
 True that his gentle and thoughtful  nature recoiled from the grim work of war, yet in those days of martial  orders and militant brotherhoods there was no gulf fixed betwixt the  priest and the soldier.
 The man of God and the man of the sword might  without scandal be united in the same individual.
 Why then should he,  a mere clerk, have scruples when so fair a chance lay in his way of  carrying out the spirit as well as the letter of his father's provision.
  Much struggle it cost him, anxious spirit-questionings and midnight  prayings, with many a doubt and a misgiving; but the issue was that ere  he had been three days in Castle Twynham he had taken service under Sir  Nigel, and had accepted horse and harness, the same to be paid for out  of his share of the profits of the expedition.
 Henceforth for seven  hours a day he strove in the tilt-yard to qualify himself to be a worthy  squire to so worthy a knight.
 Young, supple and active, with all the  pent energies from years of pure and healthy living, it was not long  before he could manage his horse and his weapon well enough to earn  an approving nod from critical men-at-arms, or to hold his own against  Terlake and Ford, his fellow-servitors.
    But were there no other considerations which swayed him from the  cloisters towards the world? So complex is the human spirit that it can  itself scarce discern the deep springs which impel it to action.
 Yet  to Alleyne had been opened now a side of life of which he had been as  innocent as a child, but one which was of such deep import that it could  not fail to influence him in choosing his path.
 A woman, in monkish  precepts, had been the embodiment and concentration of what was  dangerous and evil--a focus whence spread all that was to be dreaded and  avoided.
 So defiling was their presence that a true Cistercian might  not raise his eyes to their face or touch their finger-tips under ban of  church and fear of deadly sin.
 Yet here, day after day for an hour  after nones, and for an hour before vespers, he found himself in close  communion with three maidens, all young, all fair, and all therefore  doubly dangerous from the monkish standpoint.
 Yet he found that in their  presence he was conscious of a quick sympathy, a pleasant ease, a ready  response to all that was most gentle and best in himself, which filled  his soul with a vague and new-found joy.
    And yet the Lady Maude Loring was no easy pupil to handle.
 An older and  more world-wise man might have been puzzled by her varying moods, her  sudden prejudices, her quick resentment at all constraint and authority.
  Did a subject interest her, was there space in it for either romance  or imagination, she would fly through it with her subtle, active mind,  leaving her two fellow-students and even her teacher toiling behind her.
  On the other hand, were there dull patience needed with steady toil and  strain of memory, no single fact could by any driving be fixed in her  mind.
 Alleyne might talk to her of the stories of old gods and heroes,  of gallant deeds and lofty aims, or he might hold forth upon moon and  stars, and let his fancy wander over the hidden secrets of the universe,  and he would have a rapt listener with flushed cheeks and eloquent eyes,  who could repeat after him the very words which had fallen from his  lips.
 But when it came to almagest and astrolabe, the counting of  figures and reckoning of epicycles, away would go her thoughts to horse  and hound, and a vacant eye and listless face would warn the teacher  that he had lost his hold upon his scholar.
 Then he had but to bring out  the old romance book from the priory, with befingered cover of sheepskin  and gold letters upon a purple ground, to entice her wayward mind back  to the paths of learning.
    At times, too, when the wild fit was upon her, she would break into  pertness and rebel openly against Alleyne's gentle firmness.
 Yet he  would jog quietly on with his teachings, taking no heed to her mutiny,  until suddenly she would be conquered by his patience, and break into  self-revilings a hundred times stronger than her fault demanded.
 It  chanced however that, on one of these mornings when the evil mood was  upon her, Agatha the young tire-woman, thinking to please her mistress,  began also to toss her head and make tart rejoinder to the teacher's  questions.
 In an instant the Lady Maude had turned upon her two blazing  eyes and a face which was blanched with anger.
    "You would dare!" said she.
 "You would dare!" The frightened tire-woman  tried to excuse herself.
 "But my fair lady," she stammered, "what have I  done? I have said no more than I heard.
"    "You would dare!" repeated the lady in a choking voice.
 "You, a  graceless baggage, a foolish lack-brain, with no thought above the  hemming of shifts.
 And he so kindly and hendy and long-suffering! You  would--ha, you may well flee the room!"    She had spoken with a rising voice, and a clasping and opening of her  long white fingers, so that it was no marvel that ere the speech was  over the skirts of Agatha were whisking round the door and the click of  her sobs to be heard dying swiftly away down the corridor.
    Alleyne stared open-eyed at this tigress who had sprung so suddenly  to his rescue.
 "There is no need for such anger," he said mildly.
 "The  maid's words have done me no scath.
 It is you yourself who have erred.
"    "I know it," she cried, "I am a most wicked woman.
 But it is bad enough  that one should misuse you.
 Ma foi! I will see that there is not a  second one.
"    "Nay, nay, no one has misused me," he answered.
 "But the fault lies  in your hot and bitter words.
 You have called her a baggage and a  lack-brain, and I know not what.
"    "And you are he who taught me to speak the truth," she cried.
 "Now I  have spoken it, and yet I cannot please you.
 Lack-brain she is, and  lack-brain I shall call her.
"    Such was a sample of the sudden janglings which marred the peace of that  little class.
 As the weeks passed, however, they became fewer and less  violent, as Alleyne's firm and constant nature gained sway and influence  over the Lady Maude.
 And yet, sooth to say, there were times when he had  to ask himself whether it was not the Lady Maude who was gaining sway  and influence over him.
 If she were changing, so was he.
 In drawing her  up from the world, he was day by day being himself dragged down towards  it.
 In vain he strove and reasoned with himself as to the madness of  letting his mind rest upon Sir Nigel's daughter.
 What was he--a younger  son, a penniless clerk, a squire unable to pay for his own harness--that  he should dare to raise his eyes to the fairest maid in Hampshire? So  spake reason; but, in spite of all, her voice was ever in his ears and  her image in his heart.
 Stronger than reason, stronger than cloister  teachings, stronger than all that might hold him back, was that old, old  tyrant who will brook no rival in the kingdom of youth.
    And yet it was a surprise and a shock to himself to find how deeply  she had entered into his life; how completely those vague ambitions and  yearnings which had filled his spiritual nature centred themselves now  upon this thing of earth.
 He had scarce dared to face the change which  had come upon him, when a few sudden chance words showed it all up hard  and clear, like a lightning flash in the darkness.
    He had ridden over to Poole, one November day, with his fellow-squire,  Peter Terlake, in quest of certain yew-staves from Wat Swathling, the  Dorsetshire armorer.
 The day for their departure had almost come, and  the two youths spurred it over the lonely downs at the top of their  speed on their homeward course, for evening had fallen and there was  much to be done.
 Peter was a hard, wiry, brown faced, country-bred lad  who looked on the coming war as the schoolboy looks on his holidays.
  This day, however, he had been sombre and mute, with scarce a word a  mile to bestow upon his comrade.
    "Tell me Alleyne Edricson," he broke out, suddenly, as they clattered  along the winding track which leads over the Bournemouth hills, "has it  not seemed to you that of late the Lady Maude is paler and more silent  than is her wont?"    "It may be so," the other answered shortly.
    "And would rather sit distrait by her oriel than ride gayly to the chase  as of old.
 Methinks, Alleyne, it is this learning which you have taught  her that has taken all the life and sap from her.
 It is more than she  can master, like a heavy spear to a light rider.
"    "Her lady-mother has so ordered it," said Alleyne.
    "By our Lady! and withouten disrespect," quoth Terlake, "it is in my  mind that her lady-mother is more fitted to lead a company to a storming  than to have the upbringing of this tender and milk-white maid.
 Hark ye,  lad Alleyne, to what I never told man or woman yet.
 I love the fair Lady  Maude, and would give the last drop of my heart's blood to serve her.
"  He spoke with a gasping voice, and his face flushed crimson in the  moonlight.
    Alleyne said nothing, but his heart seemed to turn to a lump of ice in  his bosom.
    "My father has broad acres," the other continued, "from Fareham Creek to  the slope of the Portsdown Hill.
 There is filling of granges, hewing  of wood, malting of grain, and herding of sheep as much as heart could  wish, and I the only son.
 Sure am I that Sir Nigel would be blithe at  such a match.
"    "But how of the lady?" asked Alleyne, with dry lips.
    "Ah, lad, there lies my trouble.
 It is a toss of the head and a droop of  the eyes if I say one word of what is in my mind.
 'Twere as easy to woo  the snow-dame that we shaped last winter in our castle yard.
 I did but  ask her yesternight for her green veil, that I might bear it as a token  or lambrequin upon my helm; but she flashed out at me that she kept it  for a better man, and then all in a breath asked pardon for that she had  spoke so rudely.
 Yet she would not take back the words either, nor would  she grant the veil.
 Has it seemed to thee, Alleyne, that she loves any  one?"    "Nay, I cannot say," said Alleyne, with a wild throb of sudden hope in  his heart.
    "I have thought so, and yet I cannot name the man.
 Indeed, save myself,  and Walter Ford, and you, who are half a clerk, and Father Christopher  of the Priory, and Bertrand the page, who is there whom she sees?"    "I cannot tell," quoth Alleyne shortly; and the two squires rode on  again, each intent upon his own thoughts.
    Next day at morning lesson the teacher observed that his pupil was  indeed looking pale and jaded, with listless eyes and a weary manner.
 He  was heavy-hearted to note the grievous change in her.
    "Your mistress, I fear, is ill, Agatha," he said to the tire-woman, when  the Lady Maude had sought her chamber.
    The maid looked aslant at him with laughing eyes.
 "It is not an illness  that kills," quoth she.
    "Pray God not!" he cried.
 "But tell me, Agatha, what it is that ails  her?"    "Methinks that I could lay my hand upon another who is smitten with the  same trouble," said she, with the same sidelong look.
 "Canst not give a  name to it, and thou so skilled in leech-craft?"    "Nay, save that she seems aweary.
"    "Well, bethink you that it is but three days ere you will all be gone,  and Castle Twynham be as dull as the Priory.
 Is there not enough there  to cloud a lady's brow?"    "In sooth, yes," he answered; "I had forgot that she is about to lose  her father.
"    "Her father!" cried the tire-woman, with a little trill of laughter.
 "Oh  simple, simple!" And she was off down the passage like arrow from bow,  while Alleyne stood gazing after her, betwixt hope and doubt, scarce  daring to put faith in the meaning which seemed to underlie her words.
        .
 HOW THE WHITE COMPANY SET FORTH TO THE WARS.
      St.
 Luke's day had come and had gone, and it was in the season of  Martinmas, when the oxen are driven in to the slaughter, that the White  Company was ready for its journey.
 Loud shrieked the brazen bugles from  keep and from gateway, and merry was the rattle of the war-drum, as the  men gathered in the outer bailey, with torches to light them, for the  morn had not yet broken.
 Alleyne, from the window of the armory, looked  down upon the strange scene--the circles of yellow flickering light,  the lines of stern and bearded faces, the quick shimmer of arms, and the  lean heads of the horses.
 In front stood the bow-men, ten deep, with a  fringe of under-officers, who paced hither and thither marshalling the  ranks with curt precept or short rebuke.
 Behind were the little clump  of steel-clad horsemen, their lances raised, with long pensils drooping  down the oaken shafts.
 So silent and still were they, that they might  have been metal-sheathed statues, were it not for the occasional quick,  impatient stamp of their chargers, or the rattle of chamfron against  neck-plates as they tossed and strained.
 A spear's length in front of  them sat the spare and long-limbed figure of Black Simon, the Norwich  fighting man, his fierce, deep-lined face framed in steel, and the  silk guidon marked with the five scarlet roses slanting over his right  shoulder.
 All round, in the edge of the circle of the light, stood the  castle servants, the soldiers who were to form the garrison, and little  knots of women, who sobbed in their aprons and called shrilly to their  name-saints to watch over the Wat, or Will, or Peterkin who had turned  his hand to the work of war.
    The young squire was leaning forward, gazing at the stirring and martial  scene, when he heard a short, quick gasp at his shoulder, and there was  the Lady Maude, with her hand to her heart, leaning up against the wall,  slender and fair, like a half-plucked lily.
 Her face was turned away  from him, but he could see, by the sharp intake of her breath, that she  was weeping bitterly.
    "Alas! alas!" he cried, all unnerved at the sight, "why is it that you  are so sad, lady?"    "It is the sight of these brave men," she answered; "and to think how  many of them go and how few are like to find their way back.
 I have seen  it before, when I was a little maid, in the year of the Prince's great  battle.
 I remember then how they mustered in the bailey, even as they do  now, and my lady-mother holding me in her arms at this very window that  I might see the show.
"    "Please God, you will see them all back ere another year be out," said  he.
    She shook her head, looking round at him with flushed cheeks and eyes  that sparkled in the lamp-light.
 "Oh, but I hate myself for being a  woman!" she cried, with a stamp of her little foot.
 "What can I do that  is good? Here I must bide, and talk and sew and spin, and spin and sew  and talk.
 Ever the same dull round, with nothing at the end of it.
 And  now you are going too, who could carry my thoughts out of these gray  walls, and raise my mind above tapestry and distaffs.
 What can I do? I  am of no more use or value than that broken bowstave.
"    "You are of such value to me," he cried, in a whirl of hot, passionate  words, "that all else has become nought.
 You are my heart, my life, my  one and only thought.
 Oh, Maude, I cannot live without you, I cannot  leave you without a word of love.
 All is changed to me since I have  known you.
 I am poor and lowly and all unworthy of you; but if great  love may weigh down such defects, then mine may do it.
 Give me but one  word of hope to take to the wars with me--but one.
 Ah, you shrink, you  shudder! My wild words have frightened you.
"    Twice she opened her lips, and twice no sound came from them.
 At last  she spoke in a hard and measured voice, as one who dare not trust  herself to speak too freely.
    "This is over sudden," she said; "it is not so long since the world was  nothing to you.
 You have changed once; perchance you may change again.
"    "Cruel!" he cried, "who hath changed me?"    "And then your brother," she continued with a little laugh, disregarding  his question.
 "Methinks this hath become a family custom amongst the  Edricsons.
 Nay, I am sorry; I did not mean a jibe.
 But, indeed, Alleyne,  this hath come suddenly upon me, and I scarce know what to say.
"    "Say some word of hope, however distant--some kind word that I may  cherish in my heart.
"    "Nay, Alleyne, it were a cruel kindness, and you have been too good and  true a friend to me that I should use you despitefully.
 There cannot be  a closer link between us.
 It is madness to think of it.
 Were there no  other reasons, it is enough that my father and your brother would both  cry out against it.
"    "My brother, what has he to do with it? And your father----"    "Come, Alleyne, was it not you who would have me act fairly to all men,  and, certes, to my father amongst them?"    "You say truly," he cried, "you say truly.
 But you do not reject me,  Maude? You give me some ray of hope? I do not ask pledge or promise.
 Say  only that I am not hateful to you--that on some happier day I may hear  kinder words from you.
"    Her eyes softened upon him, and a kind answer was on her lips, when a  hoarse shout, with the clatter of arms and stamping of steeds, rose up  from the bailey below.
 At the sound her face set her eyes sparkled, and  she stood with flushed cheek and head thrown back--a woman's body, with  a soul of fire.
    "My father hath gone down," she cried.
 "Your place is by his side.
 Nay,  look not at me, Alleyne.
 It is no time for dallying.
 Win my father's  love, and all may follow.
 It is when the brave soldier hath done his  devoir that he hopes for his reward.
 Farewell, and may God be with you!"  She held out her white, slim hand to him, but as he bent his lips over  it she whisked away and was gone, leaving in his outstretched hand the  very green veil for which poor Peter Terlake had craved in vain.
 Again  the hoarse cheering burst out from below, and he heard the clang of the  rising portcullis.
 Pressing the veil to his lips, he thrust it into the  bosom of his tunic, and rushed as fast as feet could bear him to arm  himself and join the muster.
    The raw morning had broken ere the hot spiced ale had been served round  and the last farewell spoken.
 A cold wind blew up from the sea and  ragged clouds drifted swiftly across the sky.
    The Christchurch townsfolk stood huddled about the Bridge of Avon, the  women pulling tight their shawls and the men swathing themselves in  their gaberdines, while down the winding path from the castle came the  van of the little army, their feet clanging on the hard, frozen road.
  First came Black Simon with his banner, bestriding a lean and powerful  dapple-gray charger, as hard and wiry and warwise as himself.
 After him,  riding three abreast, were nine men-at-arms, all picked soldiers, who  had followed the French wars before, and knew the marches of Picardy as  they knew the downs of their native Hampshire.
 They were armed to the  teeth with lance, sword, and mace, with square shields notched at the  upper right-hand corner to serve as a spear-rest.
 For defence each man  wore a coat of interlaced leathern thongs, strengthened at the shoulder,  elbow, and upper arm with slips of steel.
 Greaves and knee-pieces were  also of leather backed by steel, and their gauntlets and shoes were of  iron plates, craftily jointed.
 So, with jingle of arms and clatter of  hoofs, they rode across the Bridge of Avon, while the burghers shouted  lustily for the flag of the five roses and its gallant guard.
    Close at the heels of the horses came two-score archers bearded and  burly, their round targets on their backs and their long yellow bows,  the most deadly weapon that the wit of man had yet devised, thrusting  forth from behind their shoulders.
 From each man's girdle hung sword or  axe, according to his humor, and over the right hip there jutted out the  leathern quiver with its bristle of goose, pigeon, and peacock feathers.
  Behind the bowmen strode two trumpeters blowing upon nakirs, and two  drummers in parti-colored clothes.
 After them came twenty-seven sumpter  horses carrying tent-poles, cloth, spare arms, spurs, wedges, cooking  kettles, horse-shoes, bags of nails and the hundred other things which  experience had shown to be needful in a harried and hostile country.
 A  white mule with red trappings, led by a varlet, carried Sir Nigel's own  napery and table comforts.
 Then came two-score more archers, ten more  men-at-arms, and finally a rear guard of twenty bowmen, with big John  towering in the front rank and the veteran Aylward marching by the side,  his battered harness and faded surcoat in strange contrast with the  snow-white jupons and shining brigandines of his companions.
 A quick  cross-fire of greetings and questions and rough West Saxon jests flew  from rank to rank, or were bandied about betwixt the marching archers  and the gazing crowd.
    "Hola, Gaffer Higginson!" cried Aylward, as he spied the portly figure  of the village innkeeper.
 "No more of thy nut-brown, mon gar.
 We leave  it behind us.
"    "By St.
 Paul, no!" cried the other.
 "You take it with you.
 Devil a drop  have you left in the great kilderkin.
 It was time for you to go.
"    "If your cask is leer, I warrant your purse is full, gaffer," shouted  Hordle John.
 "See that you lay in good store of the best for our  home-coming.
"    "See that you keep your throat whole for the drinking of it archer,"  cried a voice, and the crowd laughed at the rough pleasantry.
    "If you will warrant the beer, I will warrant the throat," said John  composedly.
    "Close up the ranks!" cried Aylward.
 "En avant, mes enfants! Ah, by my  finger bones, there is my sweet Mary from the Priory Mill! Ma foi, but  she is beautiful! Adieu, Mary ma cherie! Mon coeur est toujours a  toi.
 Brace your belt, Watkins, man, and swing your shoulders as a free  companion should.
 By my hilt! your jerkins will be as dirty as mine ere  you clap eyes on Hengistbury Head again.
"    The Company had marched to the turn of the road ere Sir Nigel Loring  rode out from the gateway, mounted on Pommers, his great black  war-horse, whose ponderous footfall on the wooden drawbridge echoed  loudly from the gloomy arch which spanned it.
 Sir Nigel was still in his  velvet dress of peace, with flat velvet cap of maintenance, and curling  ostrich feather clasped in a golden brooch.
 To his three squires riding  behind him it looked as though he bore the bird's egg as well as its  feather, for the back of his bald pate shone like a globe of ivory.
 He  bore no arms save the long and heavy sword which hung at his saddle-bow;  but Terlake carried in front of him the high wivern-crested bassinet,  Ford the heavy ash spear with swallow-tail pennon, while Alleyne was  entrusted with the emblazoned shield.
 The Lady Loring rode her palfrey  at her lord's bridle-arm, for she would see him as far as the edge  of the forest, and ever and anon she turned her hard-lined face  up wistfully to him and ran a questioning eye over his apparel and  appointments.
    "I trust that there is nothing forgot," she said, beckoning to Alleyne  to ride on her further side.
 "I trust him to you, Edricson.
 Hosen,  shirts, cyclas, and under-jupons are in the brown basket on the left  side of the mule.
 His wine he takes hot when the nights are cold,  malvoisie or vernage, with as much spice as would cover the thumb-nail.
  See that he hath a change if he come back hot from the tilting.
 There is  goose-grease in a box, if the old scars ache at the turn of the weather.
  Let his blankets be dry and----"    "Nay, my heart's life," the little knight interrupted, "trouble not now  about such matters.
 Why so pale and wan, Edricson? Is it not enow  to make a man's heart dance to see this noble Company, such valiant  men-at-arms, such lusty archers? By St.
 Paul! I would be ill to please  if I were not blithe to see the red roses flying at the head of so noble  a following!"    "The purse I have already given you, Edricson," continued the lady.
  "There are in it twenty-three marks, one noble, three shillings and  fourpence, which is a great treasure for one man to carry.
 And I pray  you to bear in mind, Edricson, that he hath two pair of shoes, those of  red leather for common use, and the others with golden toe-chains,  which he may wear should he chance to drink wine with the Prince or with  Chandos.
"    "My sweet bird," said Sir Nigel, "I am right loth to part from you,  but we are now at the fringe of the forest, and it is not right that I  should take the chatelaine too far from her trust.
"    "But oh, my dear lord," she cried with a trembling lip, "let me bide  with you for one furlong further--or one and a half perhaps.
 You may  spare me this out of the weary miles that you will journey along.
"    "Come, then, my heart's comfort," he answered.
 "But I must crave a gage  from thee.
 It is my custom, dearling, and hath been since I have  first known thee, to proclaim by herald in such camps, townships, or  fortalices as I may chance to visit, that my lady-love, being beyond  compare the fairest and sweetest in Christendom, I should deem it great  honor and kindly condescension if any cavalier would run three courses  against me with sharpened lances, should he chance to have a lady whose  claim he was willing to advance.
 I pray you then my fair dove, that you  will vouchsafe to me one of those doeskin gloves, that I may wear it as  the badge of her whose servant I shall ever be.
"    "Alack and alas for the fairest and sweetest!" she cried.
 "Fair and  sweet I would fain be for your dear sake, my lord, but old I am and  ugly, and the knights would laugh should you lay lance in rest in such a  cause.
"    "Edricson," quoth Sir Nigel, "you have young eyes, and mine are somewhat  bedimmed.
 Should you chance to see a knight laugh, or smile, or even,  look you, arch his brows, or purse his mouth, or in any way show  surprise that I should uphold the Lady Mary, you will take particular  note of his name, his coat-armor, and his lodging.
 Your glove, my life's  desire!"    The Lady Mary Loring slipped her hand from her yellow leather gauntlet,  and he, lifting it with dainty reverence, bound it to the front of his  velvet cap.
    "It is with mine other guardian angels," quoth he, pointing at the  saints' medals which hung beside it.
 "And now, my dearest, you have come  far enow.
 May the Virgin guard and prosper thee! One kiss!" He bent down  from his saddle, and then, striking spurs into his horse's sides, he  galloped at top speed after his men, with his three squires at his  heels.
 Half a mile further, where the road topped a hill, they looked  back, and the Lady Mary on her white palfrey was still where they had  left her.
 A moment later they were on the downward slope, and she had  vanished from their view.
        .
 HOW SIR NIGEL SOUGHT FOR A WAYSIDE VENTURE.
      For a time Sir Nigel was very moody and downcast, with bent brows and  eyes upon the pommel of his saddle.
 Edricson and Terlake rode behind him  in little better case, while Ford, a careless and light-hearted youth,  grinned at the melancholy of his companions, and flourished his lord's  heavy spear, making a point to right and a point to left, as though  he were a paladin contending against a host of assailants.
 Sir Nigel  happened, however, to turn himself in his saddle--Ford instantly became  as stiff and as rigid as though he had been struck with a palsy.
 The  four rode alone, for the archers had passed a curve in the road, though  Alleyne could still hear the heavy clump, clump of their marching, or  catch a glimpse of the sparkle of steel through the tangle of leafless  branches.
    "Ride by my side, friends, I entreat of you," said the knight, reining  in his steed that they might come abreast of him.
 "For, since it hath  pleased you to follow me to the wars, it were well that you should know  how you may best serve me.
 I doubt not, Terlake, that you will show  yourself a worthy son of a valiant father; and you, Ford, of yours; and  you, Edricson, that you are mindful of the old-time house from which  all men know that you are sprung.
 And first I would have you bear  very steadfastly in mind that our setting forth is by no means for the  purpose of gaining spoil or exacting ransom, though it may well happen  that such may come to us also.
 We go to France, and from thence I trust  to Spain, in humble search of a field in which we may win advancement  and perchance some small share of glory.
 For this purpose I would have  you know that it is not my wont to let any occasion pass where it is in  any way possible that honor may be gained.
 I would have you bear this  in mind, and give great heed to it that you may bring me word of all  cartels, challenges, wrongs, tyrannies, infamies, and wronging of  damsels.
 Nor is any occasion too small to take note of, for I have  known such trifles as the dropping of a gauntlet, or the flicking of  a breadcrumb, when well and properly followed up, lead to a most noble  spear-running.
 But, Edricson, do I not see a cavalier who rides down  yonder road amongst the nether shaw? It would be well, perchance, that  you should give him greeting from me.
 And, should he be of gentle blood  it may be that he would care to exchange thrusts with me.
"    "Why, my lord," quoth Ford, standing in his stirrups and shading his  eyes, "it is old Hob Davidson, the fat miller of Milton!"    "Ah, so it is, indeed," said Sir Nigel, puckering his cheeks; "but  wayside ventures are not to be scorned, for I have seen no finer  passages than are to be had from such chance meetings, when cavaliers  are willing to advance themselves.
 I can well remember that two leagues  from the town of Rheims I met a very valiant and courteous cavalier of  France, with whom I had gentle and most honorable contention for upwards  of an hour.
 It hath ever grieved me that I had not his name, for he  smote upon me with a mace and went upon his way ere I was in condition  to have much speech with him; but his arms were an allurion in chief  above a fess azure.
 I was also on such an occasion thrust through the  shoulder by Lyon de Montcourt, whom I met on the high road betwixt  Libourne and Bordeaux.
 I met him but the once, but I have never seen  a man for whom I bear a greater love and esteem.
 And so also with the  squire Le Bourg Capillet, who would have been a very valiant captain had  he lived.
"    "He is dead then?" asked Alleyne Edricson.
    "Alas! it was my ill fate to slay him in a bickering which broke out in  a field near the township of Tarbes.
 I cannot call to mind how the  thing came about, for it was in the year of the Prince's ride through  Languedoc, when there was much fine skirmishing to be had at barriers.
  By St.
 Paul! I do not think that any honorable cavalier could ask for  better chance of advancement than might be had by spurring forth before  the army and riding to the gateways of Narbonne, or Bergerac or Mont  Giscar, where some courteous gentleman would ever be at wait to do  what he might to meet your wish or ease you of your vow.
 Such a one at  Ventadour ran three courses with me betwixt daybreak and sunrise, to the  great exaltation of his lady.
"    "And did you slay him also, my lord?" asked Ford with reverence.
    "I could never learn, for he was carried within the barrier, and as I  had chanced to break the bone of my leg it was a great unease for me  to ride or even to stand.
 Yet, by the goodness of heaven and the pious  intercession of the valiant St.
 George, I was able to sit my charger  in the ruffle of Poictiers, which was no very long time afterwards.
 But  what have we here? A very fair and courtly maiden, or I mistake.
"    It was indeed a tall and buxom country lass, with a basket of  spinach-leaves upon her head, and a great slab of bacon tucked under one  arm.
 She bobbed a frightened curtsey as Sir Nigel swept his velvet hat  from his head and reined up his great charger.
    "God be with thee, fair maiden!" said he.
    "God guard thee, my lord!" she answered, speaking in the broadest West  Saxon speech, and balancing herself first on one foot and then on the  other in her bashfulness.
    "Fear not, my fair damsel," said Sir Nigel, "but tell me if perchance  a poor and most unworthy knight can in any wise be of service to you.
  Should it chance that you have been used despitefully, it may be that I  may obtain justice for you.
"    "Lawk no, kind sir," she answered, clutching her bacon the tighter, as  though some design upon it might be hid under this knightly offer.
 "I  be the milking wench o' fairmer Arnold, and he be as kind a maister as  heart could wish.
"    "It is well," said he, and with a shake of the bridle rode on down the  woodland path.
 "I would have you bear in mind," he continued to his  squires, "that gentle courtesy is not, as is the base use of so many  false knights, to be shown only to maidens of high degree, for there  is no woman so humble that a true knight may not listen to her tale of  wrong.
 But here comes a cavalier who is indeed in haste.
 Perchance it  would be well that we should ask him whither he rides, for it may be  that he is one who desires to advance himself in chivalry.
"    The bleak, hard, wind-swept road dipped down in front of them into a  little valley, and then, writhing up the heathy slope upon the other  side, lost itself among the gaunt pine-trees.
 Far away between the black  lines of trunks the quick glitter of steel marked where the Company  pursued its way.
 To the north stretched the tree country, but to the  south, between two swelling downs, a glimpse might be caught of the cold  gray shimmer of the sea, with the white fleck of a galley sail upon the  distant sky-line.
 Just in front of the travellers a horseman was urging  his steed up the slope, driving it on with whip and spur as one who  rides for a set purpose.
 As he clattered up, Alleyne could see that the  roan horse was gray with dust and flecked with foam, as though it had  left many a mile behind it.
 The rider was a stern-faced man, hard of  mouth and dry of eye, with a heavy sword clanking at his side, and a  stiff white bundle swathed in linen balanced across the pommel of his  saddle.
    "The king's messenger," he bawled as he came up to them.
 "The messenger  of the king.
 Clear the causeway for the king's own man.
"    "Not so loudly, friend," quoth the little knight, reining his horse half  round to bar the path.
 "I have myself been the king's man for thirty  years or more, but I have not been wont to halloo about it on a peaceful  highway.
"    "I ride in his service," cried the other, "and I carry that which  belongs to him.
 You bar my path at your peril.
"    "Yet I have known the king's enemies claim to ride in his same," said  Sir Nigel.
 "The foul fiend may lurk beneath a garment of light.
 We must  have some sign or warrant of your mission.
"    "Then must I hew a passage," cried the stranger, with his shoulder  braced round and his hand upon his hilt.
 "I am not to be stopped on the  king's service by every gadabout.
"    "Should you be a gentleman of quarterings and coat-armor," lisped Sir  Nigel, "I shall be very blithe to go further into the matter with you.
  If not, I have three very worthy squires, any one of whom would take the  thing upon himself, and debate it with you in a very honorable way.
"    The man scowled from one to the other, and his hand stole away from his  sword.
    "You ask me for a sign," he said.
 "Here is a sign for you, since you  must have one.
" As he spoke he whirled the covering from the object  in front of him and showed to their horror that it was a newly-severed  human leg.
 "By God's tooth!" he continued, with a brutal laugh, "you ask  me if I am a man of quarterings, and it is even so, for I am officer  to the verderer's court at Lyndhurst.
 This thievish leg is to hang at  Milton, and the other is already at Brockenhurst, as a sign to all men  of what comes of being over-fond of venison pasty.
"    "Faugh!" cried Sir Nigel.
 "Pass on the other side of the road, fellow,  and let us have the wind of you.
 We shall trot our horses, my friends,  across this pleasant valley, for, by Our Lady! a breath of God's fresh  air is right welcome after such a sight.
"    "We hoped to snare a falcon," said he presently, "but we netted a  carrion-crow.
 Ma foi! but there are men whose hearts are tougher than a  boar's hide.
 For me, I have played the old game of war since ever I had  hair on my chin, and I have seen ten thousand brave men in one day with  their faces to the sky, but I swear by Him who made me that I cannot  abide the work of the butcher.
"    "And yet, my fair lord," said Edricson, "there has, from what I hear,  been much of such devil's work in France.
"    "Too much, too much," he answered.
 "But I have ever observed that the  foremost in the field are they who would scorn to mishandle a prisoner.
  By St.
 Paul! it is not they who carry the breach who are wont to sack  the town, but the laggard knaves who come crowding in when a way has  been cleared for them.
 But what is this among the trees?"    "It is a shrine of Our Lady," said Terlake, "and a blind beggar who  lives by the alms of those who worship there.
"    "A shrine!" cried the knight.
 "Then let us put up an orison.
" Pulling  off his cap, and clasping his hands, he chanted in a shrill voice:  "Benedictus dominus Deus meus, qui docet manus meas ad proelium,  et digitos meos ad bellum.
" A strange figure he seemed to his three  squires, perched on his huge horse, with his eyes upturned and the  wintry sun shimmering upon his bald head.
 "It is a noble prayer," he  remarked, putting on his hat again, "and it was taught to me by the  noble Chandos himself.
 But how fares it with you, father? Methinks that  I should have ruth upon you, seeing that I am myself like one who looks  through a horn window while his neighbors have the clear crystal.
 Yet,  by St.
 Paul! there is a long stride between the man who hath a horn  casement and him who is walled in on every hand.
"    "Alas! fair sir," cried the blind old man, "I have not seen the blessed  blue of heaven this two-score years, since a levin flash burned the  sight out of my head.
"    "You have been blind to much that is goodly and fair," quoth Sir Nigel,  "but you have also been spared much that is sorry and foul.
 This very  hour our eyes have been shocked with that which would have left you  unmoved.
 But, by St.
 Paul! we must on, or our Company will think that  they have lost their captain somewhat early in the venture.
 Throw the  man my purse, Edricson, and let us go.
"    Alleyne, lingering behind, bethought him of the Lady Loring's counsel,  and reduced the noble gift which the knight had so freely bestowed to a  single penny, which the beggar with many mumbled blessings thrust away  into his wallet.
 Then, spurring his steed, the young squire rode at the  top of his speed after his companions, and overtook them just at the  spot where the trees fringe off into the moor and the straggling hamlet  of Hordle lies scattered on either side of the winding and deeply-rutted  track.
 The Company was already well-nigh through the village; but, as  the knight and his squires closed up upon them, they heard the clamor of  a strident voice, followed by a roar of deep-chested laughter from  the ranks of the archers.
 Another minute brought them up with the  rear-guard, where every man marched with his beard on his shoulder and a  face which was agrin with merriment.
 By the side of the column walked  a huge red-headed bowman, with his hands thrown out in argument and  expostulation, while close at his heels followed a little wrinkled  woman who poured forth a shrill volley of abuse, varied by an occasional  thwack from her stick, given with all the force of her body, though she  might have been beating one of the forest trees for all the effect that  she seemed likely to produce.
    "I trust, Aylward," said Sir Nigel gravely, as he rode up, "that this  doth not mean that any violence hath been offered to women.
 If such a  thing happened, I tell you that the man shall hang, though he were the  best archer that ever wore brassart.
"    "Nay, my fair lord," Aylward answered with a grin, "it is violence which  is offered to a man.
 He comes from Hordle, and this is his mother who  hath come forth to welcome him.
"    "You rammucky lurden," she was howling, with a blow between each catch  of her breath, "you shammocking, yaping, over-long good-for-nought.
 I  will teach thee! I will baste thee! Aye, by my faith!"    "Whist, mother," said John, looking back at her from the tail of his  eye, "I go to France as an archer to give blows and to take them.
"    "To France, quotha?" cried the old dame.
 "Bide here with me, and I shall  warrant you more blows than you are like to get in France.
 If blows be  what you seek, you need not go further than Hordle.
"    "By my hilt! the good dame speaks truth," said Aylward.
 "It seems to be  the very home of them.
"    "What have you to say, you clean-shaved galley-beggar?" cried the fiery  dame, turning upon the archer.
 "Can I not speak with my own son but you  must let your tongue clack? A soldier, quotha, and never a hair on  his face.
 I have seen a better soldier with pap for food and swaddling  clothes for harness.
"    "Stand to it, Aylward," cried the archers, amid a fresh burst of  laughter.
    "Do not thwart her, comrade," said big John.
 "She hath a proper spirit  for her years and cannot abide to be thwarted.
 It is kindly and homely  to me to hear her voice and to feel that she is behind me.
 But I must  leave you now, mother, for the way is over-rough for your feet; but I  will bring you back a silken gown, if there be one in France or Spain,  and I will bring Jinny a silver penny; so good-bye to you, and God have  you in His keeping!" Whipping up the little woman, he lifted her lightly  to his lips, and then, taking his place in the ranks again, marched on  with the laughing Company.
    "That was ever his way," she cried, appealing to Sir Nigel, who reined  up his horse and listened with the greatest courtesy.
 "He would jog on  his own road for all that I could do to change him.
 First he must be a  monk forsooth, and all because a wench was wise enough to turn her back  on him.
 Then he joins a rascally crew and must needs trapse off to the  wars, and me with no one to bait the fire if I be out, or tend the cow  if I be home.
 Yet I have been a good mother to him.
 Three hazel switches  a day have I broke across his shoulders, and he takes no more notice  than you have seen him to-day.
"    "Doubt not that he will come back to you both safe and prosperous, my  fair dame," quoth Sir Nigel.
 "Meanwhile it grieves me that as I have  already given my purse to a beggar up the road I----"    "Nay, my lord," said Alleyne, "I still have some moneys remaining.
"    "Then I pray you to give them to this very worthy woman.
" He cantered  on as he spoke, while Alleyne, having dispensed two more pence, left  the old dame standing by the furthest cottage of Hordle, with her shrill  voice raised in blessings instead of revilings.
    There were two cross-roads before they reached the Lymington Ford, and  at each of then Sir Nigel pulled up his horse, and waited with many a  curvet and gambade, craning his neck this way and that to see if fortune  would send him a venture.
 Crossroads had, as he explained, been rare  places for knightly spear-runnings, and in his youth it was no uncommon  thing for a cavalier to abide for weeks at such a point, holding gentle  debate with all comers, to his own advancement and the great honor of  his lady.
 The times were changed, however, and the forest tracks wound  away from them deserted and silent, with no trample of war-horse or  clang of armor which might herald the approach of an adversary--so that  Sir Nigel rode on his way disconsolate.
 At the Lymington River they  splashed through the ford, and lay in the meadows on the further side to  eat the bread and salt meat which they carried upon the sumpter horses.
  Then, ere the sun was on the slope of the heavens, they had deftly  trussed up again, and were swinging merrily upon their way, two hundred  feet moving like two.
    There is a third cross-road where the track from Boldre runs down to the  old fishing village of Pitt's Deep.
 Down this, as they came abreast of  it, there walked two men, the one a pace or two behind the other.
 The  cavaliers could not but pull up their horses to look at them, for a  stranger pair were never seen journeying together.
 The first was a  misshapen, squalid man with cruel, cunning eyes and a shock of tangled  red hair, bearing in his hands a small unpainted cross, which he held  high so that all men might see it.
 He seemed to be in the last extremity  of fright, with a face the color of clay and his limbs all ashake as one  who hath an ague.
 Behind him, with his toe ever rasping upon the other's  heels, there walked a very stern, black-bearded man with a hard eye and  a set mouth.
 He bore over his shoulder a great knotted stick with three  jagged nails stuck in the head of it, and from time to time he whirled  it up in the air with a quivering arm, as though he could scarce hold  back from dashing his companion's brains out.
 So in silence they walked  under the spread of the branches on the grass-grown path from Boldre.
    "By St.
 Paul!" quoth the knight, "but this is a passing strange sight,  and perchance some very perilous and honorable venture may arise from  it.
 I pray you, Edricson, to ride up to them and to ask them the cause  of it.
"    There was no need, however, for him to move, for the twain came swiftly  towards them until they were within a spear's length, when the man  with the cross sat himself down sullenly upon a tussock of grass by the  wayside, while the other stood beside him with his great cudgel still  hanging over his head.
 So intent was he that he raised his eyes neither  to knight nor squires, but kept them ever fixed with a savage glare upon  his comrade.
    "I pray you, friend," said Sir Nigel, "to tell us truthfully who you  are, and why you follow this man with such bitter enmity?"    "So long as I am within the pale of the king's law," the stranger  answered, "I cannot see why I should render account to every passing  wayfarer.
"    "You are no very shrewd reasoner, fellow," quoth the knight; "for if  it be within the law for you to threaten him with your club, then it is  also lawful for me to threaten you with my sword.
"    The man with the cross was down in an instant on his knees upon the  ground, with hands clasped above him and his face shining with hope.
  "For dear Christ's sake, my fair lord," he cried in a crackling voice,  "I have at my belt a bag with a hundred rose nobles, and I will give it  to you freely if you will but pass your sword through this man's body.
"    "How, you foul knave?" exclaimed Sir Nigel hotly.
 "Do you think that  a cavalier's arm is to be bought like a packman's ware.
 By St.
 Paul! I  have little doubt that this fellow hath some very good cause to hold you  in hatred.
"    "Indeed, my fair sir, you speak sooth," quoth he with the club, while  the other seated himself once more by the wayside.
 "For this man is  Peter Peterson, a very noted rieve, draw-latch, and murtherer, who has  wrought much evil for many years in the parts about Winchester.
 It was  but the other day, upon the feasts of the blessed Simon and Jude, that  he slew my younger brother William in Bere Forest--for which, by the  black thorn of Glastonbury! I shall have his heart's blood, though I  walk behind him to the further end of earth.
"    "But if this be indeed so," asked Sir Nigel, "why is it that you have  come with him so far through the forest?"    "Because I am an honest Englishman, and will take no more than the law  allows.
 For when the deed was done this foul and base wretch fled to  sanctuary at St.
 Cross, and I, as you may think, after him with all  the posse.
 The prior, however, hath so ordered that while he holds this  cross no man may lay hand upon him without the ban of church, which  heaven forfend from me or mine.
 Yet, if for an instant he lay the cross  aside, or if he fail to journey to Pitt's Deep, where it is ordered that  he shall take ship to outland parts, or if he take not the first ship,  or if until the ship be ready he walk not every day into the sea as far  as his loins, then he becomes outlaw, and I shall forthwith dash out his  brains.
"    At this the man on the ground snarled up at him like a rat, while the  other clenched his teeth, and shook his club, and looked down at him  with murder in his eyes.
 Knight and squire gazed from rogue to avenger,  but as it was a matter which none could mend they tarried no longer, but  rode upon their way.
 Alleyne, looking back, saw that the murderer had  drawn bread and cheese from his scrip, and was silently munching it,  with the protecting cross still hugged to his breast, while the other,  black and grim, stood in the sunlit road and threw his dark shadow  athwart him.
        .
 HOW THE YELLOW COG SAILED FORTH FROM LEPE.
      That night the Company slept at St.
 Leonard's, in the great monastic  barns and spicarium--ground well known both to Alleyne and to John, for  they were almost within sight of the Abbey of Beaulieu.
 A strange thrill  it gave to the young squire to see the well-remembered white dress once  more, and to hear the measured tolling of the deep vespers bell.
  At early dawn they passed across the broad, sluggish, reed-girt  stream--men, horses, and baggage in the flat ferry barges--and so  journeyed on through the fresh morning air past Exbury to Lepe.
  Topping the heathy down, they came of a sudden full in sight of the old  sea-port--a cluster of houses, a trail of blue smoke, and a bristle of  masts.
 To right and left the long blue curve of the Solent lapped in a  fringe of foam upon the yellow beach.
 Some way out from the town a line  of pessoners, creyers, and other small craft were rolling lazily on the  gentle swell.
 Further out still lay a great merchant-ship, high ended,  deep waisted, painted of a canary yellow, and towering above the  fishing-boats like a swan among ducklings.
    "By St.
 Paul!" said the knight, "our good merchant of Southampton hath  not played us false, for methinks I can see our ship down yonder.
 He  said that she would be of great size and of a yellow shade.
"    "By my hilt, yes!" muttered Aylward; "she is yellow as a kite's claw,  and would carry as many men as there are pips in a pomegranate.
"    "It is as well," remarked Terlake; "for methinks, my fair lord, that  we are not the only ones who are waiting a passage to Gascony.
 Mine eye  catches at times a flash and sparkle among yonder houses which assuredly  never came from shipman's jacket or the gaberdine of a burgher.
"    "I can also see it," said Alleyne, shading his eyes with his hand.
 "And  I can see men-at-arms in yonder boats which ply betwixt the vessel and  the shore.
 But methinks that we are very welcome here, for already they  come forth to meet us.
"    A tumultuous crowd of fishermen, citizens, and women had indeed swarmed  out from the northern gate, and approached them up the side of the moor,  waving their hands and dancing with joy, as though a great fear had been  rolled back from their minds.
 At their head rode a very large and solemn  man with a long chin and a drooping lip.
 He wore a fur tippet round his  neck and a heavy gold chain over it, with a medallion which dangled in  front of him.
    "Welcome, most puissant and noble lord," he cried, doffing his bonnet  to Black Simon.
 "I have heard of your lordship's valiant deeds, and in  sooth they might be expected from your lordship's face and bearing.
 Is  there any small matter in which I may oblige you?"    "Since you ask me," said the man-at-arms, "I would take it kindly if you  could spare a link or two of the chain which hangs round your neck.
"    "What, the corporation chain!" cried the other in horror.
 "The ancient  chain of the township of Lepe! This is but a sorry jest, Sir Nigel.
"    "What the plague did you ask me for then?" said Simon.
 "But if it is  Sir Nigel Loring with whom you would speak, that is he upon the black  horse.
"    The Mayor of Lepe gazed with amazement on the mild face and slender  frame of the famous warrior.
    "Your pardon, my gracious lord," he cried.
 "You see in me the mayor and  chief magistrate of the ancient and powerful town of Lepe.
 I bid you  very heartily welcome, and the more so as you are come at a moment when  we are sore put to it for means of defence.
"    "Ha!" cried Sir Nigel, pricking up his ears.
    "Yes, my lord, for the town being very ancient and the walls as old  as the town, it follows that they are very ancient too.
 But there is a  certain villainous and bloodthirsty Norman pirate hight Tete-noire, who,  with a Genoan called Tito Caracci, commonly known as Spade-beard, hath  been a mighty scourge upon these coasts.
 Indeed, my lord, they are very  cruel and black-hearted men, graceless and ruthless, and if they should  come to the ancient and powerful town of Lepe then--"    "Then good-bye to the ancient and powerful town of Lepe," quoth Ford,  whose lightness of tongue could at times rise above his awe of Sir  Nigel.
    The knight, however, was too much intent upon the matter in hand to give  heed to the flippancy of his squire.
 "Have you then cause," he asked,  "to think that these men are about to venture an attempt upon you?"    "They have come in two great galleys," answered the mayor, "with two  bank of oars on either side, and great store of engines of war and  of men-at-arms.
 At Weymouth and at Portland they have murdered and  ravished.
 Yesterday morning they were at Cowes, and we saw the smoke  from the burning crofts.
 To-day they lie at their ease near Freshwater,  and we fear much lest they come upon us and do us a mischief.
"    "We cannot tarry," said Sir Nigel, riding towards the town, with the  mayor upon his left side; "the Prince awaits us at Bordeaux, and we may  not be behind the general muster.
 Yet I will promise you that on our way  we shall find time to pass Freshwater and to prevail upon these rovers  to leave you in peace.
"    "We are much beholden to you!" cried the mayor "But I cannot see, my  lord, how, without a war-ship, you may venture against these men.
 With  your archers, however, you might well hold the town and do them great  scath if they attempt to land.
"    "There is a very proper cog out yonder," said Sir Nigel, "it would be a  very strange thing if any ship were not a war-ship when it had such men  as these upon her decks.
 Certes, we shall do as I say, and that no later  than this very day.
"    "My lord," said a rough-haired, dark-faced man, who walked by the  knight's other stirrup, with his head sloped to catch all that he was  saying.
 "By your leave, I have no doubt that you are skilled in land  fighting and the marshalling of lances, but, by my soul! you will find  it another thing upon the sea.
 I am the master-shipman of this yellow  cog, and my name is Goodwin Hawtayne.
 I have sailed since I was as high  as this staff, and I have fought against these Normans and against the  Genoese, as well as the Scotch, the Bretons, the Spanish, and the Moors.
  I tell you, sir, that my ship is over light and over frail for such  work, and it will but end in our having our throats cut, or being sold  as slaves to the Barbary heathen.
"    "I also have experienced one or two gentle and honorable ventures upon  the sea," quoth Sir Nigel, "and I am right blithe to have so fair a task  before us.
 I think, good master-shipman, that you and I may win great  honor in this matter, and I can see very readily that you are a brave  and stout man.
"    "I like it not," said the other sturdily.
 "In God's name, I like it not.
  And yet Goodwin Hawtayne is not the man to stand back when his fellows  are for pressing forward.
 By my soul! be it sink or swim, I shall  turn her beak into Freshwater Bay, and if good Master Witherton, of  Southampton, like not my handling of his ship then he may find another  master-shipman.
"    They were close by the old north gate of the little town, and Alleyne,  half turning in his saddle, looked back at the motley crowd who  followed.
 The bowmen and men-at-arms had broken their ranks and were  intermingled with the fishermen and citizens, whose laughing faces  and hearty gestures bespoke the weight of care from which this welcome  arrival had relieved them.
 Here and there among the moving throng of  dark jerkins and of white surcoats were scattered dashes of scarlet and  blue, the whimples or shawls of the women.
 Aylward, with a fishing lass  on either arm, was vowing constancy alternately to her on the right and  her on the left, while big John towered in the rear with a little chubby  maiden enthroned upon his great shoulder, her soft white arm curled  round his shining headpiece.
 So the throng moved on, until at the very  gate it was brought to a stand by a wondrously fat man, who came darting  forth from the town with rage in every feature of his rubicund face.
    "How now, Sir Mayor?" he roared, in a voice like a bull.
 "How now, Sir  Mayor? How of the clams and the scallops?"    "By Our Lady! my sweet Sir Oliver," cried the mayor.
 "I have had so much  to think of, with these wicked villains so close upon us, that it had  quite gone out of my head.
"    "Words, words!" shouted the other furiously.
 "Am I to be put off with  words? I say to you again, how of the clams and scallops?"    "My fair sir, you flatter me," cried the mayor.
 "I am a peaceful trader,  and I am not wont to be so shouted at upon so small a matter.
"    "Small!" shrieked the other.
 "Small! Clams and scallops! Ask me to your  table to partake of the dainty of the town, and when I come a barren  welcome and a bare board! Where is my spear-bearer?"    "Nay, Sir Oliver, Sir Oliver!" cried Sir Nigel, laughing.
    "Let your anger be appeased, since instead of this dish you come upon an  old friend and comrade.
"    "By St.
 Martin of Tours!" shouted the fat knight, his wrath all changed  in an instant to joy, "if it is not my dear little game rooster of the  Garonne.
 Ah, my sweet coz, I am right glad to see you.
 What days we have  seen together!"    "Aye, by my faith," cried Sir Nigel, with sparkling eyes, "we have  seen some valiant men, and we have shown our pennons in some noble  skirmishes.
 By St.
 Paul! we have had great joys in France.
"    "And sorrows also," quoth the other.
 "I have some sad memories of the  land.
 Can you recall that which befell us at Libourne?"    "Nay, I cannot call to mind that we ever so much as drew sword at the  place.
"    "Man, man," cried Sir Oliver, "your mind still runs on nought but blades  and bassinets.
 Hast no space in thy frame for the softer joys.
 Ah,  even now I can scarce speak of it unmoved.
 So noble a pie, such tender  pigeons, and sugar in the gravy instead of salt! You were by my side  that day, as were Sir Claude Latour and the Lord of Pommers.
"    "I remember it," said Sir Nigel, laughing, "and how you harried the cook  down the street, and spoke of setting fire to the inn.
 By St.
 Paul! most  worthy mayor, my old friend is a perilous man, and I rede you that you  compose your difference with him on such terms as you may.
"    "The clams and scallops shall be ready within the hour," the mayor  answered.
 "I had asked Sir Oliver Buttesthorn to do my humble board  the honor to partake at it of the dainty upon which we take some little  pride, but in sooth this alarm of pirates hath cast such a shadow on my  wits that I am like one distrait.
 But I trust, Sir Nigel, that you will  also partake of none-meat with me?"    "I have overmuch to do," Sir Nigel answered, "for we must be aboard,  horse and man, as early as we may.
 How many do you muster, Sir Oliver?"    "Three and forty.
 The forty are drunk, and the three are but indifferent  sober.
 I have them all safe upon the ship.
"    "They had best find their wits again, for I shall have work for every  man of them ere the sun set.
 It is my intention, if it seems good to  you, to try a venture against these Norman and Genoese rovers.
"    "They carry caviare and certain very noble spices from the Levant aboard  of ships from Genoa," quoth Sir Oliver.
 "We may come to great profit  through the business.
 I pray you, master-shipman, that when you go on  board you pour a helmetful of sea-water over any of my rogues whom you  may see there.
"    Leaving the lusty knight and the Mayor of Lepe, Sir Nigel led the  Company straight down to the water's edge, where long lines of flat  lighters swiftly bore them to their vessel.
 Horse after horse was slung  by main force up from the barges, and after kicking and plunging in  empty air was dropped into the deep waist of the yellow cog, where rows  of stalls stood ready for their safe keeping.
 Englishmen in those days  were skilled and prompt in such matters, for it was so not long before  that Edward had embarked as many as fifty thousand men in the port  of Orwell, with their horses and their baggage, all in the space of  four-and-twenty hours.
 So urgent was Sir Nigel on the shore, and so  prompt was Goodwin Hawtayne on the cog, that Sir Oliver Buttesthorn had  scarce swallowed his last scallop ere the peal of the trumpet and clang  of nakir announced that all was ready and the anchor drawn.
 In the last  boat which left the shore the two commanders sat together in the sheets,  a strange contrast to one another, while under the feet of the rowers  was a litter of huge stones which Sir Nigel had ordered to be carried to  the cog.
 These once aboard, the ship set her broad mainsail, purple  in color, and with a golden St.
 Christopher bearing Christ upon his  shoulder in the centre of it.
 The breeze blew, the sail bellied, over  heeled the portly vessel, and away she plunged through the smooth blue  rollers, amid the clang of the minstrels on her poop and the shouting of  the black crowd who fringed the yellow beach.
 To the left lay the green  Island of Wight, with its long, low, curving hills peeping over each  other's shoulders to the sky-line; to the right the wooded Hampshire  coast as far as eye could reach; above a steel-blue heaven, with a  wintry sun shimmering down upon them, and enough of frost to set the  breath a-smoking.
    "By St.
 Paul!" said Sir Nigel gayly, as he stood upon the poop and  looked on either side of him, "it is a land which is very well worth  fighting for, and it were pity to go to France for what may be had at  home.
 Did you not spy a crooked man upon the beach?"    "Nay, I spied nothing," grumbled Sir Oliver, "for I was hurried down  with a clam stuck in my gizzard and an untasted goblet of Cyprus on the  board behind me.
"    "I saw him, my fair lord," said Terlake, "an old man with one shoulder  higher than the other.
"    "'Tis a sign of good fortune," quoth Sir Nigel.
 "Our path was also  crossed by a woman and by a priest, so all should be well with us.
 What  say you, Edricson?"    "I cannot tell, my fair lord.
 The Romans of old were a very wise people,  yet, certes, they placed their faith in such matters.
 So, too, did  the Greeks, and divers other ancient peoples who were famed for their  learning.
 Yet of the moderns there are many who scoff at all omens.
"    "There can be no manner of doubt about it," said Sir Oliver Buttesthorn.
  "I can well remember that in Navarre one day it thundered on the left  out of a cloudless sky.
 We knew that ill would come of it, nor had we  long to wait.
 Only thirteen days after, a haunch of prime venison was  carried from my very tent door by the wolves, and on the same day two  flasks of old vernage turned sour and muddy.
"    "You may bring my harness from below," said Sir Nigel to his squires,  "and also, I pray you, bring up Sir Oliver's and we shall don it here.
  Ye may then see to your own gear; for this day you will, I hope, make a  very honorable entrance into the field of chivalry, and prove yourselves  to be very worthy and valiant squires.
 And now, Sir Oliver, as to our  dispositions: would it please you that I should order them or will you?"    "You, my cockerel, you.
 By Our Lady! I am no chicken, but I cannot claim  to know as much of war as the squire of Sir Walter Manny.
 Settle the  matter to your own liking.
"    "You shall fly your pennon upon the fore part, then, and I upon the  poop.
 For foreguard I shall give you your own forty men, with two-score  archers.
 Two-score men, with my own men-at-arms and squires, will serve  as a poop-guard.
 Ten archers, with thirty shipmen, under the master, may  hold the waist while ten lie aloft with stones and arbalests.
 How like  you that?"    "Good, by my faith, good! But here comes my harness, and I must to work,  for I cannot slip into it as I was wont when first I set my face to the  wars.
"    Meanwhile there had been bustle and preparation in all parts of the  great vessel.
 The archers stood in groups about the decks, new-stringing  their bows, and testing that they were firm at the nocks.
 Among them  moved Aylward and other of the older soldiers, with a few whispered  words of precept here and of warning there.
    "Stand to it, my hearts of gold," said the old bowman as he passed from  knot to knot.
 "By my hilt! we are in luck this journey.
 Bear in mind the  old saying of the Company.
"    "What is that, Aylward?" cried several, leaning on their bows and  laughing at him.
    "'Tis the master-bowyer's rede: 'Every bow well bent.
 Every shaft well  sent.
 Every stave well nocked.
 Every string well locked.
' There, with  that jingle in his head, a bracer on his left hand, a shooting glove on  his right, and a farthing's-worth of wax in his girdle, what more doth a  bowman need?"    "It would not be amiss," said Hordle John, "if under his girdle he had  four farthings'-worth of wine.
"    "Work first, wine afterwards, mon camarade.
 But it is time that we  took our order, for methinks that between the Needle rocks and the Alum  cliffs yonder I can catch a glimpse of the topmasts of the galleys.
  Hewett, Cook, Johnson, Cunningham, your men are of the poop-guard.
  Thornbury, Walters, Hackett, Baddlesmere, you are with Sir Oliver on the  forecastle.
 Simon, you bide with your lord's banner; but ten men must go  forward.
"    Quietly and promptly the men took their places, lying flat upon their  faces on the deck, for such was Sir Nigel's order.
 Near the prow was  planted Sir Oliver's spear, with his arms--a boar's head gules upon a  field of gold.
 Close by the stern stood Black Simon with the pennon of  the house of Loring.
 In the waist gathered the Southampton mariners,  hairy and burly men, with their jerkins thrown off, their waists braced  tight, swords, mallets, and pole-axes in their hands.
 Their leader,  Goodwin Hawtayne, stood upon the poop and talked with Sir Nigel, casting  his eye up sometimes at the swelling sail, and then glancing back at the  two seamen who held the tiller.
    "Pass the word," said Sir Nigel, "that no man shall stand to arms or  draw his bow-string until my trumpeter shall sound.
 It would be well  that we should seem to be a merchant-ship from Southampton and appear to  flee from them.
"    "We shall see them anon," said the master-shipman.
 "Ha, said I not so?  There they lie, the water-snakes, in Freshwater Bay; and mark the reek  of smoke from yonder point, where they have been at their devil's work.
  See how their shallops pull from the land! They have seen us and called  their men aboard.
 Now they draw upon the anchor.
 See them like ants upon  the forecastle! They stoop and heave like handy ship men.
 But, my fair  lord, these are no niefs.
 I doubt but we have taken in hand more than  we can do.
 Each of these ships is a galeasse, and of the largest and  swiftest make.
"    "I would I had your eyes," said Sir Nigel, blinking at the pirate  galleys.
 "They seem very gallant ships, and I trust that we shall have  much pleasance from our meeting with them.
 It would be well to pass the  word that we should neither give nor take quarter this day.
 Have you  perchance a priest or friar aboard this ship, Master Hawtayne?"    "No, my fair lord.
"    "Well, well, it is no great matter for my Company, for they were all  houseled and shriven ere we left Twynham Castle; and Father Christopher  of the Priory gave me his word that they were as fit to march to heaven  as to Gascony.
 But my mind misdoubts me as to these Winchester men who  have come with Sir Oliver, for they appear to be a very ungodly crew.
  Pass the word that the men kneel, and that the under-officers repeat to  them the pater, the ave, and the credo.
"    With a clank of arms, the rough archers and seamen took to their knees,  with bent heads and crossed hands, listening to the hoarse mutter from  the file-leaders.
 It was strange to mark the hush; so that the lapping  of the water, the straining of the sail, and the creaking of the timbers  grew louder of a sudden upon the ear.
 Many of the bowmen had drawn  amulets and relics from their bosoms, while he who possessed some  more than usually sanctified treasure passed it down the line of his  comrades, that all might kiss and reap the virtue.
    The yellow cog had now shot out from the narrow waters of the Solent,  and was plunging and rolling on the long heave of the open channel.
 The  wind blew freshly from the east, with a very keen edge to it; and the  great sail bellied roundly out, laying the vessel over until the water  hissed beneath her lee bulwarks.
 Broad and ungainly, she floundered from  wave to wave, dipping her round bows deeply into the blue rollers, and  sending the white flakes of foam in a spatter over her decks.
 On her  larboard quarter lay the two dark galleys, which had already hoisted  sail, and were shooting out from Freshwater Bay in swift pursuit, their  double line of oars giving them a vantage which could not fail to bring  them up with any vessel which trusted to sails alone.
 High and bluff the  English cog; long, black and swift the pirate galleys, like two fierce  lean wolves which have seen a lordly and unsuspecting stag walk past  their forest lair.
    "Shall we turn, my fair lord, or shall we carry on?" asked the  master-shipman, looking behind him with anxious eyes.
    "Nay, we must carry on and play the part of the helpless merchant.
"    "But your pennons? They will see that we have two knights with us.
"    "Yet it would not be to a knight's honor or good name to lower his  pennon.
 Let them be, and they will think that we are a wine-ship for  Gascony, or that we bear the wool-bales of some mercer of the Staple.
 Ma  foi, but they are very swift! They swoop upon us like two goshawks on a  heron.
 Is there not some symbol or device upon their sails?"    "That on the right," said Edricson, "appears to have the head of an  Ethiop upon it.
"    "'Tis the badge of Tete-noire, the Norman," cried a seaman-mariner.
 "I  have seen it before, when he harried us at Winchelsea.
 He is a wondrous  large and strong man, with no ruth for man, woman, or beast.
 They say  that he hath the strength of six; and, certes, he hath the crimes of six  upon his soul.
 See, now, to the poor souls who swing at either end of  his yard-arm!"    At each end of the yard there did indeed hang the dark figure of a man,  jolting and lurching with hideous jerkings of its limbs at every plunge  and swoop of the galley.
    "By St.
 Paul!" said Sir Nigel, "and by the help of St.
 George and Our  Lady, it will be a very strange thing if our black-headed friend does  not himself swing thence ere he be many hours older.
 But what is that  upon the other galley?"    "It is the red cross of Genoa.
 This Spade-beard is a very noted captain,  and it is his boast that there are no seamen and no archers in the world  who can compare with those who serve the Doge Boccanegra.
"    "That we shall prove," said Goodwin Hawtayne; "but it would be well,  ere they close with us, to raise up the mantlets and pavises as a screen  against their bolts.
" He shouted a hoarse order, and his seamen worked  swiftly and silently, heightening the bulwarks and strengthening them.
  The three ship's anchors were at Sir Nigel's command carried into the  waist, and tied to the mast, with twenty feet of cable between, each  under the care of four seamen.
 Eight others were stationed with leather  water-bags to quench any fire-arrows which might come aboard, while  others were sent up the mast, to lie along the yard and drop stones or  shoot arrows as the occasion served.
    "Let them be supplied with all that is heavy and weighty in the ship,"  said Sir Nigel.
    "Then we must send them up Sir Oliver Buttesthorn," quoth Ford.
    The knight looked at him with a face which struck the smile from his  lips.
 "No squire of mine," he said, "shall ever make jest of a belted  knight.
 And yet," he added, his eyes softening, "I know that it is but  a boy's mirth, with no sting in it.
 Yet I should ill do my part towards  your father if I did not teach you to curb your tongue-play.
"    "They will lay us aboard on either quarter, my lord," cried the master.
  "See how they stretch out from each other! The Norman hath a mangonel  or a trabuch upon the forecastle.
 See, they bend to the levers! They are  about to loose it.
"    "Aylward," cried the knight, "pick your three trustiest archers, and see  if you cannot do something to hinder their aim.
 Methinks they are within  long arrow flight.
"    "Seventeen score paces," said the archer, running his eye backwards and  forwards.
 "By my ten finger-bones! it would be a strange thing if we  could not notch a mark at that distance.
 Here, Watkin of Sowley, Arnold,  Long Williams, let us show the rogues that they have English bowmen to  deal with.
"    The three archers named stood at the further end of the poop, balancing  themselves with feet widely spread and bows drawn, until the heads of  the cloth-yard arrows were level with the centre of the stave.
 "You  are the surer, Watkin," said Aylward, standing by them with shaft upon  string.
 "Do you take the rogue with the red coif.
 You two bring down the  man with the head-piece, and I will hold myself ready if you miss.
 Ma  foi! they are about to loose her.
 Shoot, mes garcons, or you will be too  late.
"    The throng of pirates had cleared away from the great wooden catapult,  leaving two of their number to discharge it.
 One in a scarlet cap  bent over it, steadying the jagged rock which was balanced on the  spoon-shaped end of the long wooden lever.
 The other held the loop of  the rope which would release the catch and send the unwieldy missile  hurtling through the air.
 So for an instant they stood, showing hard and  clear against the white sail behind them.
 The next, redcap had fallen  across the stone with an arrow between his ribs; and the other, struck  in the leg and in the throat, was writhing and spluttering upon the  ground.
 As he toppled backwards he had loosed the spring, and the huge  beam of wood, swinging round with tremendous force, cast the corpse of  his comrade so close to the English ship that its mangled and distorted  limbs grazed their very stern.
 As to the stone, it glanced off obliquely  and fell midway between the vessels.
 A roar of cheering and of laughter  broke from the rough archers and seamen at the sight, answered by a yell  of rage from their pursuers.
    "Lie low, mes enfants," cried Aylward, motioning with his left hand.
  "They will learn wisdom.
 They are bringing forward shield and mantlet.
  We shall have some pebbles about our ears ere long.
"        .
 HOW THE YELLOW COG FOUGHT THE TWO ROVER GALLEYS.
      The three vessels had been sweeping swiftly westwards, the cog still  well to the front, although the galleys were slowly drawing in upon  either quarter.
 To the left was a hard skyline unbroken by a sail.
 The  island already lay like a cloud behind them, while right in front  was St.
 Alban's Head, with Portland looming mistily in the farthest  distance.
 Alleyne stood by the tiller, looking backwards, the fresh wind  full in his teeth, the crisp winter air tingling on his face and blowing  his yellow curls from under his bassinet.
 His cheeks were flushed and  his eyes shining, for the blood of a hundred fighting Saxon ancestors  was beginning to stir in his veins.
    "What was that?" he asked, as a hissing, sharp-drawn voice seemed to  whisper in his ear.
 The steersman smiled, and pointed with his foot to  where a short heavy cross-bow quarrel stuck quivering in the boards.
  At the same instant the man stumbled forward upon his knees, and lay  lifeless upon the deck, a blood-stained feather jutting out from his  back.
 As Alleyne stooped to raise him, the air seemed to be alive with  the sharp zip-zip of the bolts, and he could hear them pattering on the  deck like apples at a tree-shaking.
    "Raise two more mantlets by the poop-lanthorn," said Sir Nigel quietly.
    "And another man to the tiller," cried the master-shipman.
    "Keep them in play, Aylward, with ten of your men," the knight  continued.
 "And let ten of Sir Oliver's bowmen do as much for the  Genoese.
 I have no mind as yet to show them how much they have to fear  from us.
"    Ten picked shots under Aylward stood in line across the broad deck, and  it was a lesson to the young squires who had seen nothing of war to note  how orderly and how cool were these old soldiers, how quick the command,  and how prompt the carrying out, ten moving like one.
 Their comrades  crouched beneath the bulwarks, with many a rough jest and many a scrap  of criticism or advice.
 "Higher, Wat, higher!" "Put thy body into it,  Will!" "Forget not the wind, Hal!" So ran the muttered chorus, while  high above it rose the sharp twanging of the strings, the hiss of the  shafts, and the short "Draw your arrow! Nick your arrow! Shoot wholly  together!" from the master-bowman.
    And now both mangonels were at work from the galleys, but so covered  and protected that, save at the moment of discharge, no glimpse could  be caught of them.
 A huge brown rock from the Genoese sang over their  heads, and plunged sullenly into the slope of a wave.
 Another from the  Norman whizzed into the waist, broke the back of a horse, and crashed  its way through the side of the vessel.
 Two others, flying together,  tore a great gap in the St.
 Christopher upon the sail, and brushed three  of Sir Oliver's men-at-arms from the forecastle.
 The master-shipman  looked at the knight with a troubled face.
    "They keep their distance from us," said he.
 "Our archery is over-good,  and they will not close.
 What defence can we make against the stones?"    "I think I may trick them," the knight answered cheerfully, and passed  his order to the archers.
 Instantly five of them threw up their hands  and fell prostrate upon the deck.
 One had already been slain by a bolt,  so that there were but four upon their feet.
    "That should give them heart," said Sir Nigel, eyeing the galleys, which  crept along on either side, with a slow, measured swing of their great  oars, the water swirling and foaming under their sharp stems.
    "They still hold aloof," cried Hawtayne.
    "Then down with two more," shouted their leader.
 "That will do.
 Ma foi!  but they come to our lure like chicks to the fowler.
 To your arms, men!  The pennon behind me, and the squires round the pennon.
 Stand fast with  the anchors in the waist, and be ready for a cast.
 Now blow out the  trumpets, and may God's benison be with the honest men!"    As he spoke a roar of voices and a roll of drums came from either  galley, and the water was lashed into spray by the hurried beat of a  hundred oars.
 Down they swooped, one on the right, one on the left, the  sides and shrouds black with men and bristling with weapons.
 In heavy  clusters they hung upon the forecastle all ready for a spring--faces  white, faces brown, faces yellow, and faces black, fair Norsemen,  swarthy Italians, fierce rovers from the Levant, and fiery Moors from  the Barbary States, of all hues and countries, and marked solely by the  common stamp of a wild-beast ferocity.
 Rasping up on either side,  with oars trailing to save them from snapping, they poured in a  living torrent with horrid yell and shrill whoop upon the defenceless  merchantman.
    But wilder yet was the cry, and shriller still the scream, when there  rose up from the shadow of those silent bulwarks the long lines of  the English bowmen, and the arrows whizzed in a deadly sleet among the  unprepared masses upon the pirate decks.
 From the higher sides of the  cog the bowmen could shoot straight down, at a range which was so short  as to enable a cloth-yard shaft to pierce through mail-coats or to  transfix a shield, though it were an inch thick of toughened wood.
  One moment Alleyne saw the galley's poop crowded with rushing figures,  waving arms, exultant faces; the next it was a blood-smeared shambles,  with bodies piled three deep upon each other, the living cowering behind  the dead to shelter themselves from that sudden storm-blast of death.
  On either side the seamen whom Sir Nigel had chosen for the purpose  had cast their anchors over the side of the galleys, so that the three  vessels, locked in an iron grip, lurched heavily forward upon the swell.
    And now set in a fell and fierce fight, one of a thousand of which no  chronicler has spoken and no poet sung.
 Through all the centuries and  over all those southern waters nameless men have fought in nameless  places, their sole monuments a protected coast and an unravaged  country-side.
    Fore and aft the archers had cleared the galleys' decks, but from either  side the rovers had poured down into the waist, where the seamen and  bowmen were pushed back and so mingled with their foes that it was  impossible for their comrades above to draw string to help them.
 It  was a wild chaos where axe and sword rose and fell, while Englishman,  Norman, and Italian staggered and reeled on a deck which was cumbered  with bodies and slippery with blood.
 The clang of blows, the cries of  the stricken, the short, deep shout of the islanders, and the fierce  whoops of the rovers, rose together in a deafening tumult, while the  breath of the panting men went up in the wintry air like the smoke from  a furnace.
 The giant Tete-noire, towering above his fellows and clad  from head to foot in plate of proof, led on his boarders, waving a  huge mace in the air, with which he struck to the deck every man who  approached him.
 On the other side, Spade-beard, a dwarf in height, but  of great breadth of shoulder and length of arm, had cut a road almost  to the mast, with three-score Genoese men-at-arms close at his heels.
  Between these two formidable assailants the seamen were being slowly  wedged more closely together, until they stood back to back under the  mast with the rovers raging upon every side of them.
    But help was close at hand.
 Sir Oliver Buttesthorn with his men-at-arms  had swarmed down from the forecastle, while Sir Nigel, with his three  squires, Black Simon, Aylward, Hordle John, and a score more, threw  themselves from the poop and hurled themselves into the thickest of the  fight.
 Alleyne, as in duty bound, kept his eyes fixed ever on his  lord and pressed forward close at his heels.
 Often had he heard of Sir  Nigel's prowess and skill with all knightly weapons, but all the tales  that had reached his ears fell far short of the real quickness and  coolness of the man.
 It was as if the devil was in him, for he sprang  here and sprang there, now thrusting and now cutting, catching blows on  his shield, turning them with his blade, stooping under the swing of an  axe, springing over the sweep of a sword, so swift and so erratic that  the man who braced himself for a blow at him might find him six paces  off ere he could bring it down.
 Three pirates had fallen before him, and  he had wounded Spade-beard in the neck, when the Norman giant sprang at  him from the side with a slashing blow from his deadly mace.
 Sir Nigel  stooped to avoid it, and at the same instant turned a thrust from the  Genoese swordsman, but, his foot slipping in a pool of blood, he fell  heavily to the ground.
 Alleyne sprang in front of the Norman, but his  sword was shattered and he himself beaten to the ground by a second  blow from the ponderous weapon.
 Ere the pirate chief could repeat it,  however, John's iron grip fell upon his wrist, and he found that for  once he was in the hands of a stronger man than himself.
    Fiercely he strove to disengage his weapon, but Hordle John bent his arm  slowly back until, with a sharp crack, like a breaking stave, it turned  limp in his grasp, and the mace dropped from the nerveless fingers.
 In  vain he tried to pluck it up with the other hand.
 Back and back still  his foeman bent him, until, with a roar of pain and of fury, the giant  clanged his full length upon the boards, while the glimmer of a knife  before the bars of his helmet warned him that short would be his shrift  if he moved.
    Cowed and disheartened by the loss of their leader, the Normans had  given back and were now streaming over the bulwarks on to their own  galley, dropping a dozen at a time on to her deck.
 But the anchor still  held them in its crooked claw, and Sir Oliver with fifty men was hard  upon their heels.
 Now, too, the archers had room to draw their bows  once more, and great stones from the yard of the cog came thundering and  crashing among the flying rovers.
 Here and there they rushed with wild  screams and curses, diving under the sail, crouching behind booms,  huddling into corners like rabbits when the ferrets are upon them,  as helpless and as hopeless.
 They were stern days, and if the honest  soldier, too poor for a ransom, had no prospect of mercy upon the  battle-field, what ruth was there for sea robbers, the enemies of  humankind, taken in the very deed, with proofs of their crimes still  swinging upon their yard-arm.
    But the fight had taken a new and a strange turn upon the other side.
  Spade-beard and his men had given slowly back, hard pressed by Sir  Nigel, Aylward, Black Simon, and the poop-guard.
 Foot by foot the  Italian had retreated, his armor running blood at every joint, his  shield split, his crest shorn, his voice fallen away to a mere gasping  and croaking.
 Yet he faced his foemen with dauntless courage, dashing  in, springing back, sure-footed, steady-handed, with a point which  seemed to menace three at once.
 Beaten back on to the deck of his  own vessel, and closely followed by a dozen Englishmen, he disengaged  himself from them, ran swiftly down the deck, sprang back into the  cog once more, cut the rope which held the anchor, and was back in an  instant among his crossbow-men.
 At the same time the Genoese sailors  thrust with their oars against the side of the cog, and a rapidly  widening rift appeared between the two vessels.
    "By St.
 George!" cried Ford, "we are cut off from Sir Nigel.
"    "He is lost," gasped Terlake.
 "Come, let us spring for it.
" The two  youths jumped with all their strength to reach the departing galley.
  Ford's feet reached the edge of the bulwarks, and his hand clutching a  rope he swung himself on board.
 Terlake fell short, crashed in among the  oars, and bounded off into the sea.
 Alleyne, staggering to the side, was  about to hurl himself after him, but Hordle John dragged him back by the  girdle.
    "You can scarce stand, lad, far less jump," said he.
 "See how the blood  rips from your bassinet.
"    "My place is by the flag," cried Alleyne, vainly struggling to break  from the other's hold.
    "Bide here, man.
 You would need wings ere you could reach Sir Nigel's  side.
"    The vessels were indeed so far apart now that the Genoese could use the  full sweep of their oars, and draw away rapidly from the cog.
    "My God, but it is a noble fight!" shouted big John, clapping his  hands.
 "They have cleared the poop, and they spring into the waist.
 Well  struck, my lord! Well struck, Aylward! See to Black Simon, how he storms  among the shipmen! But this Spade-beard is a gallant warrior.
 He rallies  his men upon the forecastle.
 He hath slain an archer.
 Ha! my lord is  upon him.
 Look to it, Alleyne! See to the whirl and glitter of it!"    "By heaven, Sir Nigel is down!" cried the squire.
    "Up!" roared John.
 "It was but a feint.
 He bears him back.
 He drives  him to the side.
 Ah, by Our Lady, his sword is through him! They cry for  mercy.
 Down goes the red cross, and up springs Simon with the scarlet  roses!"    The death of the Genoese leader did indeed bring the resistance to an  end.
 Amid a thunder of cheering from cog and from galleys the forked  pennon fluttered upon the forecastle, and the galley, sweeping round,  came slowly back, as the slaves who rowed it learned the wishes of their  new masters.
    The two knights had come aboard the cog, and the grapplings having been  thrown off, the three vessels now moved abreast.
 Through all the storm  and rush of the fight Alleyne had been aware of the voice of Goodwin  Hawtayne, the master-shipman, with his constant "Hale the bowline!  Veer the sheet!" and strange it was to him to see how swiftly the  blood-stained sailors turned from the strife to the ropes and back.
 Now  the cog's head was turned Francewards, and the shipman walked the deck,  a peaceful master-mariner once more.
    "There is sad scath done to the cog, Sir Nigel," said he.
 "Here is a  hole in the side two ells across, the sail split through the centre,  and the wood as bare as a friar's poll.
 In good sooth, I know not what I  shall say to Master Witherton when I see the Itchen once more.
"    "By St.
 Paul! it would be a very sorry thing if we suffered you to be  the worse of this day's work," said Sir Nigel.
 "You shall take these  galleys back with you, and Master Witherton may sell them.
 Then from the  moneys he shall take as much as may make good the damage, and the rest  he shall keep until our home-coming, when every man shall have his  share.
 An image of silver fifteen inches high I have vowed to the  Virgin, to be placed in her chapel within the Priory, for that she was  pleased to allow me to come upon this Spade-beard, who seemed to me from  what I have seen of him to be a very sprightly and valiant gentleman.
  But how fares it with you, Edricson?"    "It is nothing, my fair lord," said Alleyne, who had now loosened his  bassinet, which was cracked across by the Norman's blow.
 Even as he  spoke, however, his head swirled round, and he fell to the deck with the  blood gushing from his nose and mouth.
    "He will come to anon," said the knight, stooping over him and passing  his fingers through his hair.
 "I have lost one very valiant and gentle  squire this day.
 I can ill afford to lose another.
 How many men have  fallen?"    "I have pricked off the tally," said Aylward, who had come aboard with  his lord.
 "There are seven of the Winchester men, eleven seamen, your  squire, young Master Terlake, and nine archers.
"    "And of the others?"    "They are all dead--save only the Norman knight who stands behind you.
  What would you that we should do with him?"    "He must hang on his own yard," said Sir Nigel.
 "It was my vow and must  be done.
"    The pirate leader had stood by the bulwarks, a cord round his arms,  and two stout archers on either side.
 At Sir Nigel's words he started  violently, and his swarthy features blanched to a livid gray.
    "How, Sir Knight?" he cried in broken English.
 "Que dites vous? To hang,  le mort du chien! To hang!"    "It is my vow," said Sir Nigel shortly.
 "From what I hear, you thought  little enough of hanging others.
"    "Peasants, base roturiers," cried the other.
 "It is their fitting death.
  Mais Le Seigneur d'Andelys, avec le sang des rois dans ses veins! C'est  incroyable!"    Sir Nigel turned upon his heel, while two seamen cast a noose over the  pirate's neck.
 At the touch of the cord he snapped the bonds which bound  him, dashed one of the archers to the deck, and seizing the other round  the waist sprang with him into the sea.
    "By my hilt, he is gone!" cried Aylward, rushing to the side.
 "They have  sunk together like a stone.
"    "I am right glad of it," answered Sir Nigel; "for though it was against  my vow to loose him, I deem that he has carried himself like a very  gentle and debonnaire cavalier.
"        .
 HOW THE YELLOW COG CROSSED THE BAR OF GIRONDE.
      For two days the yellow cog ran swiftly before a northeasterly wind, and  on the dawn of the third the high land of Ushant lay like a mist upon  the shimmering sky-line.
 There came a plump of rain towards mid-day  and the breeze died down, but it freshened again before nightfall, and  Goodwin Hawtayne veered his sheet and held head for the south.
 Next  morning they had passed Belle Isle, and ran through the midst of a fleet  of transports returning from Guienne.
 Sir Nigel Loring and Sir Oliver  Buttesthorn at once hung their shields over the side, and displayed  their pennons as was the custom, noting with the keenest interest the  answering symbols which told the names of the cavaliers who had been  constrained by ill health or wounds to leave the prince at so critical a  time.
    That evening a great dun-colored cloud banked up in the west, and an  anxious man was Goodwin Hawtayne, for a third part of his crew had been  slain, and half the remainder were aboard the galleys, so that, with  an injured ship, he was little fit to meet such a storm as sweeps over  those waters.
 All night it blew in short fitful puffs, heeling the great  cog over until the water curled over her lee bulwarks.
 As the wind still  freshened the yard was lowered half way down the mast in the morning.
  Alleyne, wretchedly ill and weak, with his head still ringing from  the blow which he had received, crawled up upon deck.
 Water-swept and  aslant, it was preferable to the noisome, rat-haunted dungeons which  served as cabins.
 There, clinging to the stout halliards of the sheet,  he gazed with amazement at the long lines of black waves, each with  its curling ridge of foam, racing in endless succession from out the  inexhaustible west.
 A huge sombre cloud, flecked with livid blotches,  stretched over the whole seaward sky-line, with long ragged streamers  whirled out in front of it.
 Far behind them the two galleys labored  heavily, now sinking between the rollers until their yards were level  with the waves, and again shooting up with a reeling, scooping motion  until every spar and rope stood out hard against the sky.
 On the left  the low-lying land stretched in a dim haze, rising here and there into  a darker blur which marked the higher capes and headlands.
 The land  of France! Alleyne's eyes shone as he gazed upon it.
 The land of  France!--the very words sounded as the call of a bugle in the ears of  the youth of England.
 The land where their fathers had bled, the home of  chivalry and of knightly deeds, the country of gallant men, of courtly  women, of princely buildings, of the wise, the polished and the sainted.
  There it lay, so still and gray beneath the drifting wrack--the home of  things noble and of things shameful--the theatre where a new name  might be made or an old one marred.
 From his bosom to his lips came the  crumpled veil, and he breathed a vow that if valor and goodwill could  raise him to his lady's side, then death alone should hold him back from  her.
 His thoughts were still in the woods of Minstead and the old armory  of Twynham Castle, when the hoarse voice of the master-shipman brought  them back once more to the Bay of Biscay.
    "By my troth, young sir," he said, "you are as long in the face as the  devil at a christening, and I cannot marvel at it, for I have sailed  these waters since I was as high as this whinyard, and yet I never saw  more sure promise of an evil night.
"    "Nay, I had other things upon my mind," the squire answered.
    "And so has every man," cried Hawtayne in an injured voice.
 "Let the  shipman see to it.
 It is the master-shipman's affair.
 Put it all upon  good Master Hawtayne! Never had I so much care since first I blew  trumpet and showed cartel at the west gate of Southampton.
"    "What is amiss then?" asked Alleyne, for the man's words were as gusty  as the weather.
    "Amiss, quotha? Here am I with but half my mariners, and a hole in the  ship where that twenty-devil stone struck us big enough to fit the fat  widow of Northam through.
 It is well enough on this tack, but I would  have you tell me what I am to do on the other.
 We are like to have  salt water upon us until we be found pickled like the herrings in an  Easterling's barrels.
"    "What says Sir Nigel to it?"    "He is below pricking out the coat-armor of his mother's uncle.
 'Pester  me not with such small matters!' was all that I could get from him.
 Then  there is Sir Oliver.
 'Fry them in oil with a dressing of Gascony,' quoth  he, and then swore at me because I had not been the cook.
 'Walawa,'  thought I, 'mad master, sober man'--so away forward to the archers.
  Harrow and alas! but they were worse than the others.
"    "Would they not help you then?"    "Nay, they sat tway and tway at a board, him that they call Aylward  and the great red-headed man who snapped the Norman's arm-bone, and the  black man from Norwich, and a score of others, rattling their dice in  an archer's gauntlet for want of a box.
 'The ship can scarce last much  longer, my masters,' quoth I.
 'That is your business, old swine's-head,'  cried the black galliard.
 'Le diable t'emporte,' says Aylward.
 'A five,  a four and the main,' shouted the big man, with a voice like the flap of  a sail.
 Hark to them now, young sir, and say if I speak not sooth.
"    As he spoke, there sounded high above the shriek of the gale and the  straining of the timbers a gust of oaths with a roar of deep-chested  mirth from the gamblers in the forecastle.
    "Can I be of avail?" asked Alleyne.
 "Say the word and the thing is done,  if two hands may do it.
"    "Nay, nay, your head I can see is still totty, and i' faith little head  would you have, had your bassinet not stood your friend.
 All that may be  done is already carried out, for we have stuffed the gape with sails and  corded it without and within.
 Yet when we bale our bowline and veer the  sheet our lives will hang upon the breach remaining blocked.
 See how  yonder headland looms upon us through the mist! We must tack within  three arrow flights, or we may find a rock through our timbers.
 Now, St.
  Christopher be praised! here is Sir Nigel, with whom I may confer.
"    "I prythee that you will pardon me," said the knight, clutching his way  along the bulwark.
 "I would not show lack of courtesy toward a worthy  man, but I was deep in a matter of some weight, concerning which,  Alleyne, I should be glad of your rede.
 It touches the question of  dimidiation or impalement in the coat of mine uncle, Sir John Leighton  of Shropshire, who took unto wife the widow of Sir Henry Oglander  of Nunwell.
 The case has been much debated by pursuivants and  kings-of-arms.
 But how is it with you, master shipman?"    "Ill enough, my fair lord.
 The cog must go about anon, and I know not  how we may keep the water out of her.
"    "Go call Sir Oliver!" said Sir Nigel, and presently the portly knight  made his way all astraddle down the slippery deck.
    "By my soul, master-shipman, this passes all patience!" he cried  wrathfully.
 "If this ship of yours must needs dance and skip like a  clown at a kermesse, then I pray you that you will put me into one  of these galeasses.
 I had but sat down to a flask of malvoisie and a  mortress of brawn, as is my use about this hour, when there comes a  cherking, and I find my wine over my legs and the flask in my lap, and  then as I stoop to clip it there comes another cursed cherk, and there  is a mortress of brawn stuck fast to the nape of my neck.
 At this moment  I have two pages coursing after it from side to side, like hounds behind  a leveret.
 Never did living pig gambol more lightly.
 But you have sent  for me, Sir Nigel?"    "I would fain have your rede, Sir Oliver, for Master Hawtayne hath fears  that when we veer there may come danger from the hole in our side.
"    "Then do not veer," quoth Sir Oliver hastily.
 "And now, fair sir, I must  hasten back to see how my rogues have fared with the brawn.
"    "Nay, but this will scarce suffice," cried the shipman.
 "If we do not  veer we will be upon the rocks within the hour.
"    "Then veer," said Sir Oliver.
 "There is my rede; and now, Sir Nigel, I  must crave----"    At this instant, however, a startled shout rang out from two seamen upon  the forecastle.
 "Rocks!" they yelled, stabbing into the air with their  forefingers.
 "Rocks beneath our very bows!" Through the belly of a great  black wave, not one hundred paces to the front of them, there thrust  forth a huge jagged mass of brown stone, which spouted spray as though  it were some crouching monster, while a dull menacing boom and roar  filled the air.
    "Yare! yare!" screamed Goodwin Hawtayne, flinging himself upon the long  pole which served as a tiller.
 "Cut the halliard! Haul her over! Lay her  two courses to the wind!"    Over swung the great boom, and the cog trembled and quivered within five  spear-lengths of the breakers.
    "She can scarce draw clear," cried Hawtayne, with his eyes from the sail  to the seething line of foam.
 "May the holy Julian stand by us and the  thrice-sainted Christopher!"    "If there be such peril, Sir Oliver," quoth Sir Nigel, "it would be  very knightly and fitting that we should show our pennons.
 I pray you,  Edricson, that you will command my guidon-bearer to put forward my  banner.
"    "And sound the trumpets!" cried Sir Oliver.
 "In manus tuas, Domine! I  am in the keeping of James of Compostella, to whose shrine I shall make  pilgrimage, and in whose honor I vow that I will eat a carp each year  upon his feast-day.
 Mon Dieu, but the waves roar! How is it with us now,  master-shipman?"    "We draw! We draw!" cried Hawtayne, with his eyes still fixed upon the  foam which hissed under the very bulge of the side.
 "Ah, Holy Mother, be  with us now!"    As he spoke the cog rasped along the edge of the reef, and a long white  curling sheet of wood was planed off from her side from waist to poop by  a jutting horn of the rock.
 At the same instant she lay suddenly over,  the sail drew full, and she plunged seawards amid the shoutings of the  seamen and the archers.
    "The Virgin be praised!" cried the shipman, wiping his brow.
 "For this  shall bell swing and candle burn when I see Southampton Water once more.
  Cheerily, my hearts! Pull yarely on the bowline!"    "By my soul! I would rather have a dry death," quoth Sir Oliver.
  "Though, Mort Dieu! I have eaten so many fish that it were but justice  that the fish should eat me.
 Now I must back to the cabin, for I have  matters there which crave my attention.
"    "Nay, Sir Oliver, you had best bide with us, and still show your  ensign," Sir Nigel answered; "for, if I understand the matter aright, we  have but turned from one danger to the other.
"    "Good Master Hawtayne," cried the boatswain, rushing aft, "the water  comes in upon us apace.
 The waves have driven in the sail wherewith we  strove to stop the hole.
" As he spoke the seamen came swarming on to the  poop and the forecastle to avoid the torrent which poured through the  huge leak into the waist.
 High above the roar of the wind and the clash  of the sea rose the shrill half-human cries of the horses, as they found  the water rising rapidly around them.
    "Stop it from without!" cried Hawtayne, seizing the end of the wet sail  with which the gap had been plugged.
 "Speedily, my hearts, or we are  gone!" Swiftly they rove ropes to the corners, and then, rushing forward  to the bows, they lowered them under the keel, and drew them tight in  such a way that the sail should cover the outer face of the gap.
 The  force of the rush of water was checked by this obstacle, but it still  squirted plentifully from every side of it.
 At the sides the horses  were above the belly, and in the centre a man from the poop could scarce  touch the deck with a seven-foot spear.
 The cog lay lower in the water  and the waves splashed freely over the weather bulwark.
    "I fear that we can scarce bide upon this tack," cried Hawtayne; "and  yet the other will drive us on the rocks.
"    "Might we not haul down sail and wait for better times?" suggested Sir  Nigel.
    "Nay, we should drift upon the rocks.
 Thirty years have I been on the  sea, and never yet in greater straits.
 Yet we are in the hands of the  Saints.
"    "Of whom," cried Sir Oliver, "I look more particularly to St.
 James of  Compostella, who hath already befriended us this day, and on whose feast  I hereby vow that I shall eat a second carp, if he will but interpose a  second time.
"    The wrack had thickened to seaward, and the coast was but a blurred  line.
 Two vague shadows in the offing showed where the galeasses rolled  and tossed upon the great Atlantic rollers.
 Hawtayne looked wistfully in  their direction.
    "If they would but lie closer we might find safety, even should the cog  founder.
 You will bear me out with good Master Witherton of Southampton  that I have done all that a shipman might.
 It would be well that you  should doff camail and greaves, Sir Nigel, for, by the black rood! it is  like enough that we shall have to swim for it.
"    "Nay," said the little knight, "it would be scarce fitting that a  cavalier should throw off his harness for the fear of every puff of wind  and puddle of water.
 I would rather that my Company should gather round  me here on the poop, where we might abide together whatever God may be  pleased to send.
 But, certes, Master Hawtayne, for all that my sight  is none of the best, it is not the first time that I have seen that  headland upon the left.
"    The seaman shaded his eyes with his hand, and gazed earnestly through  the haze and spray.
 Suddenly he threw up his arms and shouted aloud in  his joy.
    "'Tis the point of La Tremblade!" he cried.
 "I had not thought that we  were as far as Oleron.
 The Gironde lies before us, and once over the  bar, and under shelter of the Tour de Cordouan, all will be well with  us.
 Veer again, my hearts, and bring her to try with the main course!"    The sail swung round once more, and the cog, battered and torn and  well-nigh water-logged, staggered in for this haven of refuge.
 A bluff  cape to the north and a long spit to the south marked the mouth of the  noble river, with a low-lying island of silted sand in the centre, all  shrouded and curtained by the spume of the breakers.
 A line of broken  water traced the dangerous bar, which in clear day and balmy weather has  cracked the back of many a tall ship.
    "There is a channel," said Hawtayne, "which was shown to me by the  Prince's own pilot.
 Mark yonder tree upon the bank, and see the tower  which rises behind it.
 If these two be held in a line, even as we hold  them now, it may be done, though our ship draws two good ells more than  when she put forth.
"    "God speed you, Master Hawtayne!" cried Sir Oliver.
 "Twice have we come  scathless out of peril, and now for the third time I commend me to the  blessed James of Compostella, to whom I vow----"    "Nay, nay, old friend," whispered Sir Nigel.
 "You are like to bring a  judgment upon us with these vows, which no living man could accomplish.
  Have I not already heard you vow to eat two carp in one day, and now you  would venture upon a third?"    "I pray you that you will order the Company to lie down," cried  Hawtayne, who had taken the tiller and was gazing ahead with a fixed  eye.
 "In three minutes we shall either be lost or in safety.
"    Archers and seamen lay flat upon the deck, waiting in stolid silence for  whatever fate might come.
 Hawtayne bent his weight upon the tiller, and  crouched to see under the bellying sail.
 Sir Oliver and Sir Nigel stood  erect with hands crossed in front of the poop.
 Down swooped the great  cog into the narrow channel which was the portal to safety.
 On either  bow roared the shallow bar.
 Right ahead one small lane of black swirling  water marked the pilot's course.
 But true was the eye and firm the hand  which guided.
 A dull scraping came from beneath, the vessel quivered  and shook, at the waist, at the quarter, and behind sounded that grim  roaring of the waters, and with a plunge the yellow cog was over the bar  and speeding swiftly up the broad and tranquil estuary of the Gironde.
        .
 HOW SIR NIGEL LORING PUT A PATCH UPON HIS EYE.
      It was on the morning of Friday, the eight-and-twentieth day of  November, two days before the feast of St.
 Andrew, that the cog and her  two prisoners, after a weary tacking up the Gironde and the Garonne,  dropped anchor at last in front of the noble city of Bordeaux.
 With  wonder and admiration, Alleyne, leaning over the bulwarks, gazed at the  forest of masts, the swarm of boats darting hither and thither on the  bosom of the broad curving stream, and the gray crescent-shaped city  which stretched with many a tower and minaret along the western shore.
  Never had he in his quiet life seen so great a town, nor was there in  the whole of England, save London alone, one which might match it in  size or in wealth.
 Here came the merchandise of all the fair countries  which are watered by the Garonne and the Dordogne--the cloths of the  south, the skins of Guienne, the wines of the Medoc--to be borne away to  Hull, Exeter, Dartmouth, Bristol or Chester, in exchange for the wools  and woolfels of England.
 Here too dwelt those famous smelters and  welders who had made the Bordeaux steel the most trusty upon earth, and  could give a temper to lance or to sword which might mean dear life to  its owner.
 Alleyne could see the smoke of their forges reeking up in the  clear morning air.
 The storm had died down now to a gentle breeze, which  wafted to his ears the long-drawn stirring bugle-calls which sounded  from the ancient ramparts.
    "Hola, mon petit!" said Aylward, coming up to where he stood.
 "Thou art  a squire now, and like enough to win the golden spurs, while I am still  the master-bowman, and master-bowman I shall bide.
 I dare scarce wag  my tongue so freely with you as when we tramped together past Wilverley  Chase, else I might be your guide now, for indeed I know every house in  Bordeaux as a friar knows the beads on his rosary.
"    "Nay, Aylward," said Alleyne, laying his hand upon the sleeve of his  companion's frayed jerkin, "you cannot think me so thrall as to throw  aside an old friend because I have had some small share of good fortune.
  I take it unkind that you should have thought such evil of me.
"    "Nay, mon gar.
 'Twas but a flight shot to see if the wind blew steady,  though I were a rogue to doubt it.
"    "Why, had I not met you, Aylward, at the Lynhurst inn, who can say where  I had now been! Certes, I had not gone to Twynham Castle, nor become  squire to Sir Nigel, nor met----" He paused abruptly and flushed to his  hair, but the bowman was too busy with his own thoughts to notice his  young companion's embarrassment.
    "It was a good hostel, that of the 'Pied Merlin,'" he remarked.
 "By my  ten finger bones! when I hang bow on nail and change my brigandine for a  tunic, I might do worse than take over the dame and her business.
"    "I thought," said Alleyne, "that you were betrothed to some one at  Christchurch.
"    "To three," Aylward answered moodily, "to three.
 I fear I may not go  back to Christchurch.
 I might chance to see hotter service in Hampshire  than I have ever done in Gascony.
 But mark you now yonder lofty turret  in the centre, which stands back from the river and hath a broad banner  upon the summit.
 See the rising sun flashes full upon it and sparkles  on the golden lions.
 'Tis the royal banner of England, crossed by the  prince's label.
 There he dwells in the Abbey of St.
 Andrew, where he  hath kept his court these years back.
 Beside it is the minster of the  same saint, who hath the town under his very special care.
"    "And how of yon gray turret on the left?"    "'Tis the fane of St.
 Michael, as that upon the right is of St.
 Remi.
  There, too, above the poop of yonder nief, you see the towers of Saint  Croix and of Pey Berland.
 Mark also the mighty ramparts which are  pierced by the three water-gates, and sixteen others to the landward  side.
"    "And how is it, good Aylward, that there comes so much music from the  town? I seem to hear a hundred trumpets, all calling in chorus.
"    "It would be strange else, seeing that all the great lords of England  and of Gascony are within the walls, and each would have his trumpeter  blow as loud as his neighbor, lest it might be thought that his dignity  had been abated.
 Ma foi! they make as much louster as a Scotch army,  where every man fills himself with girdle-cakes, and sits up all night  to blow upon the toodle-pipe.
 See all along the banks how the pages  water the horses, and there beyond the town how they gallop them over  the plain! For every horse you see a belted knight hath herbergage in  the town, for, as I learn, the men-at-arms and archers have already gone  forward to Dax.
"    "I trust, Aylward," said Sir Nigel, coming upon deck, "that the men are  ready for the land.
 Go tell them that the boats will be for them within  the hour.
"    The archer raised his hand in salute, and hastened forward.
 In the  meantime Sir Oliver had followed his brother knight, and the two paced  the poop together, Sir Nigel in his plum-colored velvet suit with flat  cap of the same, adorned in front with the Lady Loring's glove and girt  round with a curling ostrich feather.
 The lusty knight, on the other  hand, was clad in the very latest mode, with cote-hardie, doublet,  pourpoint, court-pie, and paltock of olive-green, picked out with  pink and jagged at the edges.
 A red chaperon or cap, with long hanging  cornette, sat daintily on the back of his black-curled head, while his  gold-hued shoes were twisted up _a la poulaine_, as though the toes  were shooting forth a tendril which might hope in time to entwine itself  around his massive leg.
    "Once more, Sir Oliver," said Sir Nigel, looking shorewards with  sparkling eyes, "do we find ourselves at the gate of honor, the door  which hath so often led us to all that is knightly and worthy.
 There  flies the prince's banner, and it would be well that we haste ashore and  pay our obeisance to him.
 The boats already swarm from the bank.
"    "There is a goodly hostel near the west gate, which is famed for the  stewing of spiced pullets," remarked Sir Oliver.
 "We might take the edge  of our hunger off ere we seek the prince, for though his tables are  gay with damask and silver he is no trencherman himself, and hath no  sympathy for those who are his betters.
"    "His betters!"    "His betters before the tranchoir, lad.
 Sniff not treason where none is  meant.
 I have seen him smile in his quiet way because I had looked for  the fourth time towards the carving squire.
 And indeed to watch  him dallying with a little gobbet of bread, or sipping his cup of  thrice-watered wine, is enough to make a man feel shame at his own  hunger.
 Yet war and glory, my good friend, though well enough in their  way, will not serve to tighten such a belt as clasps my waist.
"    "How read you that coat which hangs over yonder galley, Alleyne?" asked  Sir Nigel.
    "Argent, a bend vert between cotises dancette gules.
"    "It is a northern coat.
 I have seen it in the train of the Percies.
 From  the shields, there is not one of these vessels which hath not knight or  baron aboard.
 I would mine eyes were better.
 How read you this upon the  left?"    "Argent and azure, a barry wavy of six.
"    "Ha, it is the sign of the Wiltshire Stourtons! And there beyond I see  the red and silver of the Worsleys of Apuldercombe, who like myself are  of Hampshire lineage.
 Close behind us is the moline cross of the gallant  William Molyneux, and beside it the bloody chevrons of the Norfork  Woodhouses, with the amulets of the Musgraves of Westmoreland.
 By St.
  Paul! it would be a very strange thing if so noble a company were to  gather without some notable deed of arms arising from it.
 And here is  our boat, Sir Oliver, so it seems best to me that we should go to the  abbey with our squires, leaving Master Hawtayne to have his own way in  the unloading.
"    The horses both of knights and squires were speedily lowered into a  broad lighter, and reached the shore almost as soon as their masters.
  Sir Nigel bent his knee devoutly as he put foot on land, and taking a  small black patch from his bosom he bound it tightly over his left eye.
    "May the blessed George and the memory of my sweet lady-love raise high  my heart!" quoth he.
 "And as a token I vow that I will not take this  patch from my eye until I have seen something of this country of Spain,  and done such a small deed as it lies in me to do.
 And this I swear upon  the cross of my sword and upon the glove of my lady.
"    "In truth, you take me back twenty years, Nigel," quoth Sir Oliver, as  they mounted and rode slowly through the water-gate.
 "After Cadsand,  I deem that the French thought that we were an army of the blind, for  there was scarce a man who had not closed an eye for the greater love  and honor of his lady.
 Yet it goes hard with you that you should darken  one side, when with both open you can scarce tell a horse from a mule.
  In truth, friend, I think that you step over the line of reason in this  matter.
"    "Sir Oliver Buttesthorn," said the little knight shortly, "I would have  you to understand that, blind as I am, I can yet see the path of honor  very clearly, and that that is the road upon which I do not crave  another man's guidance.
"    "By my soul," said Sir Oliver, "you are as tart as verjuice this  morning! If you are bent upon a quarrel with me I must leave you to your  humor and drop into the 'Tete d'Or' here, for I marked a varlet pass  the door who bare a smoking dish, which had, methought, a most excellent  smell.
"    "Nenny, nenny," cried his comrade, laying his hand upon his knee; "we  have known each other over long to fall out, Oliver, like two raw pages  at their first epreuves.
 You must come with me first to the prince, and  then back to the hostel; though sure I am that it would grieve his heart  that any gentle cavalier should turn from his board to a common tavern.
  But is not that my Lord Delewar who waves to us? Ha! my fair lord, God  and Our Lady be with you! And there is Sir Robert Cheney.
 Good-morrow,  Robert! I am right glad to see you.
"    The two knights walked their horses abreast, while Alleyne and Ford,  with John Norbury, who was squire to Sir Oliver, kept some paces behind  them, a spear's-length in front of Black Simon and of the Winchester  guidon-bearer.
 Norbury, a lean, silent man, had been to those parts  before, and sat his horse with a rigid neck; but the two young squires  gazed eagerly to right or left, and plucked each other's sleeves to call  attention to the many strange things on every side of them.
    "See to the brave stalls!" cried Alleyne.
 "See to the noble armor set  forth, and the costly taffeta--and oh, Ford, see to where the scrivener  sits with the pigments and the ink-horns, and the rolls of sheepskin as  white as the Beaulieu napery! Saw man ever the like before?"    "Nay, man, there are finer stalls in Cheapside," answered Ford, whose  father had taken him to London on occasion of one of the Smithfield  joustings.
 "I have seen a silversmith's booth there which would serve to  buy either side of this street.
 But mark these houses, Alleyne, how they  thrust forth upon the top.
 And see to the coats-of-arms at every window,  and banner or pensil on the roof.
"    "And the churches!" cried Alleyne.
 "The Priory at Christchurch was a  noble pile, but it was cold and bare, methinks, by one of these, with  their frettings, and their carvings, and their traceries, as though some  great ivy-plant of stone had curled and wantoned over the walls.
"    "And hark to the speech of the folk!" said Ford.
 "Was ever such a  hissing and clacking? I wonder that they have not wit to learn English  now that they have come under the English crown.
 By Richard of Hampole!  there are fair faces amongst them.
 See the wench with the brown whimple!  Out on you, Alleyne, that you would rather gaze upon dead stone than on  living flesh!"    It was little wonder that the richness and ornament, not only of church  and of stall, but of every private house as well, should have impressed  itself upon the young squires.
 The town was now at the height of its  fortunes.
 Besides its trade and its armorers, other causes had combined  to pour wealth into it.
 War, which had wrought evil upon so many fair  cities around, had brought nought but good to this one.
 As her French  sisters decayed she increased, for here, from north, and from east,  and from south, came the plunder to be sold and the ransom money to be  spent.
 Through all her sixteen landward gates there had set for many  years a double tide of empty-handed soldiers hurrying Francewards, and  of enriched and laden bands who brought their spoils home.
 The prince's  court, too, with its swarm of noble barons and wealthy knights, many of  whom, in imitation of their master, had brought their ladies and their  children from England, all helped to swell the coffers of the burghers.
  Now, with this fresh influx of noblemen and cavaliers, food and lodging  were scarce to be had, and the prince was hurrying forward his forces to  Dax in Gascony to relieve the overcrowding of his capital.
    In front of the minster and abbey of St.
 Andrew's was a large square  crowded with priests, soldiers, women, friars, and burghers, who made it  their common centre for sight-seeing and gossip.
 Amid the knot of noisy  and gesticulating townsfolk, many small parties of mounted knights and  squires threaded their way towards the prince's quarters, where the  huge iron-clamped doors were thrown back to show that he held audience  within.
 Two-score archers stood about the gateway, and beat back from  time to time with their bow-staves the inquisitive and chattering crowd  who swarmed round the portal.
 Two knights in full armor, with lances  raised and closed visors, sat their horses on either side, while in the  centre, with two pages to tend upon him, there stood a noble-faced man  in flowing purple gown, who pricked off upon a sheet of parchment the  style and title of each applicant, marshalling them in their due order,  and giving to each the place and facility which his rank demanded.
 His  long white beard and searching eyes imparted to him an air of masterful  dignity, which was increased by his tabardlike vesture and the heraldic  barret cap with triple plume which bespoke his office.
    "It is Sir William de Pakington, the prince's own herald and scrivener,"  whispered Sir Nigel, as they pulled up amid the line of knights who  waited admission.
 "Ill fares it with the man who would venture to  deceive him.
 He hath by rote the name of every knight of France or of  England; and all the tree of his family, with his kinships, coat-armor,  marriages, augmentations, abatements, and I know not what beside.
 We  may leave our horses here with the varlets, and push forward with our  squires.
"    Following Sir Nigel's counsel, they pressed on upon foot until they were  close to the prince's secretary, who was in high debate with a young and  foppish knight, who was bent upon making his way past him.
    "Mackworth!" said the king-at-arms.
 "It is in my mind, young sir, that  you have not been presented before.
"    "Nay, it is but a day since I set foot in Bordeaux, but I feared lest  the prince should think it strange that I had not waited upon him.
"    "The prince hath other things to think upon," quoth Sir William de  Pakington; "but if you be a Mackworth you must be a Mackworth of  Normanton, and indeed I see now that your coat is sable and ermine.
"    "I am a Mackworth of Normanton," the other answered, with some  uneasiness of manner.
    "Then you must be Sir Stephen Mackworth, for I learn that when old  Sir Guy died he came in for the arms and the name, the war-cry and the  profit.
"    "Sir Stephen is my elder brother, and I am Arthur, the second son," said  the youth.
    "In sooth and in sooth!" cried the king-at-arms with scornful eyes.
 "And  pray, sir second son, where is the cadency mark which should mark your  rank.
 Dare you to wear your brother's coat without the crescent which  should stamp you as his cadet.
 Away to your lodgings, and come not  nigh the prince until the armorer hath placed the true charge upon your  shield.
" As the youth withdrew in confusion, Sir William's keen eye  singled out the five red roses from amid the overlapping shields and  cloud of pennons which faced him.
    "Ha!" he cried, "there are charges here which are above counterfeit.
  The roses of Loring and the boar's head of Buttesthorn may stand back  in peace, but by my faith! they are not to be held back in war.
 Welcome,  Sir Oliver, Sir Nigel! Chandos will be glad to his very heart-roots when  he sees you.
 This way, my fair sirs.
 Your squires are doubtless worthy  the fame of their masters.
 Down this passage, Sir Oliver! Edricson! Ha!  one of the old strain of Hampshire Edricsons, I doubt not.
 And Ford,  they are of a south Saxon stock, and of good repute.
 There are Norburys  in Cheshire and in Wiltshire, and also, as I have heard, upon the  borders.
 So, my fair sirs, and I shall see that you are shortly  admitted.
"    He had finished his professional commentary by flinging open a folding  door, and ushering the party into a broad hall, which was filled with  a great number of people who were waiting, like themselves, for an  audience.
 The room was very spacious, lighted on one side by three  arched and mullioned windows, while opposite was a huge fireplace in  which a pile of faggots was blazing merrily.
 Many of the company had  crowded round the flames, for the weather was bitterly cold; but the  two knights seated themselves upon a bancal, with their squires standing  behind them.
 Looking down the room, Alleyne marked that both floor and  ceiling were of the richest oak, the latter spanned by twelve arching  beams, which were adorned at either end by the lilies and the lions of  the royal arms.
 On the further side was a small door, on each side of  which stood men-at-arms.
 From time to time an elderly man in black with  rounded shoulders and a long white wand in his hand came softly forth  from this inner room, and beckoned to one or other of the company, who  doffed cap and followed him.
    The two knights were deep in talk, when Alleyne became aware of a  remarkable individual who was walking round the room in their direction.
  As he passed each knot of cavaliers every head turned to look after  him, and it was evident, from the bows and respectful salutations on  all sides, that the interest which he excited was not due merely to his  strange personal appearance.
 He was tall and straight as a lance, though  of a great age, for his hair, which curled from under his velvet cap of  maintenance, was as white as the new-fallen snow.
 Yet, from the swing of  his stride and the spring of his step, it was clear that he had not yet  lost the fire and activity of his youth.
 His fierce hawk-like face was  clean shaven like that of a priest, save for a long thin wisp of white  moustache which drooped down half way to his shoulder.
 That he had  been handsome might be easily judged from his high aquiline nose and  clear-cut chin; but his features had been so distorted by the seams and  scars of old wounds, and by the loss of one eye which had been torn  from the socket, that there was little left to remind one of the dashing  young knight who had been fifty years ago the fairest as well as the  boldest of the English chivalry.
 Yet what knight was there in that hall  of St.
 Andrew's who would not have gladly laid down youth, beauty, and  all that he possessed to win the fame of this man? For who could be  named with Chandos, the stainless knight, the wise councillor, the  valiant warrior, the hero of Crecy, of Winchelsea, of Poictiers, of  Auray, and of as many other battles as there were years to his life?    "Ha, my little heart of gold!" he cried, darting forward suddenly and  throwing his arms round Sir Nigel.
 "I heard that you were here and have  been seeking you.
"    "My fair and dear lord," said the knight, returning the warrior's  embrace, "I have indeed come back to you, for where else shall I go that  I may learn to be a gentle and a hardy knight?"    "By my troth!" said Chandos with a smile, "it is very fitting that we  should be companions, Nigel, for since you have tied up one of your  eyes, and I have had the mischance to lose one of mine, we have but a  pair between us.
 Ah, Sir Oliver! you were on the blind side of me and I  saw you not.
 A wise woman hath made prophecy that this blind side will  one day be the death of me.
 We shall go in to the prince anon; but in  truth he hath much upon his hands, for what with Pedro, and the King of  Majorca, and the King of Navarre, who is no two days of the same mind,  and the Gascon barons who are all chaffering for terms like so many  hucksters, he hath an uneasy part to play.
 But how left you the Lady  Loring?"    "She was well, my fair lord, and sent her service and greetings to you.
"    "I am ever her knight and slave.
 And your journey, I trust that it was  pleasant?"    "As heart could wish.
 We had sight of two rover galleys, and even came  to have some slight bickering with them.
"    "Ever in luck's way, Nigel!" quoth Sir John.
 "We must hear the tale  anon.
 But I deem it best that ye should leave your squires and come with  me, for, howsoe'er pressed the prince may be, I am very sure that he  would be loth to keep two old comrades-in-arms upon the further side of  the door.
 Follow close behind me, and I will forestall old Sir William,  though I can scarce promise to roll forth your style and rank as is  his wont.
" So saying, he led the way to the inner chamber, the two  companions treading close at his heels, and nodding to right and left as  they caught sight of familiar faces among the crowd.
        .
 HOW THERE WAS STIR AT THE ABBEY OF ST.
 ANDREW'S.
      The prince's reception-room, although of no great size, was fitted up  with all the state and luxury which the fame and power of its owner  demanded.
 A high dais at the further end was roofed in by a broad canopy  of scarlet velvet spangled with silver fleurs-de-lis, and supported at  either corner by silver rods.
 This was approached by four steps carpeted  with the same material, while all round were scattered rich cushions,  oriental mats and costly rugs of fur.
 The choicest tapestries which the  looms of Arras could furnish draped the walls, whereon the battles of  Judas Maccabaeus were set forth, with the Jewish warriors in plate of  proof, with crest and lance and banderole, as the naive artists of the  day were wont to depict them.
 A few rich settles and bancals, choicely  carved and decorated with glazed leather hangings of the sort termed _or  basane_, completed the furniture of the apartment, save that at one side  of the dais there stood a lofty perch, upon which a cast of three solemn  Prussian gerfalcons sat, hooded and jesseled, as silent and motionless  as the royal fowler who stood beside them.
    In the centre of the dais were two very high chairs with dorserets,  which arched forwards over the heads of the occupants, the whole covered  with light-blue silk thickly powdered with golden stars.
 On that to the  right sat a very tall and well formed man with red hair, a livid face,  and a cold blue eye, which had in it something peculiarly sinister and  menacing.
 He lounged back in a careless position, and yawned repeatedly  as though heartily weary of the proceedings, stooping from time to time  to fondle a shaggy Spanish greyhound which lay stretched at his feet.
 On  the other throne there was perched bolt upright, with prim demeanor, as  though he felt himself to be upon his good behavior, a little, round,  pippin faced person, who smiled and bobbed to every one whose eye he  chanced to meet.
 Between and a little in front of them on a humble  charette or stool, sat a slim, dark young man, whose quiet attire and  modest manner would scarce proclaim him to be the most noted prince in  Europe.
 A jupon of dark blue cloth, tagged with buckles and pendants of  gold, seemed but a sombre and plain attire amidst the wealth of silk and  ermine and gilt tissue of fustian with which he was surrounded.
 He sat  with his two hands clasped round his knee, his head slightly bent,  and an expression of impatience and of trouble upon his clear,  well-chiselled features.
 Behind the thrones there stood two men in  purple gowns, with ascetic, clean-shaven faces, and half a dozen other  high dignitaries and office-holders of Aquitaine.
 Below on either side  of the steps were forty or fifty barons, knights, and courtiers, ranged  in a triple row to the right and the left, with a clear passage in the  centre.
    "There sits the prince," whispered Sir John Chandos, as they entered.
  "He on the right is Pedro, whom we are about to put upon the Spanish  throne.
 The other is Don James, whom we purpose with the aid of God to  help to his throne in Majorca.
 Now follow me, and take it not to heart  if he be a little short in his speech, for indeed his mind is full of  many very weighty concerns.
"    The prince, however, had already observed their entrance, and, springing  to his feet, he had advanced with a winning smile and the light of  welcome in his eyes.
    "We do not need your good offices as herald here, Sir John," said he in  a low but clear voice; "these valiant knights are very well known to me.
  Welcome to Aquitaine, Sir Nigel Loring and Sir Oliver Buttesthorn.
 Nay,  keep your knee for my sweet father at Windsor.
 I would have your hands,  my friends.
 We are like to give you some work to do ere you see the  downs of Hampshire once more.
 Know you aught of Spain, Sir Oliver?"    "Nought, my sire, save that I have heard men say that there is a dish  named an olla which is prepared there, though I have never been clear in  my mind as to whether it was but a ragout such as is to be found in the  south, or whether there is some seasoning such as fennel or garlic which  is peculiar to Spain.
"    "Your doubts, Sir Oliver, shall soon be resolved," answered the prince,  laughing heartily, as did many of the barons who surrounded them.
 "His  majesty here will doubtless order that you have this dish hotly seasoned  when we are all safely in Castile.
"    "I will have a hotly seasoned dish for some folk I know of," answered  Don Pedro with a cold smile.
    "But my friend Sir Oliver can fight right hardily without either bite or  sup," remarked the prince.
 "Did I not see him at Poictiers, when for two  days we had not more than a crust of bread and a cup of foul water, yet  carrying himself most valiantly.
 With my own eyes I saw him in the rout  sweep the head from a knight of Picardy with one blow of his sword.
"    "The rogue got between me and the nearest French victual wain," muttered  Sir Oliver, amid a fresh titter from those who were near enough to catch  his words.
    "How many have you in your train?" asked the prince, assuming a graver  mien.
    "I have forty men-at-arms, sire," said Sir Oliver.
    "And I have one hundred archers and a score of lancers, but there are  two hundred men who wait for me on this side of the water upon the  borders of Navarre.
"    "And who are they, Sir Nigel?"    "They are a free company, sire, and they are called the White Company.
"    To the astonishment of the knight, his words provoked a burst of  merriment from the barons round, in which the two kings and the prince  were fain to join.
 Sir Nigel blinked mildly from one to the other, until  at last perceiving a stout black-bearded knight at his elbow, whose  laugh rang somewhat louder than the others, he touched him lightly upon  the sleeve.
    "Perchance, my fair sir," he whispered, "there is some small vow of  which I may relieve you.
 Might we not have some honorable debate upon  the matter.
 Your gentle courtesy may perhaps grant me an exchange of  thrusts.
"    "Nay, nay, Sir Nigel," cried the prince, "fasten not the offence upon  Sir Robert Briquet, for we are one and all bogged in the same mire.
  Truth to say, our ears have just been vexed by the doings of the same  company, and I have even now made vow to hang the man who held the rank  of captain over it.
 I little thought to find him among the bravest of my  own chosen chieftains.
 But the vow is now nought, for, as you have  never seen your company, it would be a fool's act to blame you for their  doings.
"    "My liege," said Sir Nigel, "it is a very small matter that I should be  hanged, albeit the manner of death is somewhat more ignoble than I had  hoped for.
 On the other hand, it would be a very grievous thing that  you, the Prince of England and the flower of knighthood, should make a  vow, whether in ignorance or no, and fail to bring it to fulfilment.
"    "Vex not your mind on that," the prince answered, smiling.
 "We have had  a citizen from Montauban here this very day, who told us such a tale of  sack and murder and pillage that it moved our blood; but our wrath was  turned upon the man who was in authority over them.
"    "My dear and honored master," cried Nigel, in great anxiety, "I fear me  much that in your gentleness of heart you are straining this vow which  you have taken.
 If there be so much as a shadow of a doubt as to the  form of it, it were a thousand times best----"    "Peace! peace!" cried the prince impatiently.
 "I am very well able to  look to my own vows and their performance.
 We hope to see you both  in the banquet-hall anon.
 Meanwhile you will attend upon us with our  train.
" He bowed, and Chandos, plucking Sir Oliver by the sleeve, led  them both away to the back of the press of courtiers.
    "Why, little coz," he whispered, "you are very eager to have your neck  in a noose.
 By my soul! had you asked as much from our new ally Don  Pedro, he had not baulked you.
 Between friends, there is overmuch of  the hangman in him, and too little of the prince.
 But indeed this  White Company is a rough band, and may take some handling ere you find  yourself safe in your captaincy.
"    "I doubt not, with the help of St.
 Paul, that I shall bring them to some  order," Sir Nigel answered.
 "But there are many faces here which are new  to me, though others have been before me since first I waited upon my  dear master, Sir Walter.
 I pray you to tell me, Sir John, who are these  priests upon the dais?"    "The one is the Archbishop of Bordeaux, Nigel, and the other the Bishop  of Agen.
"    "And the dark knight with gray-streaked beard? By my troth, he seems to  be a man of much wisdom and valor.
"    "He is Sir William Felton, who, with my unworthy self, is the chief  counsellor of the prince, he being high steward and I the seneschal of  Aquitaine.
"    "And the knights upon the right, beside Don Pedro?"    "They are cavaliers of Spain who have followed him in his exile.
 The one  at his elbow is Fernando de Castro, who is as brave and true a man as  heart could wish.
 In front to the right are the Gascon lords.
 You may  well tell them by their clouded brows, for there hath been some ill-will  of late betwixt the prince and them.
 The tall and burly man is the  Captal de Buch, whom I doubt not that you know, for a braver knight  never laid lance in rest.
 That heavy-faced cavalier who plucks his  skirts and whispers in his ear is Lord Oliver de Clisson, known also as  the butcher.
 He it is who stirs up strife, and forever blows the dying  embers into flame.
 The man with the mole upon his cheek is the Lord  Pommers, and his two brothers stand behind him, with the Lord Lesparre,  Lord de Rosem, Lord de Mucident, Sir Perducas d'Albret, the Souldich de  la Trane, and others.
 Further back are knights from Quercy, Limousin,  Saintonge, Poitou, and Aquitaine, with the valiant Sir Guiscard d'Angle.
  That is he in the rose-colored doublet with the ermine.
"    "And the knights upon this side?"    "They are all Englishmen, some of the household and others who like  yourself, are captains of companies.
 There is Lord Neville, Sir Stephen  Cossington, and Sir Matthew Gourney, with Sir Walter Huet, Sir Thomas  Banaster, and Sir Thomas Felton, who is the brother of the high steward.
  Mark well the man with the high nose and flaxen beard who hath placed  his hand upon the shoulder of the dark hard-faced cavalier in the  rust-stained jupon.
"    "Aye, by St.
 Paul!" observed Sir Nigel, "they both bear the print of  their armor upon their cotes-hardies.
 Methinks they are men who breathe  freer in a camp than a court.
"    "There are many of us who do that, Nigel," said Chandos, "and the head  of the court is, I dare warrant, among them.
 But of these two men the  one is Sir Hugh Calverley, and the other is Sir Robert Knolles.
"    Sir Nigel and Sir Oliver craned their necks to have the clearer view of  these famous warriors, the one a chosen leader of free companies, the  other a man who by his fierce valor and energy had raised himself from  the lowest ranks until he was second only to Chandos himself in the  esteem of the army.
    "He hath no light hand in war, hath Sir Robert," said Chandos.
 "If he  passes through a country you may tell it for some years to come.
 I have  heard that in the north it is still the use to call a house which hath  but the two gable ends left, without walls or roof, a Knolles' mitre.
"    "I have often heard of him," said Nigel, "and I have hoped to be so far  honored as to run a course with him.
 But hark, Sir John, what is amiss  with the prince?"    Whilst Chandos had been conversing with the two knights a continuous  stream of suitors had been ushered in, adventurers seeking to sell their  swords and merchants clamoring over some grievance, a ship detained  for the carriage of troops, or a tun of sweet wine which had the bottom  knocked out by a troop of thirsty archers.
 A few words from the prince  disposed of each case, and, if the applicant liked not the judgment, a  quick glance from the prince's dark eyes sent him to the door with the  grievance all gone out of him.
 The younger ruler had sat listlessly upon  his stool with the two puppet monarchs enthroned behind him, but of a  sudden a dark shadow passed over his face, and he sprang to his feet in  one of those gusts of passion which were the single blot upon his noble  and generous character.
    "How now, Don Martin de la Carra?" he cried.
 "How now, sirrah? What  message do you bring to us from our brother of Navarre?"    The new-comer to whom this abrupt query had been addressed was a tall  and exceedingly handsome cavalier who had just been ushered into the  apartment.
 His swarthy cheek and raven black hair spoke of the fiery  south, and he wore his long black cloak swathed across his chest and  over his shoulders in a graceful sweeping fashion, which was neither  English nor French.
 With stately steps and many profound bows, he  advanced to the foot of the dais before replying to the prince's  question.
    "My powerful and illustrious master," he began, "Charles, King of  Navarre, Earl of Evreux, Count of Champagne, who also writeth himself  Overlord of Bearn, hereby sends his love and greetings to his dear  cousin Edward, the Prince of Wales, Governor of Aquitaine, Grand  Commander of----"    "Tush! tush! Don Martin!" interrupted the prince, who had been beating  the ground with his foot impatiently during this stately preamble.
 "We  already know our cousin's titles and style, and, certes, we know our  own.
 To the point, man, and at once.
 Are the passes open to us, or does  your master go back from his word pledged to me at Libourne no later  than last Michaelmas?"    "It would ill become my gracious master, sire, to go back from  promise given.
 He does but ask some delay and certain conditions and  hostages----"    "Conditions! Hostages! Is he speaking to the Prince of England, or is it  to the bourgeois provost of some half-captured town! Conditions, quotha?  He may find much to mend in his own condition ere long.
 The passes are,  then, closed to us?"    "Nay, sire----"    "They are open, then?"    "Nay, sire, if you would but----"    "Enough, enough, Don Martin," cried the prince.
 "It is a sorry sight to  see so true a knight pleading in so false a cause.
 We know the doings of  our cousin Charles.
 We know that while with the right hand he takes our  fifty thousand crowns for the holding of the passes open, he hath his  left outstretched to Henry of Trastamare, or to the King of France, all  ready to take as many more for the keeping them closed.
 I know our good  Charles, and, by my blessed name-saint the Confessor, he shall learn  that I know him.
 He sets his kingdom up to the best bidder, like some  scullion farrier selling a glandered horse.
 He is----"    "My lord," cried Don Martin, "I cannot stand there to hear such words  of my master.
 Did they come from other lips, I should know better how to  answer them.
"    Don Pedro frowned and curled his lip, but the prince smiled and nodded  his approbation.
    "Your bearing and your words, Don Martin, are such I should have looked  for in you," he remarked.
 "You will tell the king, your master, that he  hath been paid his price and that if he holds to his promise he hath my  word for it that no scath shall come to his people, nor to their houses  or gear.
 If, however, we have not his leave, I shall come close at the  heels of this message without his leave, and bearing a key with me  which shall open all that he may close.
" He stooped and whispered to Sir  Robert Knolles and Sir Huge Calverley, who smiled as men well pleased,  and hastened from the room.
    "Our cousin Charles has had experience of our friendship," the prince  continued, "and now, by the Saints! he shall feel a touch of our  displeasure.
 I send now a message to our cousin Charles which his whole  kingdom may read.
 Let him take heed lest worse befall him.
 Where is my  Lord Chandos? Ha, Sir John, I commend this worthy knight to your care.
  You will see that he hath refection, and such a purse of gold as may  defray his charges, for indeed it is great honor to any court to have  within it so noble and gentle a cavalier.
 How say you, sire?" he  asked, turning to the Spanish refugee, while the herald of Navarre was  conducted from the chamber by the old warrior.
    "It is not our custom in Spain to reward pertness in a messenger," Don  Pedro answered, patting the head of his greyhound.
 "Yet we have all  heard the lengths to which your royal generosity runs.
"    "In sooth, yes," cried the King of Majorca.
    "Who should know it better than we?" said Don Pedro bitterly, "since we  have had to fly to you in our trouble as to the natural protector of all  who are weak.
"    "Nay, nay, as brothers to a brother," cried the prince, with sparkling  eyes.
 "We doubt not, with the help of God, to see you very soon restored  to those thrones from which you have been so traitorously thrust.
"    "When that happy day comes," said Pedro, "then Spain shall be to you as  Aquitaine, and, be your project what it may, you may ever count on every  troop and every ship over which flies the banner of Castile.
"    "And," added the other, "upon every aid which the wealth and power of  Majorca can bestow.
"    "Touching the hundred thousand crowns in which I stand your debtor,"  continued Pedro carelessly, "it can no doubt----"    "Not a word, sire, not a word!" cried the prince.
 "It is not now when  you are in grief that I would vex your mind with such base and sordid  matters.
 I have said once and forever that I am yours with every  bow-string of my army and every florin in my coffers.
"    "Ah! here is indeed a mirror of chivalry," said Don Pedro.
 "I think,  Sir Fernando, since the prince's bounty is stretched so far, that we  may make further use of his gracious goodness to the extent of fifty  thousand crowns.
 Good Sir William Felton, here, will doubtless settle  the matter with you.
"    The stout old English counsellor looked somewhat blank at this prompt  acceptance of his master's bounty.
    "If it please you, sire," he said, "the public funds are at their  lowest, seeing that I have paid twelve thousand men of the companies,  and the new taxes--the hearth-tax and the wine-tax--not yet come in.
 If  you could wait until the promised help from England comes----"    "Nay, nay, my sweet cousin," cried Don Pedro.
 "Had we known that your  own coffers were so low, or that this sorry sum could have weighed one  way or the other, we had been loth indeed----"    "Enough, sire, enough!" said the prince, flushing with vexation.
 "If  the public funds be, indeed, so backward, Sir William, there is still,  I trust, my own private credit, which hath never been drawn upon for my  own uses, but is now ready in the cause of a friend in adversity.
 Go,  raise this money upon our own jewels, if nought else may serve, and see  that it be paid over to Don Fernando.
"    "In security I offer----" cried Don Pedro.
    "Tush! tush!" said the prince.
 "I am not a Lombard, sire.
 Your kingly  pledge is my security, without bond or seal.
 But I have tidings for you,  my lords and lieges, that our brother of Lancaster is on his way for our  capital with four hundred lances and as many archers to aid us in our  venture.
 When he hath come, and when our fair consort is recovered in  her health, which I trust by the grace of God may be ere many weeks be  past, we shall then join the army at Dax, and set our banners to the  breeze once more.
"    A buzz of joy at the prospect of immediate action rose up from the group  of warriors.
 The prince smiled at the martial ardor which shone upon  every face around him.
    "It will hearten you to know," he continued, "that I have sure advices  that this Henry is a very valiant leader, and that he has it in his  power to make such a stand against us as promises to give us much honor  and pleasure.
 Of his own people he hath brought together, as I learn,  some fifty thousand, with twelve thousand of the French free companies,  who are, as you know very valiant and expert men-at-arms.
 It is certain  also, that the brave and worthy Bertrand de Guesclin hath ridden into  France to the Duke of Anjou, and purposes to take back with him great  levies from Picardy and Brittany.
 We hold Bertrand in high esteem, for  he has oft before been at great pains to furnish us with an honorable  encounter.
 What think you of it, my worthy Captal? He took you at  Cocherel, and, by my soul! you will have the chance now to pay that  score.
"    The Gascon warrior winced a little at the allusion, nor were his  countrymen around him better pleased, for on the only occasion when they  had encountered the arms of France without English aid they had met with  a heavy defeat.
    "There are some who say, sire," said the burly De Clisson, "that the  score is already overpaid, for that without Gascon help Bertrand had not  been taken at Auray, nor had King John been overborne at Poictiers.
"    "By heaven! but this is too much," cried an English nobleman.
 "Methinks  that Gascony is too small a cock to crow so lustily.
"    "The smaller cock, my Lord Audley, may have the longer spur," remarked  the Captal de Buch.
    "May have its comb clipped if it make over-much noise," broke in an  Englishman.
    "By our Lady of Rocamadour!" cried the Lord of Mucident, "this is more  than I can abide.
 Sir John Charnell, you shall answer to me for those  words!"    "Freely, my lord, and when you will," returned the Englishman  carelessly.
    "My Lord de Clisson," cried Lord Audley, "you look somewhat fixedly in  my direction.
 By God's soul! I should be right glad to go further into  the matter with you.
"    "And you, my Lord of Pommers," said Sir Nigel, pushing his way to the  front, "it is in my mind that we might break a lance in gentle and  honorable debate over the question.
"    For a moment a dozen challenges flashed backwards and forwards at this  sudden bursting of the cloud which had lowered so long between the  knights of the two nations.
 Furious and gesticulating the Gascons, white  and cold and sneering the English, while the prince with a half smile  glanced from one party to the other, like a man who loved to dwell upon  a fiery scene, and yet dreaded least the mischief go so far that he  might find it beyond his control.
    "Friends, friends!" he cried at last, "this quarrel must go no further.
  The man shall answer to me, be he Gascon or English, who carries it  beyond this room.
 I have overmuch need for your swords that you should  turn them upon each other.
 Sir John Charnell, Lord Audley, you do not  doubt the courage of our friends of Gascony?"    "Not I, sire," Lord Audley answered.
 "I have seen them fight too often  not to know that they are very hardy and valiant gentlemen.
"    "And so say I," quoth the other Englishman; "but, certes, there is no  fear of our forgetting it while they have a tongue in their heads.
"    "Nay, Sir John," said the prince reprovingly, "all peoples have their  own use and customs.
 There are some who might call us cold and dull and  silent.
 But you hear, my lords of Gascony, that these gentlemen had no  thought to throw a slur upon your honor or your valor, so let all anger  fade from your mind.
 Clisson, Captal, De Pommers, I have your word?"    "We are your subjects, sire," said the Gascon barons, though with no  very good grace.
 "Your words are our law.
"    "Then shall we bury all cause of unkindness in a flagon of Malvoisie,"  said the prince, cheerily.
 "Ho, there! the doors of the banquet-hall!  I have been over long from my sweet spouse but I shall be back with you  anon.
 Let the sewers serve and the minstrels play, while we drain a  cup to the brave days that are before us in the south!" He turned away,  accompanied by the two monarchs, while the rest of the company, with  many a compressed lip and menacing eye, filed slowly through the  side-door to the great chamber in which the royal tables were set forth.
        .
 HOW ALLEYNE WON HIS PLACE IN AN HONORABLE GUILD.
      Whilst the prince's council was sitting, Alleyne and Ford had remained  in the outer hall, where they were soon surrounded by a noisy group of  young Englishmen of their own rank, all eager to hear the latest news  from England.
    "How is it with the old man at Windsor?" asked one.
    "And how with the good Queen Philippa?"    "And how with Dame Alice Perrers?" cried a third.
    "The devil take your tongue, Wat!" shouted a tall young man, seizing  the last speaker by the collar and giving him an admonitory shake.
 "The  prince would take your head off for those words.
"    "By God's coif! Wat would miss it but little," said another.
 "It is as  empty as a beggar's wallet.
"    "As empty as an English squire, coz," cried the first speaker.
 "What a  devil has become of the maitre-des-tables and his sewers? They have not  put forth the trestles yet.
"    "Mon Dieu! if a man could eat himself into knighthood, Humphrey, you  had been a banneret at the least," observed another, amid a burst of  laughter.
    "And if you could drink yourself in, old leather-head, you had been  first baron of the realm," cried the aggrieved Humphrey.
 "But how of  England, my lads of Loring?"    "I take it," said Ford, "that it is much as it was when you were there  last, save that perchance there is a little less noise there.
"    "And why less noise, young Solomon?"    "Ah, that is for your wit to discover.
"    "Pardieu! here is a paladin come over, with the Hampshire mud still  sticking to his shoes.
 He means that the noise is less for our being out  of the country.
"    "They are very quick in these parts," said Ford, turning to Alleyne.
    "How are we to take this, sir?" asked the ruffling squire.
    "You may take it as it comes," said Ford carelessly.
    "Here is pertness!" cried the other.
    "Sir, I honor your truthfulness," said Ford.
    "Stint it, Humphrey," said the tall squire, with a burst of laughter.
  "You will have little credit from this gentleman, I perceive.
 Tongues  are sharp in Hampshire, sir.
"    "And swords?"    "Hum! we may prove that.
 In two days' time is the vepres du tournoi,  when we may see if your lance is as quick as your wit.
"    "All very well, Roger Harcomb," cried a burly, bull-necked young man,  whose square shoulders and massive limbs told of exceptional personal  strength.
 "You pass too lightly over the matter.
 We are not to be so  easily overcrowed.
 The Lord Loring hath given his proofs; but we know  nothing of his squires, save that one of them hath a railing tongue.
  And how of you, young sir?" bringing his heavy hand down on Alleyne's  shoulder.
    "And what of me, young sir?"    "Ma foi! this is my lady's page come over.
 Your cheek will be browner  and your hand harder ere you see your mother again.
"    "If my hand is not hard, it is ready.
"    "Ready? Ready for what? For the hem of my lady's train?"    "Ready to chastise insolence, sir," cried Alleyne with flashing eyes.
    "Sweet little coz!" answered the burly squire.
 "Such a dainty color!  Such a mellow voice! Eyes of a bashful maid, and hair like a three  years' babe! Voila!" He passed his thick fingers roughly through the  youth's crisp golden curls.
    "You seek to force a quarrel, sir," said the young man, white with  anger.
    "And what then?"    "Why, you do it like a country boor, and not like a gentle squire.
 Hast  been ill bred and as ill taught.
 I serve a master who could show you how  such things should be done.
"    "And how would he do it, O pink of squires?"    "He would neither be loud nor would he be unmannerly, but rather more  gentle than is his wont.
 He would say, 'Sir, I should take it as an  honor to do some small deed of arms against you, not for mine own glory  or advancement, but rather for the fame of my lady and for the upholding  of chivalry.
' Then he would draw his glove, thus, and throw it on the  ground; or, if he had cause to think that he had to deal with a churl,  he might throw it in his face--as I do now!"    A buzz of excitement went up from the knot of squires as Alleyne, his  gentle nature turned by this causeless attack into fiery resolution,  dashed his glove with all his strength into the sneering face of his  antagonist.
 From all parts of the hall squires and pages came running,  until a dense, swaying crowd surrounded the disputants.
    "Your life for this!" said the bully, with a face which was distorted  with rage.
    "If you can take it," returned Alleyne.
    "Good lad!" whispered Ford.
 "Stick to it close as wax.
"    "I shall see justice," cried Norbury, Sir Oliver's silent attendant.
    "You brought it upon yourself, John Tranter," said the tall squire,  who had been addressed as Roger Harcomb.
 "You must ever plague the  new-comers.
 But it were shame if this went further.
 The lad hath shown a  proper spirit.
"    "But a blow! a blow!" cried several of the older squires.
 "There must be  a finish to this.
"    "Nay; Tranter first laid hand upon his head," said Harcomb.
 "How say  you, Tranter? The matter may rest where it stands?"    "My name is known in these parts," said Tranter, proudly, "I can let  pass what might leave a stain upon another.
 Let him pick up his glove  and say that he has done amiss.
"    "I would see him in the claws of the devil first," whispered Ford.
    "You hear, young sir?" said the peacemaker.
 "Our friend will overlook  the matter if you do but say that you have acted in heat and haste.
"    "I cannot say that," answered Alleyne.
    "It is our custom, young sir, when new squires come amongst us from  England, to test them in some such way.
 Bethink you that if a man have  a destrier or a new lance he will ever try it in time of peace, lest in  days of need it may fail him.
 How much more then is it proper to test  those who are our comrades in arms.
"    "I would draw out if it may honorably be done," murmured Norbury  in Alleyne's ear.
 "The man is a noted swordsman and far above your  strength.
"    Edricson came, however, of that sturdy Saxon blood which is very slowly  heated, but once up not easily to be cooled.
 The hint of danger which  Norbury threw out was the one thing needed to harden his resolution.
    "I came here at the back of my master," he said, "and I looked on every  man here as an Englishman and a friend.
 This gentleman hath shown me a  rough welcome, and if I have answered him in the same spirit he has but  himself to thank.
 I will pick the glove up; but, certes, I shall abide  what I have done unless he first crave my pardon for what he hath said  and done.
"    Tranter shrugged his shoulders.
 "You have done what you could to save  him, Harcomb," said he.
 "We had best settle at once.
"    "So say I," cried Alleyne.
    "The council will not break up until the banquet," remarked a  gray-haired squire.
 "You have a clear two hours.
"    "And the place?"    "The tilting-yard is empty at this hour.
"    "Nay; it must not be within the grounds of the court, or it may go hard  with all concerned if it come to the ears of the prince.
"    "But there is a quiet spot near the river," said one youth.
 "We have  but to pass through the abbey grounds, along the armory wall, past the  church of St.
 Remi, and so down the Rue des Apotres.
"    "En avant, then!" cried Tranter shortly, and the whole assembly flocked  out into the open air, save only those whom the special orders of their  masters held to their posts.
 These unfortunates crowded to the small  casements, and craned their necks after the throng as far as they could  catch a glimpse of them.
    Close to the banks of the Garonne there lay a little tract of green  sward, with the high wall of a prior's garden upon one side and an  orchard with a thick bristle of leafless apple-trees upon the other.
 The  river ran deep and swift up to the steep bank; but there were few boats  upon it, and the ships were moored far out in the centre of the stream.
  Here the two combatants drew their swords and threw off their doublets,  for neither had any defensive armor.
 The duello with its stately  etiquette had not yet come into vogue, but rough and sudden encounters  were as common as they must ever be when hot-headed youth goes abroad  with a weapon strapped to its waist.
 In such combats, as well as in  the more formal sports of the tilting-yard, Tranter had won a name for  strength and dexterity which had caused Norbury to utter his well-meant  warning.
 On the other hand, Alleyne had used his weapons in constant  exercise and practice on every day for many months, and being by nature  quick of eye and prompt of hand, he might pass now as no mean swordsman.
  A strangely opposed pair they appeared as they approached each other:  Tranter dark and stout and stiff, with hairy chest and corded arms,  Alleyne a model of comeliness and grace, with his golden hair and his  skin as fair as a woman's.
 An unequal fight it seemed to most; but there  were a few, and they the most experienced, who saw something in the  youth's steady gray eye and wary step which left the issue open to  doubt.
    "Hold, sirs, hold!" cried Norbury, ere a blow had been struck.
 "This  gentleman hath a two-handed sword, a good foot longer than that of our  friend.
"    "Take mine, Alleyne," said Ford.
    "Nay, friends," he answered, "I understand the weight and balance of  mine own.
 To work, sir, for our lord may need us at the abbey!"    Tranter's great sword was indeed a mighty vantage in his favor.
 He stood  with his feet close together, his knees bent outwards, ready for a dash  inwards or a spring out.
 The weapon he held straight up in front of him  with blade erect, so that he might either bring it down with a swinging  blow, or by a turn of the heavy blade he might guard his own head and  body.
 A further protection lay in the broad and powerful guard which  crossed the hilt, and which was furnished with a deep and narrow notch,  in which an expert swordsman might catch his foeman's blade, and by  a quick turn of his wrist might snap it across.
 Alleyne, on the other  hand, must trust for his defence to his quick eye and active foot--for  his sword, though keen as a whetstone could make it, was of a light and  graceful build with a narrow, sloping pommel and a tapering steel.
    Tranter well knew his advantage and lost no time in putting it to use.
  As his opponent walked towards him he suddenly bounded forward and sent  in a whistling cut which would have severed the other in twain had he  not sprung lightly back from it.
 So close was it that the point ripped  a gash in the jutting edge of his linen cyclas.
 Quick as a panther,  Alleyne sprang in with a thrust, but Tranter, who was as active as he  was strong, had already recovered himself and turned it aside with a  movement of his heavy blade.
 Again he whizzed in a blow which made the  spectators hold their breath, and again Alleyne very quickly and swiftly  slipped from under it, and sent back two lightning thrusts which the  other could scarce parry.
 So close were they to each other that Alleyne  had no time to spring back from the next cut, which beat down his sword  and grazed his forehead, sending the blood streaming into his eyes and  down his cheeks.
 He sprang out beyond sword sweep, and the pair stood  breathing heavily, while the crowd of young squires buzzed their  applause.
    "Bravely struck on both sides!" cried Roger Harcomb.
 "You have both  won honor from this meeting, and it would be sin and shame to let it go  further.
"    "You have done enough, Edricson," said Norbury.
    "You have carried yourself well," cried several of the older squires.
    "For my part, I have no wish to slay this young man," said Tranter,  wiping his heated brow.
    "Does this gentleman crave my pardon for having used me despitefully?"  asked Alleyne.
    "Nay, not I.
"    "Then stand on your guard, sir!" With a clatter and dash the two blades  met once more, Alleyne pressing in so as to keep within the full sweep  of the heavy blade, while Tranter as continually sprang back to have  space for one of his fatal cuts.
 A three-parts-parried blow drew blood  from Alleyne's left shoulder, but at the same moment he wounded Tranter  slightly upon the thigh.
 Next instant, however, his blade had slipped  into the fatal notch, there was a sharp cracking sound with a tinkling  upon the ground, and he found a splintered piece of steel fifteen inches  long was all that remained to him of his weapon.
    "Your life is in my hands!" cried Tranter, with a bitter smile.
    "Nay, nay, he makes submission!" broke in several squires.
    "Another sword!" cried Ford.
    "Nay, sir," said Harcomb, "that is not the custom.
"    "Throw down your hilt, Edricson," cried Norbury.
    "Never!" said Alleyne.
 "Do you crave my pardon, sir?"    "You are mad to ask it.
"    "Then on guard again!" cried the young squire, and sprang in with a fire  and a fury which more than made up for the shortness of his weapon.
 It  had not escaped him that his opponent was breathing in short, hoarse  gasps, like a man who is dizzy with fatigue.
 Now was the time for the  purer living and the more agile limb to show their value.
 Back and back  gave Tranter, ever seeking time for a last cut.
 On and on came Alleyne,  his jagged point now at his foeman's face, now at his throat, now at  his chest, still stabbing and thrusting to pass the line of steel which  covered him.
 Yet his experienced foeman knew well that such efforts  could not be long sustained.
 Let him relax for one instant, and his  death-blow had come.
 Relax he must! Flesh and blood could not stand  the strain.
 Already the thrusts were less fierce, the foot less ready,  although there was no abatement of the spirit in the steady gray eyes.
  Tranter, cunning and wary from years of fighting, knew that his chance  had come.
 He brushed aside the frail weapon which was opposed to him,  whirled up his great blade, sprang back to get the fairer sweep--and  vanished into the waters of the Garonne.
    So intent had the squires, both combatants and spectators, been on  the matter in hand, that all thought of the steep bank and swift still  stream had gone from their minds.
 It was not until Tranter, giving back  before the other's fiery rush, was upon the very brink, that a general  cry warned him of his danger.
 That last spring, which he hoped would  have brought the fight to a bloody end, carried him clear of the edge,  and he found himself in an instant eight feet deep in the ice-cold  stream.
 Once and twice his gasping face and clutching fingers broke up  through the still green water, sweeping outwards in the swirl of the  current.
 In vain were sword-sheaths, apple-branches and belts linked  together thrown out to him by his companions.
 Alleyne had dropped his  shattered sword and was standing, trembling in every limb, with his rage  all changed in an instant to pity.
 For the third time the drowning man  came to the surface, his hands full of green slimy water-plants, his  eyes turned in despair to the shore.
 Their glance fell upon Alleyne,  and he could not withstand the mute appeal which he read in them.
 In an  instant he, too, was in the Garonne, striking out with powerful strokes  for his late foeman.
    Yet the current was swift and strong, and, good swimmer as he was, it  was no easy task which Alleyne had set himself.
 To clutch at Tranter and  to seize him by the hair was the work of a few seconds, but to hold his  head above water and to make their way out of the current was another  matter.
 For a hundred strokes he did not seem to gain an inch.
 Then at  last, amid a shout of joy and praise from the bank, they slowly drew  clear into more stagnant water, at the instant that a rope, made of a  dozen sword-belts linked together by the buckles, was thrown by  Ford into their very hands.
 Three pulls from eager arms, and the two  combatants, dripping and pale, were dragged up the bank, and lay panting  upon the grass.
    John Tranter was the first to come to himself, for although he had been  longer in the water, he had done nothing during that fierce battle with  the current.
 He staggered to his feet and looked down upon his rescuer,  who had raised himself upon his elbow, and was smiling faintly at the  buzz of congratulation and of praise which broke from the squires around  him.
    "I am much beholden to you, sir," said Tranter, though in no very  friendly voice.
 "Certes, I should have been in the river now but for  you, for I was born in Warwickshire, which is but a dry county, and  there are few who swim in those parts.
"    "I ask no thanks," Alleyne answered shortly.
 "Give me your hand to rise,  Ford.
"    "The river has been my enemy," said Tranter, "but it hath been a good  friend to you, for it has saved your life this day.
"    "That is as it may be," returned Alleyne.
    "But all is now well over," quoth Harcomb, "and no scath come of it,  which is more than I had at one time hoped for.
 Our young friend here  hath very fairly and honestly earned his right to be craftsman of  the Honorable Guild of the Squires of Bordeaux.
 Here is your doublet,  Tranter.
"    "Alas for my poor sword which lies at the bottom of the Garonne!" said  the squire.
    "Here is your pourpoint, Edricson," cried Norbury.
 "Throw it over your  shoulders, that you may have at least one dry garment.
"    "And now away back to the abbey!" said several.
    "One moment, sirs," cried Alleyne, who was leaning on Ford's shoulder,  with the broken sword, which he had picked up, still clutched in his  right hand.
 "My ears may be somewhat dulled by the water, and perchance  what has been said has escaped me, but I have not yet heard this  gentleman crave pardon for the insults which he put upon me in the  hall.
"    "What! do you still pursue the quarrel?" asked Tranter.
    "And why not, sir? I am slow to take up such things, but once afoot I  shall follow it while I have life or breath.
"    "Ma foi! you have not too much of either, for you are as white as  marble," said Harcomb bluntly.
 "Take my rede, sir, and let it drop, for  you have come very well out from it.
"    "Nay," said Alleyne, "this quarrel is none of my making; but, now that I  am here, I swear to you that I shall never leave this spot until I have  that which I have come for: so ask my pardon, sir, or choose another  glaive and to it again.
"    The young squire was deadly white from his exertions, both on the land  and in the water.
 Soaking and stained, with a smear of blood on his  white shoulder and another on his brow, there was still in his whole  pose and set of face the trace of an inflexible resolution.
 His  opponent's duller and more material mind quailed before the fire and  intensity of a higher spiritual nature.
    "I had not thought that you had taken it so amiss," said he awkwardly.
  "It was but such a jest as we play upon each other, and, if you must  have it so, I am sorry for it.
"    "Then I am sorry too," quoth Alleyne warmly, "and here is my hand upon  it.
"    "And the none-meat horn has blown three times," quoth Harcomb, as they  all streamed in chattering groups from the ground.
 "I know not what the  prince's maitre-de-cuisine will say or think.
 By my troth! master Ford,  your friend here is in need of a cup of wine, for he hath drunk deeply  of Garonne water.
 I had not thought from his fair face that he had stood  to this matter so shrewdly.
"    "Faith," said Ford, "this air of Bordeaux hath turned our turtle-dove  into a game-cock.
 A milder or more courteous youth never came out of  Hampshire.
"    "His master also, as I understand, is a very mild and courteous  gentleman," remarked Harcomb; "yet I do not think that they are either  of them men with whom it is very safe to trifle.
"        .
 HOW AGOSTINO PISANO RISKED HIS HEAD.
      Even the squires' table at the Abbey of St.
 Andrew's at Bordeaux was  on a very sumptuous scale while the prince held his court there.
 Here  first, after the meagre fare of Beaulieu and the stinted board of the  Lady Loring, Alleyne learned the lengths to which luxury and refinement  might be pushed.
 Roasted peacocks, with the feathers all carefully  replaced, so that the bird lay upon the dish even as it had strutted in  life, boars' heads with the tusks gilded and the mouth lined with silver  foil, jellies in the shape of the Twelve Apostles, and a great pasty  which formed an exact model of the king's new castle at Windsor--these  were a few of the strange dishes which faced him.
 An archer had brought  him a change of clothes from the cog, and he had already, with the  elasticity of youth, shaken off the troubles and fatigues of the  morning.
 A page from the inner banqueting-hall had come with word that  their master intended to drink wine at the lodgings of the Lord Chandos  that night, and that he desired his squires to sleep at the hotel of the  "Half Moon" on the Rue des Apotres.
 Thither then they both set out in  the twilight after the long course of juggling tricks and glee-singing  with which the principal meal was concluded.
    A thin rain was falling as the two youths, with their cloaks over their  heads, made their way on foot through the streets of the old town,  leaving their horses in the royal stables.
 An occasional oil lamp at the  corner of a street, or in the portico of some wealthy burgher, threw a  faint glimmer over the shining cobblestones, and the varied motley crowd  who, in spite of the weather, ebbed and flowed along every highway.
 In  those scattered circles of dim radiance might be seen the whole  busy panorama of life in a wealthy and martial city.
 Here passed the  round-faced burgher, swollen with prosperity, his sweeping dark-clothed  gaberdine, flat velvet cap, broad leather belt and dangling pouch all  speaking of comfort and of wealth.
 Behind him his serving wench, her  blue whimple over her head, and one hand thrust forth to bear the  lanthorn which threw a golden bar of light along her master's path.
  Behind them a group of swaggering, half-drunken Yorkshire dalesmen,  speaking a dialect which their own southland countrymen could scarce  comprehend, their jerkins marked with the pelican, which showed that  they had come over in the train of the north-country Stapletons.
 The  burgher glanced back at their fierce faces and quickened his step, while  the girl pulled her whimple closer round her, for there was a meaning in  their wild eyes, as they stared at the purse and the maiden, which  men of all tongues could understand.
 Then came archers of the guard,  shrill-voiced women of the camp, English pages with their fair skins and  blue wondering eyes, dark-robed friars, lounging men-at-arms, swarthy  loud-tongued Gascon serving-men, seamen from the river, rude peasants  of the Medoc, and becloaked and befeathered squires of the court, all  jostling and pushing in an ever-changing, many-colored stream, while  English, French, Welsh, Basque, and the varied dialects of Gascony and  Guienne filled the air with their babel.
 From time to time the throng  would be burst asunder and a lady's horse-litter would trot past towards  the abbey, or there would come a knot of torch-bearing archers walking  in front of Gascon baron or English knight, as he sought his lodgings after  the palace revels.
 Clatter of hoofs, clinking of weapons, shouts from the  drunken brawlers, and high laughter of women, they all rose up, like  the mist from a marsh, out of the crowded streets of the dim-lit city.
    One couple out of the moving throng especially engaged the attention  of the two young squires, the more so as they were going in their own  direction and immediately in front of them.
 They consisted of a man and  a girl, the former very tall with rounded shoulders, a limp of one  foot, and a large flat object covered with dark cloth under his arm.
  His companion was young and straight, with a quick, elastic step and  graceful bearing, though so swathed in a black mantle that little could  be seen of her face save a flash of dark eyes and a curve of raven hair.
  The tall man leaned heavily upon her to take the weight off his tender  foot, while he held his burden betwixt himself and the wall, cuddling it  jealously to his side, and thrusting forward his young companion to act  as a buttress whenever the pressure of the crowd threatened to bear him  away.
 The evident anxiety of the man, the appearance of his attendant,  and the joint care with which they defended their concealed possession,  excited the interest of the two young Englishmen who walked within  hand-touch of them.
    "Courage, child!" they heard the tall man exclaim in strange hybrid  French.
 "If we can win another sixty paces we are safe.
"    "Hold it safe, father," the other answered, in the same soft, mincing  dialect.
 "We have no cause for fear.
"    "Verily, they are heathens and barbarians," cried the man; "mad,  howling, drunken barbarians! Forty more paces, Tita mia, and I swear to  the holy Eloi, patron of all learned craftsmen, that I will never set  foot over my door again until the whole swarm are safely hived in their  camp of Dax, or wherever else they curse with their presence.
 Twenty  more paces, my treasure! Ah, my God! how they push and brawl! Get  in their way, Tita mia! Put your little elbow bravely out! Set your  shoulders squarely against them, girl! Why should you give way to these  mad islanders? Ah, cospetto! we are ruined and destroyed!"    The crowd had thickened in front, so that the lame man and the girl had  come to a stand.
 Several half-drunken English archers, attracted, as  the squires had been, by their singular appearance, were facing towards  them, and peering at them through the dim light.
    "By the three kings!" cried one, "here is an old dotard shrew to have  so goodly a crutch! Use the leg that God hath given you, man, and do not  bear so heavily upon the wench.
"    "Twenty devils fly away with him!" shouted another.
 "What, how, man!  are brave archers to go maidless while an old man uses one as a  walking-staff?"    "Come with me, my honey-bird!" cried a third, plucking at the girl's  mantle.
    "Nay, with me, my heart's desire!" said the first.
 "By St.
 George! our  life is short, and we should be merry while we may.
 May I never see  Chester Bridge again, if she is not a right winsome lass!"    "What hath the old toad under his arm?" cried one of the others.
 "He  hugs it to him as the devil hugged the pardoner.
"    "Let us see, old bag of bones; let us see what it is that you have  under your arm!" They crowded in upon him, while he, ignorant of their  language, could but clutch the girl with one hand and the parcel with  the other, looking wildly about in search of help.
    "Nay, lads, nay!" cried Ford, pushing back the nearest archer.
 "This  is but scurvy conduct.
 Keep your hands off, or it will be the worse for  you.
"    "Keep your tongue still, or it will be the worse for you," shouted the  most drunken of the archers.
 "Who are you to spoil sport?"    "A raw squire, new landed," said another.
 "By St.
 Thomas of Kent! we are  at the beck of our master, but we are not to be ordered by every babe  whose mother hath sent him as far as Aquitaine.
"    "Oh, gentlemen," cried the girl in broken French, "for dear Christ's  sake stand by us, and do not let these terrible men do us an injury.
"    "Have no fears, lady," Alleyne answered.
 "We shall see that all is  well with you.
 Take your hand from the girl's wrist, you north-country  rogue!"    "Hold to her, Wat!" said a great black-bearded man-at-arms, whose steel  breast-plate glimmered in the dusk.
 "Keep your hands from your bodkins,  you two, for that was my trade before you were born, and, by God's soul!  I will drive a handful of steel through you if you move a finger.
"    "Thank God!" said Alleyne suddenly, as he spied in the lamp-light a  shock of blazing red hair which fringed a steel cap high above the heads  of the crowd.
 "Here is John, and Aylward, too! Help us, comrades, for  there is wrong being done to this maid and to the old man.
"    "Hola, mon petit," said the old bowman, pushing his way through the  crowd, with the huge forester at his heels.
 "What is all this, then?  By the twang of string! I think that you will have some work upon your  hands if you are to right all the wrongs that you may see upon this side  of the water.
 It is not to be thought that a troop of bowmen, with the  wine buzzing in their ears, will be as soft-spoken as so many young  clerks in an orchard.
 When you have been a year with the Company  you will think less of such matters.
 But what is amiss here? The  provost-marshal with his archers is coming this way, and some of you may  find yourselves in the stretch-neck, if you take not heed.
"    "Why, it is old Sam Aylward of the White Company!" shouted the  man-at-arms.
 "Why, Samkin, what hath come upon thee? I can call to mind  the day when you were as roaring a blade as ever called himself a free  companion.
 By my soul! from Limoges to Navarre, who was there who would  kiss a wench or cut a throat as readily as bowman Aylward of Hawkwood's  company?"    "Like enough, Peter," said Aylward, "and, by my hilt! I may not have  changed so much.
 But it was ever a fair loose and a clear mark with me.
  The wench must be willing, or the man must be standing up against me,  else, by these ten finger bones! either were safe enough for me.
"    A glance at Aylward's resolute face, and at the huge shoulders of Hordle  John, had convinced the archers that there was little to be got by  violence.
 The girl and the old man began to shuffle on in the crowd  without their tormentors venturing to stop them.
 Ford and Alleyne  followed slowly behind them, but Aylward caught the latter by the  shoulder.
    "By my hilt! camarade," said he, "I hear that you have done great things  at the Abbey to-day, but I pray you to have a care, for it was I who  brought you into the Company, and it would be a black day for me if  aught were to befall you.
"    "Nay, Aylward, I will have a care.
"    "Thrust not forward into danger too much, mon petit.
 In a little time  your wrist will be stronger and your cut more shrewd.
 There will be some  of us at the 'Rose de Guienne' to-night, which is two doors from the  hotel of the 'Half Moon,' so if you would drain a cup with a few simple  archers you will be right welcome.
"    Alleyne promised to be there if his duties would allow, and then,  slipping through the crowd, he rejoined Ford, who was standing in talk  with the two strangers, who had now reached their own doorstep.
    "Brave young signor," cried the tall man, throwing his arms round  Alleyne, "how can we thank you enough for taking our parts against those  horrible drunken barbarians.
 What should we have done without you? My  Tita would have been dragged away, and my head would have been shivered  into a thousand fragments.
"    "Nay, I scarce think that they would have mishandled you so," said  Alleyne in surprise.
    "Ho, ho!" cried he with a high crowing laugh, "it is not the head upon  my shoulders that I think of.
 Cospetto! no.
 It is the head under my arm  which you have preserved.
"    "Perhaps the signori would deign to come under our roof, father," said  the maiden.
 "If we bide here, who knows that some fresh tumult may not  break out.
"    "Well said, Tita! Well said, my girl! I pray you, sirs, to honor my  unworthy roof so far.
 A light, Giacomo! There are five steps up.
 Now  two more.
 So! Here we are at last in safety.
 Corpo di Bacco! I would  not have given ten maravedi for my head when those children of the devil  were pushing us against the wall.
 Tita mia, you have been a brave girl,  and it was better that you should be pulled and pushed than that my head  should be broken.
"    "Yes indeed, father," said she earnestly.
    "But those English! Ach! Take a Goth, a Hun, and a Vandal, mix them  together and add a Barbary rover; then take this creature and make him  drunk--and you have an Englishman.
 My God! were ever such people upon  earth! What place is free from them? I hear that they swarm in Italy  even as they swarm here.
 Everywhere you will find them, except in  heaven.
"    "Dear father," cried Tita, still supporting the angry old man, as he  limped up the curved oaken stair.
 "You must not forget that these good  signori who have preserved us are also English.
"    "Ah, yes.
 My pardon, sirs! Come into my rooms here.
 There are some who  might find some pleasure in these paintings, but I learn the art of war  is the only art which is held in honor in your island.
"    The low-roofed, oak-panelled room into which he conducted them was  brilliantly lit by four scented oil lamps.
 Against the walls, upon the  table, on the floor, and in every part of the chamber were great sheets  of glass painted in the most brilliant colors.
 Ford and Edricson gazed  around them in amazement, for never had they seen such magnificent works  of art.
    "You like them then," the lame artist cried, in answer to the look of  pleasure and of surprise in their faces.
 "There are then some of you who  have a taste for such trifling.
"    "I could not have believed it," exclaimed Alleyne.
 "What color! What  outlines! See to this martyrdom of the holy Stephen, Ford.
 Could you not  yourself pick up one of these stones which lie to the hand of the wicked  murtherers?"    "And see this stag, Alleyne, with the cross betwixt its horns.
 By my  faith! I have never seen a better one at the Forest of Bere.
"    "And the green of this grass--how bright and clear! Why all the painting  that I have seen is but child's play beside this.
 This worthy gentleman  must be one of those great painters of whom I have oft heard brother  Bartholomew speak in the old days at Beaulieu.
"    The dark mobile face of the artist shone with pleasure at the unaffected  delight of the two young Englishmen.
 His daughter had thrown off her  mantle and disclosed a face of the finest and most delicate Italian  beauty, which soon drew Ford's eyes from the pictures in front of him.
  Alleyne, however, continued with little cries of admiration and of  wonderment to turn from the walls to the table and yet again to the  walls.
    "What think you of this, young sir?" asked the painter, tearing off the  cloth which concealed the flat object which he had borne beneath his  arm.
 It was a leaf-shaped sheet of glass bearing upon it a face with a  halo round it, so delicately outlined, and of so perfect a tint, that it  might have been indeed a human face which gazed with sad and thoughtful  eyes upon the young squire.
 He clapped his hands, with that thrill of  joy which true art will ever give to a true artist.
    "It is great!" he cried.
 "It is wonderful! But I marvel, sir, that you  should have risked a work of such beauty and value by bearing it at  night through so unruly a crowd.
"    "I have indeed been rash," said the artist.
 "Some wine, Tita, from the  Florence flask! Had it not been for you, I tremble to think of what  might have come of it.
 See to the skin tint: it is not to be replaced,  for paint as you will, it is not once in a hundred times that it is not  either burned too brown in the furnace or else the color will not hold,  and you get but a sickly white.
 There you can see the very veins and the  throb of the blood.
 Yes, diavolo! if it had broken, my heart would have  broken too.
 It is for the choir window in the church of St.
 Remi, and  we had gone, my little helper and I, to see if it was indeed of the size  for the stonework.
 Night had fallen ere we finished, and what could we  do save carry it home as best we might? But you, young sir, you speak as  if you too knew something of the art.
"    "So little that I scarce dare speak of it in your presence," Alleyne  answered.
 "I have been cloister-bred, and it was no very great matter to  handle the brush better than my brother novices.
"    "There are pigments, brush, and paper," said the old artist.
 "I do not  give you glass, for that is another matter, and takes much skill in the  mixing of colors.
 Now I pray you to show me a touch of your art.
 I thank  you, Tita! The Venetian glasses, cara mia, and fill them to the brim.
 A  seat, signor!"    While Ford, in his English-French, was conversing with Tita in her  Italian-French, the old man was carefully examining his precious head to  see that no scratch had been left upon its surface.
 When he glanced up  again, Alleyne had, with a few bold strokes of the brush, tinted in a  woman's face and neck upon the white sheet in front of him.
    "Diavolo!" exclaimed the old artist, standing with his head on one side,  "you have power; yes, cospetto! you have power, it is the face of an  angel!"    "It is the face of the Lady Maude Loring!" cried Ford, even more  astonished.
    "Why, on my faith, it is not unlike her!" said Alleyne, in some  confusion.
    "Ah! a portrait! So much the better.
 Young man, I am Agostino Pisano,  the son of Andrea Pisano, and I say again that you have power.
 Further,  I say, that, if you will stay with me, I will teach you all the secrets  of the glass-stainers' mystery: the pigments and their thickening,  which will fuse into the glass and which will not, the furnace and the  glazing--every trick and method you shall know.
"    "I would be right glad to study under such a master," said Alleyne; "but  I am sworn to follow my lord whilst this war lasts.
"    "War! war!" cried the old Italian.
 "Ever this talk of war.
 And the men  that you hold to be great--what are they? Have I not heard their names?  Soldiers, butchers, destroyers! Ah, per Bacco! we have men in Italy who  are in very truth great.
 You pull down, you despoil; but they build up,  they restore.
 Ah, if you could but see my own dear Pisa, the Duomo, the  cloisters of Campo Santo, the high Campanile, with the mellow throb of  her bells upon the warm Italian air! Those are the works of great men.
  And I have seen them with my own eyes, these very eyes which look upon  you.
 I have seen Andrea Orcagna, Taddeo Gaddi, Giottino, Stefano, Simone  Memmi--men whose very colors I am not worthy to mix.
 And I have seen the  aged Giotto, and he in turn was pupil to Cimabue, before whom there was  no art in Italy, for the Greeks were brought to paint the chapel of the  Gondi at Florence.
 Ah, signori, there are the real great men whose names  will be held in honor when your soldiers are shown to have been the  enemies of humankind.
"    "Faith, sir," said Ford, "there is something to say for the soldiers  also, for, unless they be defended, how are all these gentlemen whom you  have mentioned to preserve the pictures which they have painted?"    "And all these!" said Alleyne.
 "Have you indeed done them all?--and  where are they to go?"    "Yes, signor, they are all from my hand.
 Some are, as you see, upon one  sheet, and some are in many pieces which may fasten together.
 There are  some who do but paint upon the glass, and then, by placing another sheet  of glass upon the top and fastening it, they keep the air from their  painting.
 Yet I hold that the true art of my craft lies as much in the  furnace as in the brush.
 See this rose window, which is from the model  of the Church of the Holy Trinity at Vendome, and this other of the  'Finding of the Grail,' which is for the apse of the Abbey church.
 Time  was when none but my countrymen could do these things; but there is  Clement of Chartres and others in France who are very worthy workmen.
  But, ah! there is that ever shrieking brazen tongue which will not let  us forget for one short hour that it is the arm of the savage, and not  the hand of the master, which rules over the world.
"    A stern, clear bugle call had sounded close at hand to summon some  following together for the night.
    "It is a sign to us as well," said Ford.
 "I would fain stay here forever  amid all these beautiful things--" staring hard at the blushing Tita as  he spoke--"but we must be back at our lord's hostel ere he reach it.
"  Amid renewed thanks and with promises to come again, the two squires  bade their leave of the old Italian glass-stainer and his daughter.
 The  streets were clearer now, and the rain had stopped, so they made their  way quickly from the Rue du Roi, in which their new friends dwelt, to  the Rue des Apotres, where the hostel of the "Half Moon" was situated.
        .
 HOW THE BOWMEN HELD WASSAIL AT THE "ROSE DE GUIENNE.
"      "Mon Dieu! Alleyne, saw you ever so lovely a face?" cried Ford as they  hurried along together.
 "So pure, so peaceful, and so beautiful!"    "In sooth, yes.
 And the hue of the skin the most perfect that ever I  saw.
 Marked you also how the hair curled round the brow? It was wonder  fine.
"    "Those eyes, too!" cried Ford.
 "How clear and how tender--simple, and  yet so full of thought!"    "If there was a weakness it was in the chin," said Alleyne.
    "Nay.
 I saw none.
"    "It was well curved, it is true.
"    "Most daintily so.
"    "And yet----"    "What then, Alleyne? Wouldst find flaw in the sun?"    "Well, bethink you, Ford, would not more power and expression have been  put into the face by a long and noble beard?"    "Holy Virgin!" cried Ford, "the man is mad.
 A beard on the face of  little Tita!"    "Tita! Who spoke of Tita?"    "Who spoke of aught else?"    "It was the picture of St.
 Remi, man, of which I have been discoursing.
"    "You are indeed," cried Ford, laughing, "a Goth, Hun, and Vandal, with  all the other hard names which the old man called us.
 How could you  think so much of a smear of pigments, when there was such a picture  painted by the good God himself in the very room with you? But who is  this?"    "If it please you, sirs," said an archer, running across to them,  "Aylward and others would be right glad to see you.
 They are within  here.
 He bade me say to you that the Lord Loring will not need your  service to-night, as he sleeps with the Lord Chandos.
"    "By my faith!" said Ford, "we do not need a guide to lead us to their  presence.
" As he spoke there came a roar of singing from the tavern upon  the right, with shouts of laughter and stamping of feet.
 Passing under  a low door, and down a stone-flagged passage, they found themselves in a  long narrow hall lit up by a pair of blazing torches, one at either end.
  Trusses of straw had been thrown down along the walls, and reclining on  them were some twenty or thirty archers, all of the Company, their  steel caps and jacks thrown off, their tunics open and their great limbs  sprawling upon the clay floor.
 At every man's elbow stood his leathern  blackjack of beer, while at the further end a hogshead with its end  knocked in promised an abundant supply for the future.
 Behind the  hogshead, on a half circle of kegs, boxes, and rude settles, sat  Aylward, John, Black Simon and three or four other leading men of the  archers, together with Goodwin Hawtayne, the master-shipman, who had  left his yellow cog in the river to have a last rouse with his friends  of the Company.
 Ford and Alleyne took their seats between Aylward and  Black Simon, without their entrance checking in any degree the hubbub  which was going on.
    "Ale, mes camarades?" cried the bowman, "or shall it be wine? Nay,  but ye must have the one or the other.
 Here, Jacques, thou limb of the  devil, bring a bottrine of the oldest vernage, and see that you do not  shake it.
 Hast heard the news?"    "Nay," cried both the squires.
    "That we are to have a brave tourney.
"    "A tourney?"    "Aye, lads.
 For the Captal du Buch hath sworn that he will find  five knights from this side of the water who will ride over any five  Englishmen who ever threw leg over saddle; and Chandos hath taken up the  challenge, and the prince hath promised a golden vase for the man who  carries himself best, and all the court is in a buzz over it.
"    "Why should the knights have all the sport?" growled Hordle John.
 "Could  they not set up five archers for the honor of Aquitaine and of Gascony?"    "Or five men-at-arms," said Black Simon.
    "But who are the English knights?" asked Hawtayne.
    "There are three hundred and forty-one in the town," said Aylward, "and  I hear that three hundred and forty cartels and defiances have already  been sent in, the only one missing being Sir John Ravensholme, who is in  his bed with the sweating sickness, and cannot set foot to ground.
"    "I have heard of it from one of the archers of the guard," cried a  bowman from among the straw; "I hear that the prince wished to break a  lance, but that Chandos would not hear of it, for the game is likely to  be a rough one.
"    "Then there is Chandos.
"    "Nay, the prince would not permit it.
 He is to be marshal of the lists,  with Sir William Felton and the Duc d'Armagnac.
 The English will be the  Lord Audley, Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Thomas Wake, Sir William Beauchamp,  and our own very good lord and leader.
"    "Hurrah for him, and God be with him!" cried several.
 "It is honor to  draw string in his service.
"    "So you may well say," said Aylward.
 "By my ten finger-bones! if you  march behind the pennon of the five roses you are like to see all that a  good bowman would wish to see.
 Ha! yes, mes garcons, you laugh, but, by  my hilt! you may not laugh when you find yourselves where he will take  you, for you can never tell what strange vow he may not have sworn to.
 I  see that he has a patch over his eye, even as he had at Poictiers.
 There  will come bloodshed of that patch, or I am the more mistaken.
"    "How chanced it at Poictiers, good Master Aylward?" asked one of the  young archers, leaning upon his elbows, with his eyes fixed respectfully  upon the old bowman's rugged face.
    "Aye, Aylward, tell us of it," cried Hordle John.
    "Here is to old Samkin Aylward!" shouted several at the further end of  the room, waving their blackjacks in the air.
    "Ask him!" said Aylward modestly, nodding towards Black Simon.
 "He saw  more than I did.
 And yet, by the holy nails! there was not very much  that I did not see either.
"    "Ah, yes," said Simon, shaking his head, "it was a great day.
 I never  hope to see such another.
 There were some fine archers who drew their  last shaft that day.
 We shall never see better men, Aylward.
"    "By my hilt! no.
 There was little Robby Withstaff, and Andrew  Salblaster, and Wat Alspaye, who broke the neck of the German.
 Mon Dieu!  what men they were! Take them how you would, at long butts or short,  hoyles, rounds, or rovers, better bowmen never twirled a shaft over  their thumb-nails.
"    "But the fight, Aylward, the fight!" cried several impatiently.
    "Let me fill my jack first, boys, for it is a thirsty tale.
 It was at  the first fall of the leaf that the prince set forth, and he passed  through Auvergne, and Berry, and Anjou, and Touraine.
 In Auvergne the  maids are kind, but the wines are sour.
 In Berry it is the women that  are sour, but the wines are rich.
 Anjou, however, is a very good  land for bowmen, for wine and women are all that heart could wish.
 In  Touraine I got nothing save a broken pate, but at Vierzon I had a great  good fortune, for I had a golden pyx from the minster, for which I  afterwards got nine Genoan janes from the goldsmith in the Rue  Mont Olive.
 From thence we went to Bourges, where I had a tunic of  flame-colored silk and a very fine pair of shoes with tassels of silk  and drops of silver.
"    "From a stall, Aylward?" asked one of the young archers.
    "Nay, from a man's feet, lad.
 I had reason to think that he might not  need them again, seeing that a thirty-inch shaft had feathered in his  back.
"    "And what then, Aylward?"    "On we went, coz, some six thousand of us, until we came to Issodun, and  there again a very great thing befell.
"    "A battle, Aylward?"    "Nay, nay; a greater thing than that.
 There is little to be gained out  of a battle, unless one have the fortune to win a ransom.
 At Issodun I  and three Welshmen came upon a house which all others had passed, and  we had the profit of it to ourselves.
 For myself, I had a fine  feather-bed--a thing which you will not see in a long day's journey in  England.
 You have seen it, Alleyne, and you, John.
 You will bear me out  that it is a noble bed.
 We put it on a sutler's mule, and bore it after  the army.
 It was on my mind that I would lay it by until I came to  start house of mine own, and I have it now in a very safe place near  Lyndhurst.
"    "And what then, master-bowman?" asked Hawtayne.
 "By St.
 Christopher! it  is indeed a fair and goodly life which you have chosen, for you gather  up the spoil as a Warsash man gathers lobsters, without grace or favor  from any man.
"    "You are right, master-shipman," said another of the older archers.
  "It is an old bowyer's rede that the second feather of a fenny goose is  better than the pinion of a tame one.
 Draw on old lad, for I have come  between you and the clout.
"    "On we went then," said Aylward, after a long pull at his blackjack.
  "There were some six thousand of us, with the prince and his knights,  and the feather-bed upon a sutler's mule in the centre.
 We made great  havoc in Touraine, until we came into Romorantin, where I chanced upon  a gold chain and two bracelets of jasper, which were stolen from me the  same day by a black-eyed wench from the Ardennes.
 Mon Dieu! there are  some folk who have no fear of Domesday in them, and no sign of grace in  their souls, for ever clutching and clawing at another man's chattels.
"    "But the battle, Aylward, the battle!" cried several, amid a burst of  laughter.
    "I come to it, my young war-pups.
 Well, then, the King of France had  followed us with fifty thousand men, and he made great haste to catch  us, but when he had us he scarce knew what to do with us, for we were  so drawn up among hedges and vineyards that they could not come nigh us,  save by one lane.
 On both sides were archers, men-at-arms and knights  behind, and in the centre the baggage, with my feather-bed upon a  sutler's mule.
 Three hundred chosen knights came straight for it, and,  indeed, they were very brave men, but such a drift of arrows met them  that few came back.
 Then came the Germans, and they also fought very  bravely, so that one or two broke through the archers and came as far  as the feather-bed, but all to no purpose.
 Then out rides our own little  hothead with the patch over his eye, and my Lord Audley with his four  Cheshire squires, and a few others of like kidney, and after them went  the prince and Chandos, and then the whole throng of us, with axe and  sword, for we had shot away our arrows.
 Ma foi! it was a foolish thing,  for we came forth from the hedges, and there was naught to guard the  baggage had they ridden round behind us.
 But all went well with us, and  the king was taken, and little Robby Withstaff and I fell in with a wain  with twelve firkins of wine for the king's own table, and, by my hilt!  if you ask me what happened after that, I cannot answer you, nor can  little Robby Withstaff either.
"    "And next day?"    "By my faith! we did not tarry long, but we hied back to Bordeaux, where  we came in safety with the King of France and also the feather-bed.
 I  sold my spoil, mes garcons, for as many gold-pieces as I could hold in  my hufken, and for seven days I lit twelve wax candles upon the altar of  St.
 Andrew; for if you forget the blessed when things are well with you,  they are very likely to forget you when you have need of them.
 I have a  score of one hundred and nineteen pounds of wax against the holy Andrew,  and, as he was a very just man, I doubt not that I shall have full weigh  and measure when I have most need of it.
"    "Tell me, master Aylward," cried a young fresh-faced archer at the  further end of the room, "what was this great battle about?"    "Why, you jack-fool, what would it be about save who should wear the  crown of France?"    "I thought that mayhap it might be as to who should have this  feather-bed of thine.
"    "If I come down to you, Silas, I may lay my belt across your shoulders,"  Aylward answered, amid a general shout of laughter.
 "But it is time  young chickens went to roost when they dare cackle against their elders.
  It is late, Simon.
"    "Nay, let us have another song.
"    "Here is Arnold of Sowley will troll as good a stave as any man in the  Company.
"    "Nay, we have one here who is second to none," said Hawtayne, laying his  hand upon big John's shoulder.
 "I have heard him on the cog with a voice  like the wave upon the shore.
 I pray you, friend, to give us 'The Bells  of Milton,' or, if you will, 'The Franklin's Maid.
'"    Hordle John drew the back of his hand across his mouth, fixed his eyes  upon the corner of the ceiling, and bellowed forth, in a voice which  made the torches flicker, the southland ballad for which he had been  asked:--            The franklin he hath gone to roam,          The franklin's maid she bides at home,          But she is cold and coy and staid,          And who may win the franklin's maid?            There came a knight of high renown          In bassinet and ciclatoun;          On bended knee full long he prayed,          He might not win the franklin's maid.
            There came a squire so debonair          His dress was rich, his words were fair,          He sweetly sang, he deftly played:          He could not win the franklin's maid.
            There came a mercer wonder-fine          With velvet cap and gaberdine;          For all his ships, for all his trade          He could not buy the franklin's maid.
            There came an archer bold and true,          With bracer guard and stave of yew;          His purse was light, his jerkin frayed;          Haro, alas! the franklin's maid!            Oh, some have laughed and some have cried          And some have scoured the country-side!          But off they ride through wood and glade,          The bowman and the franklin's maid.
    A roar of delight from his audience, with stamping of feet and beating  of blackjacks against the ground, showed how thoroughly the song was  to their taste, while John modestly retired into a quart pot, which he  drained in four giant gulps.
 "I sang that ditty in Hordle ale-house ere  I ever thought to be an archer myself," quoth he.
    "Fill up your stoups!" cried Black Simon, thrusting his own goblet into  the open hogshead in front of him.
 "Here is a last cup to the White  Company, and every brave boy who walks behind the roses of Loring!"    "To the wood, the flax, and the gander's wing!" said an old gray-headed  archer on the right.
    "To a gentle loose, and the King of Spain for a mark at fourteen score!"  cried another.
    "To a bloody war!" shouted a fourth.
 "Many to go and few to come!"    "With the most gold to the best steel!" added a fifth.
    "And a last cup to the maids of our heart!" cried Aylward.
 "A steady  hand and a true eye, boys; so let two quarts be a bowman's portion.
"  With shout and jest and snatch of song they streamed from the room, and  all was peaceful once more in the "Rose de Guienne.
"        .
 HOW ENGLAND HELD THE LISTS AT BORDEAUX.
 So used were the  good burghers of Bordeaux to martial display and knightly sport, that an  ordinary joust or tournament was an everyday matter with them.
 The fame  and brilliancy of the prince's court had drawn the knights-errant and  pursuivants-of-arms from every part of Europe.
 In the long lists by the  Garonne on the landward side of the northern gate there had been many a  strange combat, when the Teutonic knight, fresh from the conquest of the  Prussian heathen, ran a course against the knight of Calatrava, hardened  by continual struggle against the Moors, or cavaliers from Portugal  broke a lance with Scandinavian warriors from the further shore of the  great Northern Ocean.
 Here fluttered many an outland pennon, bearing  symbol and blazonry from the banks of the Danube, the wilds of Lithuania  and the mountain strongholds of Hungary; for chivalry was of no clime  and of no race, nor was any land so wild that the fame and name of the  prince had not sounded through it from border to border.
    Great, however, was the excitement through town and district when it  was learned that on the third Wednesday in Advent there would be held  a passage-at-arms in which five knights of England would hold the lists  against all comers.
 The great concourse of noblemen and famous soldiers,  the national character of the contest, and the fact that this was a last  trial of arms before what promised to be an arduous and bloody war,  all united to make the event one of the most notable and brilliant that  Bordeaux had ever seen.
 On the eve of the contest the peasants flocked  in from the whole district of the Medoc, and the fields beyond the walls  were whitened with the tents of those who could find no warmer lodging.
  From the distant camp of Dax, too, and from Blaye, Bourge, Libourne, St.
  Emilion, Castillon, St.
 Macaire, Cardillac, Ryons, and all the cluster  of flourishing towns which look upon Bordeaux as their mother, there  thronged an unceasing stream of horsemen and of footmen, all converging  upon the great city.
 By the morning of the day on which the courses were  to be run, not less than eighty people had assembled round the lists  and along the low grassy ridge which looks down upon the scene of the  encounter.
    It was, as may well be imagined, no easy matter among so many noted  cavaliers to choose out five on either side who should have precedence  over their fellows.
 A score of secondary combats had nearly arisen from  the rivalries and bad blood created by the selection, and it was only  the influence of the prince and the efforts of the older barons which  kept the peace among so many eager and fiery soldiers.
 Not till the day  before the courses were the shields finally hung out for the inspection  of the ladies and the heralds, so that all men might know the names  of the champions and have the opportunity to prefer any charge against  them, should there be stain upon them which should disqualify them from  taking part in so noble and honorable a ceremony.
    Sir Hugh Calverley and Sir Robert Knolles had not yet returned from  their raid into the marches of the Navarre, so that the English party  were deprived of two of their most famous lances.
 Yet there remained so  many good names that Chandos and Felton, to whom the selection had been  referred, had many an earnest consultation, in which every feat of  arms and failure or success of each candidate was weighed and balanced  against the rival claims of his companions.
 Lord Audley of Cheshire,  the hero of Poictiers, and Loring of Hampshire, who was held to be the  second lance in the army, were easily fixed upon.
 Then, of the younger  men, Sir Thomas Percy of Northumberland, Sir Thomas Wake of Yorkshire,  and Sir William Beauchamp of Gloucestershire, were finally selected to  uphold the honor of England.
 On the other side were the veteran Captal  de Buch and the brawny Olivier de Clisson, with the free companion  Sir Perducas d'Albret, the valiant Lord of Mucident, and Sigismond von  Altenstadt, of the Teutonic Order.
 The older soldiers among the English  shook their heads as they looked upon the escutcheons of these famous  warriors, for they were all men who had spent their lives upon the  saddle, and bravery and strength can avail little against experience and  wisdom of war.
    "By my faith! Sir John," said the prince as he rode through the winding  streets on his way to the list, "I should have been glad to have  splintered a lance to-day.
 You have seen me hold a spear since I had  strength to lift one, and should know best whether I do not merit a  place among this honorable company.
"    "There is no better seat and no truer lance, sire," said Chandos; "but,  if I may say so without fear of offence, it were not fitting that you  should join in this debate.
"    "And why, Sir John?"    "Because, sire, it is not for you to take part with Gascons against  English, or with English against Gascons, seeing that you are lord of  both.
 We are not too well loved by the Gascons now, and it is but the  golden link of your princely coronet which holds us together.
 If that be  snapped I know not what would follow.
"    "Snapped, Sir John!" cried the prince, with an angry sparkle in his dark  eyes.
 "What manner of talk is this? You speak as though the allegiance  of our people were a thing which might be thrown off or on like a  falcon's jessel.
"    "With a sorry hack one uses whip and spur, sire," said Chandos; "but  with a horse of blood and spirit a good cavalier is gentle and soothing,  coaxing rather than forcing.
 These folk are strange people, and you must  hold their love, even as you have it now, for you will get from their  kindness what all the pennons in your army could not wring from them.
"    "You are over-grave to-day, John," the prince answered.
 "We may keep  such questions for our council-chamber.
 But how now, my brothers of  Spain, and of Majorca, what think you of this challenge?"    "I look to see some handsome joisting," said Don Pedro, who rode with  the King of Majorca upon the right of the prince, while Chandos was on  the left.
 "By St.
 James of Compostella! but these burghers would bear  some taxing.
 See to the broadcloth and velvet that the rogues bear upon  their backs! By my troth! if they were my subjects they would be glad  enough to wear falding and leather ere I had done with them.
 But mayhap  it is best to let the wool grow long ere you clip it.
"    "It is our pride," the prince answered coldly, "that we rule over  freemen and not slaves.
"    "Every man to his own humor," said Pedro carelessly.
 "Carajo! there is a  sweet face at yonder window! Don Fernando, I pray you to mark the house,  and to have the maid brought to us at the abbey.
"    "Nay, brother, nay!" cried the prince impatiently.
 "I have had occasion  to tell you more than once that things are not ordered in this way in  Aquitaine.
"    "A thousand pardons, dear friend," the Spaniard answered quickly, for a  flush of anger had sprung to the dark cheek of the English prince.
 "You  make my exile so like a home that I forget at times that I am not in  very truth back in Castile.
 Every land hath indeed its ways and manners;  but I promise you, Edward, that when you are my guest in Toledo or  Madrid you shall not yearn in vain for any commoner's daughter on whom  you may deign to cast your eye.
"    "Your talk, sire," said the prince still more coldly, "is not such as  I love to hear from your lips.
 I have no taste for such amours as you  speak of, and I have sworn that my name shall be coupled with that of no  woman save my ever dear wife.
"    "Ever the mirror of true chivalry!" exclaimed Pedro, while James of  Majorca, frightened at the stern countenance of their all-powerful  protector, plucked hard at the mantle of his brother exile.
    "Have a care, cousin," he whispered; "for the sake of the Virgin have a  care, for you have angered him.
"    "Pshaw! fear not," the other answered in the same low tone.
 "If I miss  one stoop I will strike him on the next.
 Mark me else.
 Fair cousin," he  continued, turning to the prince, "these be rare men-at-arms and lusty  bowmen.
 It would be hard indeed to match them.
"    "They have journeyed far, sire, but they have never yet found their  match.
"    "Nor ever will, I doubt not.
 I feel myself to be back upon my throne  when I look at them.
 But tell me, dear coz, what shall we do next,  when we have driven this bastard Henry from the kingdom which he hath  filched?"    "We shall then compel the King of Aragon to place our good friend and  brother James of Majorca upon the throne.
"    "Noble and generous prince!" cried the little monarch.
    "That done," said King Pedro, glancing out of the corners of his eyes  at the young conqueror, "we shall unite the forces of England, of  Aquitaine, of Spain and of Majorca.
 It would be shame to us if we did  not do some great deed with such forces ready to our hand.
"    "You say truly, brother," cried the prince, his eyes kindling at the  thought.
 "Methinks that we could not do anything more pleasing to Our  Lady than to drive the heathen Moors out of the country.
"    "I am with you, Edward, as true as hilt to blade.
 But, by St.
 James!  we shall not let these Moors make mock at us from over the sea.
 We must  take ship and thrust them from Africa.
"    "By heaven, yes!" cried the prince.
 "And it is the dream of my heart  that our English pennons shall wave upon the Mount of Olives, and the  lions and lilies float over the holy city.
"    "And why not, dear coz? Your bowmen have cleared a path to Paris, and  why not to Jerusalem? Once there, your arms might rest.
"    "Nay, there is more to be done," cried the prince, carried away by the  ambitious dream.
 "There is still the city of Constantine to be taken,  and war to be waged against the Soldan of Damascus.
 And beyond him again  there is tribute to be levied from the Cham of Tartary and from the  kingdom of Cathay.
 Ha! John, what say you? Can we not go as far eastward  as Richard of the Lion Heart?"    "Old John will bide at home, sire," said the rugged soldier.
 "By my  soul! as long as I am seneschal of Aquitaine I will find enough to do  in guarding the marches which you have entrusted to me.
 It would be  a blithe day for the King of France when he heard that the seas lay  between him and us.
"    "By my soul! John," said the prince, "I have never known you turn  laggard before.
"    "The babbling hound, sire, is not always the first at the mort," the old  knight answered.
    "Nay, my true-heart! I have tried you too often not to know.
 But, by my  soul! I have not seen so dense a throng since the day that we brought  King John down Cheapside.
"    It was indeed an enormous crowd which covered the whole vast plain from  the line of vineyards to the river bank.
 From the northern gate the  prince and his companions looked down at a dark sea of heads, brightened  here and there by the colored hoods of the women, or by the sparkling  head-pieces of archers and men-at-arms.
 In the centre of this vast  assemblage the lists seemed but a narrow strip of green marked out with  banners and streamers, while a gleam of white with a flutter of pennons  at either end showed where the marquees were pitched which served as the  dressing-rooms of the combatants.
 A path had been staked off from the  city gate to the stands which had been erected for the court and the  nobility.
 Down this, amid the shouts of the enormous multitude, the  prince cantered with his two attendant kings, his high officers of  state, and his long train of lords and ladies, courtiers, counsellors,  and soldiers, with toss of plume and flash of jewel, sheen of silk and  glint of gold--as rich and gallant a show as heart could wish.
 The head  of the cavalcade had reached the lists ere the rear had come clear of  the city gate, for the fairest and the bravest had assembled from all  the broad lands which are watered by the Dordogne and the Garonne.
 Here  rode dark-browed cavaliers from the sunny south, fiery soldiers from  Gascony, graceful courtiers of Limousin or Saintonge, and gallant young  Englishmen from beyond the seas.
 Here too were the beautiful brunettes  of the Gironde, with eyes which out-flashed their jewels, while beside  them rode their blonde sisters of England, clear cut and aquiline,  swathed in swans'-down and in ermine, for the air was biting though  the sun was bright.
 Slowly the long and glittering train wound into the  lists, until every horse had been tethered by the varlets in waiting,  and every lord and lady seated in the long stands which stretched, rich  in tapestry and velvet and blazoned arms, on either side of the centre  of the arena.
    The holders of the lists occupied the end which was nearest to the city  gate.
 There, in front of their respective pavilions, flew the martlets  of Audley, the roses of Loring, the scarlet bars of Wake, the lion of  the Percies and the silver wings of the Beauchamps, each supported by  a squire clad in hanging green stuff to represent so many Tritons, and  bearing a huge conch-shell in their left hands.
 Behind the tents the  great war-horses, armed at all points, champed and reared, while their  masters sat at the doors of their pavilions, with their helmets upon  their knees, chatting as to the order of the day's doings.
 The English  archers and men-at-arms had mustered at that end of the lists, but the  vast majority of the spectators were in favor of the attacking party,  for the English had declined in popularity ever since the bitter dispute  as to the disposal of the royal captive after the battle of Poictiers.
  Hence the applause was by no means general when the herald-at-arms  proclaimed, after a flourish of trumpets, the names and styles of the  knights who were prepared, for the honor of their country and for the  love of their ladies, to hold the field against all who might do them  the favor to run a course with them.
 On the other hand, a deafening  burst of cheering greeted the rival herald, who, advancing from the  other end of the lists, rolled forth the well-known titles of the five  famous warriors who had accepted the defiance.
    "Faith, John," said the prince, "it sounds as though you were right.
  Ha! my grace D'Armagnac, it seems that our friends on this side will not  grieve if our English champions lose the day.
"    "It may be so, sire," the Gascon nobleman answered.
 "I have little doubt  that in Smithfield or at Windsor an English crowd would favor their own  countrymen.
"    "By my faith! that's easily seen," said the prince, laughing, "for a few  score English archers at yonder end are bellowing as though they would  out-shout the mighty multitude.
 I fear that they will have little to  shout over this tourney, for my gold vase has small prospect of crossing  the water.
 What are the conditions, John?"    "They are to tilt singly not less than three courses, sire, and the  victory to rest with that party which shall have won the greater number  of courses, each pair continuing till one or other have the vantage.
 He  who carries himself best of the victors hath the prize, and he who is  judged best of the other party hath a jewelled clasp.
 Shall I order that  the nakirs sound, sire?"    The prince nodded, and the trumpets rang out, while the champions rode  forth one after the other, each meeting his opponent in the centre of  the lists.
 Sir William Beauchamp went down before the practiced lance  of the Captal de Buch.
 Sir Thomas Percy won the vantage over the Lord  of Mucident, and the Lord Audley struck Sir Perducas d'Albret from  the saddle.
 The burly De Clisson, however, restored the hopes of the  attackers by beating to the ground Sir Thomas Wake of Yorkshire.
 So far,  there was little to choose betwixt challengers and challenged.
    "By Saint James of Santiago!" cried Don Pedro, with a tinge of color  upon his pale cheeks, "win who will, this has been a most notable  contest.
"    "Who comes next for England, John?" asked the prince in a voice which  quivered with excitement.
    "Sir Nigel Loring of Hampshire, sire.
"    "Ha! he is a man of good courage, and skilled in the use of all  weapons.
"    "He is indeed, sire.
 But his eyes, like my own, are the worse for wars.
  Yet he can tilt or play his part at hand-strokes as merrily as ever.
 It  was he, sire, who won the golden crown which Queen Philippa, your royal  mother, gave to be jousted for by all the knights of England after  the harrying of Calais.
 I have heard that at Twynham Castle there is a  buffet which groans beneath the weight of his prizes.
"    "I pray that my vase may join them," said the prince.
 "But here is the  cavalier of Germany, and by my soul! he looks like a man of great valor  and hardiness.
 Let them run their full three courses, for the issue is  over-great to hang upon one.
"    As the prince spoke, amid a loud flourish of trumpets and the shouting  of the Gascon party, the last of the assailants rode gallantly into the  lists.
 He was a man of great size, clad in black armor without blazonry  or ornament of any kind, for all worldly display was forbidden by the  rules of the military brotherhood to which he belonged.
 No plume or  nobloy fluttered from his plain tilting salade, and even his lance was  devoid of the customary banderole.
 A white mantle fluttered behind him,  upon the left side of which was marked the broad black cross picked  out with silver which was the well-known badge of the Teutonic Order.
  Mounted upon a horse as large, as black, and as forbidding as himself,  he cantered slowly forward, with none of those prancings and gambades  with which a cavalier was accustomed to show his command over his  charger.
 Gravely and sternly he inclined his head to the prince, and  took his place at the further end of the arena.
    He had scarce done so before Sir Nigel rode out from the holders'  enclosure, and galloping at full speed down the lists, drew his charger  up before the prince's stand with a jerk which threw it back upon  its haunches.
 With white armor, blazoned shield, and plume of  ostrich-feathers from his helmet, he carried himself in so jaunty and  joyous a fashion, with tossing pennon and curveting charger, that a  shout of applause ran the full circle of the arena.
 With the air of a  man who hastes to a joyous festival, he waved his lance in salute, and  reining the pawing horse round without permitting its fore-feet to touch  the ground, he hastened back to his station.
    A great hush fell over the huge multitude as the two last champions  faced each other.
 A double issue seemed to rest upon their contest, for  their personal fame was at stake as well as their party's honor.
 Both  were famous warriors, but as their exploits had been performed in widely  sundered countries, they had never before been able to cross lances.
 A  course between such men would have been enough in itself to cause the  keenest interest, apart from its being the crisis which would decide who  should be the victors of the day.
 For a moment they waited--the German  sombre and collected, Sir Nigel quivering in every fibre with  eagerness and fiery resolution.
 Then, amid a long-drawn breath from  the spectators, the glove fell from the marshal's hand, and the two  steel-clad horsemen met like a thunderclap in front of the royal stand.
  The German, though he reeled for an instant before the thrust of the  Englishman, struck his opponent so fairly upon the vizor that the laces  burst, the plumed helmet flew to pieces, and Sir Nigel galloped on down  the lists with his bald head shimmering in the sunshine.
 A thousand  waving scarves and tossing caps announced that the first bout had fallen  to the popular party.
    The Hampshire knight was not a man to be disheartened by a reverse.
 He  spurred back to the pavilion, and was out in a few instants with another  helmet.
 The second course was so equal that the keenest judges could not  discern any vantage.
 Each struck fire from the other's shield, and each  endured the jarring shock as though welded to the horse beneath him.
 In  the final bout, however, Sir Nigel struck his opponent with so true an  aim that the point of the lance caught between the bars of his vizor and  tore the front of his helmet out, while the German, aiming somewhat  low, and half stunned by the shock, had the misfortune to strike his  adversary upon the thigh, a breach of the rules of the tilting-yard, by  which he not only sacrificed his chances of success, but would also  have forfeited his horse and his armor, had the English knight chosen  to claim them.
 A roar of applause from the English soldiers, with an  ominous silence from the vast crowd who pressed round the barriers,  announced that the balance of victory lay with the holders.
 Already the  ten champions had assembled in front of the prince to receive his award,  when a harsh bugle call from the further end of the lists drew all eyes  to a new and unexpected arrival.
        .
 HOW A CHAMPION CAME FORTH FROM THE EAST.
      The Bordeaux lists were, as has already been explained, situated  upon the plain near the river upon those great occasions when the  tilting-ground in front of the Abbey of St.
 Andrew's was deemed to be  too small to contain the crowd.
 On the eastern side of this plain the  country-side sloped upwards, thick with vines in summer, but now ridged  with the brown bare enclosures.
 Over the gently rising plain curved the  white road which leads inland, usually flecked with travellers, but now  with scarce a living form upon it, so completely had the lists drained  all the district of its inhabitants.
 Strange it was to see such a vast  concourse of people, and then to look upon that broad, white, empty  highway which wound away, bleak and deserted, until it narrowed itself  to a bare streak against the distant uplands.
    Shortly after the contest had begun, any one looking from the lists  along this road might have remarked, far away in the extreme distance,  two brilliant and sparkling points which glittered and twinkled in  the bright shimmer of the winter sun.
 Within an hour these had become  clearer and nearer, until they might be seen to come from the reflection  from the head-pieces of two horsemen who were riding at the top of their  speed in the direction of Bordeaux.
 Another half-hour had brought  them so close that every point of their bearing and equipment could be  discerned.
 The first was a knight in full armor, mounted upon a brown  horse with a white blaze upon breast and forehead.
 He was a short man of  great breadth of shoulder, with vizor closed, and no blazonry upon his  simple white surcoat or plain black shield.
 The other, who was evidently  his squire and attendant, was unarmed save for the helmet upon his  head, but bore in his right hand a very long and heavy oaken spear which  belonged to his master.
 In his left hand the squire held not only the  reins of his own horse but those of a great black war-horse, fully  harnessed, which trotted along at his side.
 Thus the three horses and  their two riders rode swiftly to the lists, and it was the blare of the  trumpet sounded by the squire as his lord rode into the arena which  had broken in upon the prize-giving and drawn away the attention and  interest of the spectators.
    "Ha, John!" cried the prince, craning his neck, "who is this cavalier,  and what is it that he desires?"    "On my word, sire," replied Chandos, with the utmost surprise upon his  face, "it is my opinion that he is a Frenchman.
"    "A Frenchman!" repeated Don Pedro.
 "And how can you tell that, my Lord  Chandos, when he has neither coat-armor, crest, or blazonry?"    "By his armor, sire, which is rounder at elbow and at shoulder than any  of Bordeaux or of England.
 Italian he might be were his bassinet more  sloped, but I will swear that those plates were welded betwixt this and  Rhine.
 Here comes his squire, however, and we shall hear what strange  fortune hath brought him over the marches.
"    As he spoke the attendant cantered up the grassy enclosure, and pulling  up his steed in front of the royal stand, blew a second fanfare upon  his bugle.
 He was a raw-boned, swarthy-cheeked man, with black bristling  beard and a swaggering bearing.
    Having sounded his call, he thrust the bugle into his belt, and, pushing  his way betwixt the groups of English and of Gascon knights, he reined  up within a spear's length of the royal party.
    "I come," he shouted in a hoarse, thick voice, with a strong Breton  accent, "as squire and herald from my master, who is a very valiant  pursuivant-of-arms, and a liegeman to the great and powerful monarch,  Charles, king of the French.
 My master has heard that there is jousting  here, and prospect of honorable advancement, so he has come to ask that  some English cavalier will vouchsafe for the love of his lady to run a  course with sharpened lances with him, or to meet him with sword, mace,  battle-axe, or dagger.
 He bade me say, however, that he would fight only  with a true Englishman, and not with any mongrel who is neither English  nor French, but speaks with the tongue of the one, and fights under the  banner of the other.
"    "Sir!" cried De Clisson, with a voice of thunder, while his countrymen  clapped their hands to their swords.
 The squire, however, took no notice  of their angry faces, but continued with his master's message.
    "He is now ready, sire," he said, "albeit his destrier has travelled  many miles this day, and fast, for we were in fear lest we come too late  for the jousting.
"    "Ye have indeed come too late," said the prince, "seeing that the prize  is about to be awarded; yet I doubt not that one of these gentlemen will  run a course for the sake of honor with this cavalier of France.
"    "And as to the prize, sire," quoth Sir Nigel, "I am sure that I speak  for all when I say this French knight hath our leave to bear it away  with him if he can fairly win it.
"    "Bear word of this to your master," said the prince, "and ask him which  of these five Englishmen he would desire to meet.
 But stay; your master  bears no coat-armor, and we have not yet heard his name.
"    "My master, sire, is under vow to the Virgin neither to reveal his name  nor to open his vizor until he is back upon French ground once more.
"    "Yet what assurance have we," said the prince, "that this is not some  varlet masquerading in his master's harness, or some caitiff knight,  the very touch of whose lance might bring infamy upon an honorable  gentleman?"    "It is not so, sire," cried the squire earnestly.
 "There is no man upon  earth who would demean himself by breaking a lance with my master.
"    "You speak out boldly, squire," the prince answered; "but unless I have  some further assurance of your master's noble birth and gentle name I  cannot match the choicest lances of my court against him.
"    "You refuse, sire?"    "I do refuse.
"    "Then, sire, I was bidden to ask you from my master whether you would  consent if Sir John Chandos, upon hearing my master's name, should  assure you that he was indeed a man with whom you might yourself cross  swords without indignity.
"    "I ask no better," said the prince.
    "Then I must ask, Lord Chandos, that you will step forth.
 I have your  pledge that the name shall remain ever a secret, and that you will  neither say nor write one word which might betray it.
 The name is----"  He stooped down from his horse and whispered something into the old  knight's ear which made him start with surprise, and stare with much  curiosity at the distant Knight, who was sitting his charger at the  further end of the arena.
    "Is this indeed sooth?" he exclaimed.
    "It is, my lord, and I swear it by St.
 Ives of Brittany.
"    "I might have known it," said Chandos, twisting his moustache, and still  looking thoughtfully at the cavalier.
    "What then, Sir John?" asked the prince.
    "Sire, this is a knight whom it is indeed great honor to meet, and I  would that your grace would grant me leave to send my squire for my  harness, for I would dearly love to run a course with him.
"    "Nay, nay, Sir John, you have gained as much honor as one man can bear,  and it were hard if you could not rest now.
 But I pray you, squire, to  tell your master that he is very welcome to our court, and that wines  and spices will be served him, if he would refresh himself before  jousting.
"    "My master will not drink," said the squire.
    "Let him then name the gentleman with whom he would break a spear.
"    "He would contend with these five knights, each to choose such weapons  as suit him best.
"    "I perceive," said the prince, "that your master is a man of great heart  and high of enterprise.
 But the sun already is low in the west, and  there will scarce be light for these courses.
 I pray you, gentlemen, to  take your places, that we may see whether this stranger's deeds are as  bold as his words.
"    The unknown knight had sat like a statue of steel, looking neither to  the right nor to the left during these preliminaries.
 He had changed  from the horse upon which he had ridden, and bestrode the black charger  which his squire had led beside him.
 His immense breadth, his stern  composed appearance, and the mode in which he handled his shield and his  lance, were enough in themselves to convince the thousands of critical  spectators that he was a dangerous opponent.
 Aylward, who stood in  the front row of the archers with Simon, big John, and others of the  Company, had been criticising the proceedings from the commencement with  the ease and freedom of a man who had spent his life under arms and had  learned in a hard school to know at a glance the points of a horse and  his rider.
 He stared now at the stranger with a wrinkled brow and the  air of a man who is striving to stir his memory.
    "By my hilt! I have seen the thick body of him before to-day.
 Yet I  cannot call to mind where it could have been.
 At Nogent belike, or was  it at Auray? Mark me, lads, this man will prove to be one of the best  lances of France, and there are no better in the world.
"    "It is but child's play, this poking game," said John.
 "I would fain  try my hand at it, for, by the black rood! I think that it might be  amended.
"    "What then would you do, John?" asked several.
    "There are many things which might be done," said the forester  thoughtfully.
 "Methinks that I would begin by breaking my spear.
"    "So they all strive to do.
"    "Nay, but not upon another man's shield.
 I would break it over my own  knee.
"    "And what the better for that, old beef and bones?" asked Black Simon.
    "So I would turn what is but a lady's bodkin of a weapon into a very  handsome club.
"    "And then, John?"    "Then I would take the other's spear into my arm or my leg, or where  it pleased him best to put it, and I would dash out his brains with my  club.
"    "By my ten finger-bones! old John," said Aylward, "I would give my  feather-bed to see you at a spear-running.
 This is a most courtly and  gentle sport which you have devised.
"    "So it seems to me," said John seriously.
 "Or, again, one might seize  the other round the middle, pluck him off his horse and bear him to the  pavilion, there to hold him to ransom.
"    "Good!" cried Simon, amid a roar of laughter from all the archers round.
  "By Thomas of Kent! we shall make a camp-marshal of thee, and thou  shalt draw up rules for our jousting.
 But, John, who is it that you  would uphold in this knightly and pleasing fashion?"    "What mean you?"    "Why, John, so strong and strange a tilter must fight for the brightness  of his lady's eyes or the curve of her eyelash, even as Sir Nigel does  for the Lady Loring.
"    "I know not about that," said the big archer, scratching his head in  perplexity.
 "Since Mary hath played me false, I can scarce fight for  her.
"    "Yet any woman will serve.
"    "There is my mother then," said John.
 "She was at much pains at my  upbringing, and, by my soul! I will uphold the curve of her eyelashes,  for it tickleth my very heart-root to think of her.
 But who is here?"    "It is Sir William Beauchamp.
 He is a valiant man, but I fear that he is  scarce firm enough upon the saddle to bear the thrust of such a tilter  as this stranger promises to be.
"    Aylward's words were speedily justified, for even as he spoke the two  knights met in the centre of the lists.
 Beauchamp struck his opponent a  shrewd blow upon the helmet, but was met with so frightful a thrust that  he whirled out of his saddle and rolled over and over upon the ground.
  Sir Thomas Percy met with little better success, for his shield was  split, his vambrace torn and he himself wounded slightly in the side.
  Lord Audley and the unknown knight struck each other fairly upon the  helmet; but, while the stranger sat as firm and rigid as ever upon his  charger, the Englishman was bent back to his horse's cropper by the  weight of the blow, and had galloped half-way down the lists ere he  could recover himself.
 Sir Thomas Wake was beaten to the ground with a  battle-axe--that being the weapon which he had selected--and had to be  carried to his pavilion.
 These rapid successes, gained one after the  other over four celebrated warriors, worked the crowd up to a pitch of  wonder and admiration.
 Thunders of applause from the English soldiers,  as well as from the citizens and peasants, showed how far the love of  brave and knightly deeds could rise above the rivalries of race.
    "By my soul! John," cried the prince, with his cheek flushed and his  eyes shining, "this is a man of good courage and great hardiness.
 I  could not have thought that there was any single arm upon earth which  could have overthrown these four champions.
"    "He is indeed, as I have said, sire, a knight from whom much honor is to  be gained.
 But the lower edge of the sun is wet, and it will be beneath  the sea ere long.
"    "Here is Sir Nigel Loring, on foot and with his sword," said the prince.
  "I have heard that he is a fine swordsman.
"    "The finest in your army, sire," Chandos answered.
 "Yet I doubt not that  he will need all his skill this day.
"    As he spoke, the two combatants advanced from either end in full armor  with their two-handed swords sloping over their shoulders.
 The stranger  walked heavily and with a measured stride, while the English knight  advanced as briskly as though there was no iron shell to weigh down the  freedom of his limbs.
 At four paces distance they stopped, eyed each  other for a moment, and then in an instant fell to work with a clatter  and clang as though two sturdy smiths were busy upon their anvils.
 Up  and down went the long, shining blades, round and round they circled in  curves of glimmering light, crossing, meeting, disengaging, with flash  of sparks at every parry.
 Here and there bounded Sir Nigel, his head  erect, his jaunty plume fluttering in the air, while his dark opponent  sent in crashing blow upon blow, following fiercely up with cut and with  thrust, but never once getting past the practised blade of the skilled  swordsman.
 The crowd roared with delight as Sir Nigel would stoop his  head to avoid a blow, or by some slight movement of his body allow some  terrible thrust to glance harmlessly past him.
 Suddenly, however, his  time came.
 The Frenchman, whirling up his sword, showed for an instant  a chink betwixt his shoulder piece and the rerebrace which guarded his  upper arm.
 In dashed Sir Nigel, and out again so swiftly that the eye  could not follow the quick play of his blade, but a trickle of blood  from the stranger's shoulder, and a rapidly widening red smudge upon his  white surcoat, showed where the thrust had taken effect.
 The wound was,  however, but a slight one, and the Frenchman was about to renew his  onset, when, at a sign from the prince, Chandos threw down his baton,  and the marshals of the lists struck up the weapons and brought the  contest to an end.
    "It were time to check it," said the prince, smiling, "for Sir Nigel is  too good a man for me to lose, and, by the five holy wounds! if one of  those cuts came home I should have fears for our champion.
 What think  you, Pedro?"    "I think, Edward, that the little man was very well able to take care of  himself.
 For my part, I should wish to see so well matched a pair fight  on while a drop of blood remained in their veins.
"    "We must have speech with him.
 Such a man must not go from my court  without rest or sup.
 Bring him hither, Chandos, and, certes, if the Lord  Loring hath resigned his claim upon this goblet, it is right and proper  that this cavalier should carry it to France with him as a sign of the  prowess that he has shown this day.
"    As he spoke, the knight-errant, who had remounted his warhorse, galloped  forward to the royal stand, with a silken kerchief bound round his  wounded arm.
 The setting sun cast a ruddy glare upon his burnished  arms, and sent his long black shadow streaming behind him up the level  clearing.
 Pulling up his steed, he slightly inclined his head, and  sat in the stern and composed fashion with which he had borne himself  throughout, heedless of the applauding shouts and the flutter of  kerchiefs from the long lines of brave men and of fair women who were  looking down upon him.
    "Sir knight," said the prince, "we have all marvelled this day at this  great skill and valor with which God has been pleased to endow you.
  I would fain that you should tarry at our court, for a time at least,  until your hurt is healed and your horses rested.
"    "My hurt is nothing, sire, nor are my horses weary," returned the  stranger in a deep, stern voice.
    "Will you not at least hie back to Bordeaux with us, that you may drain  a cup of muscadine and sup at our table?"    "I will neither drink your wine nor sit at your table," returned the  other.
 "I bear no love for you or for your race, and there is nought  that I wish at your hands until the day when I see the last sail which  bears you back to your island vanishing away against the western sky.
"    "These are bitter words, sir knight," said Prince Edward, with an angry  frown.
    "And they come from a bitter heart," answered the unknown knight.
 "How  long is it since there has been peace in my hapless country? Where are  the steadings, and orchards, and vineyards, which made France fair?  Where are the cities which made her great? From Providence to Burgundy  we are beset by every prowling hireling in Christendom, who rend and  tear the country which you have left too weak to guard her own marches.
  Is it not a by-word that a man may ride all day in that unhappy land  without seeing thatch upon roof or hearing the crow of cock? Does not  one fair kingdom content you, that you should strive so for this other  one which has no love for you? Pardieu! a true Frenchman's words may  well be bitter, for bitter is his lot and bitter his thoughts as he  rides through his thrice unhappy country.
"    "Sir knight," said the prince, "you speak like a brave man, and our  cousin of France is happy in having a cavalier who is so fit to uphold  his cause either with tongue or with sword.
 But if you think such evil  of us, how comes it that you have trusted yourselves to us without  warranty or safe-conduct?"    "Because I knew that you would be here, sire.
 Had the man who sits upon  your right been ruler of this land, I had indeed thought twice before I  looked to him for aught that was knightly or generous.
" With a soldierly  salute, he wheeled round his horse, and, galloping down the lists,  disappeared amid the dense crowd of footmen and of horsemen who were  streaming away from the scene of the tournament.
    "The insolent villain!" cried Pedro, glaring furiously after him.
 "I  have seen a man's tongue torn from his jaws for less.
 Would it not be  well even now, Edward, to send horsemen to hale him back? Bethink you  that it may be one of the royal house of France, or at least some knight  whose loss would be a heavy blow to his master.
 Sir William Felton, you  are well mounted, gallop after the caitiff, I pray you.
"    "Do so, Sir William," said the prince, "and give him this purse of a  hundred nobles as a sign of the respect which I bear for him; for,  by St.
 George! he has served his master this day even as I would wish  liegeman of mine to serve me.
" So saying, the prince turned his back  upon the King of Spain, and springing upon his horse, rode slowly  homewards to the Abbey of Saint Andrew's.
        .
 HOW SIR NIGEL WROTE TO TWYNHAM CASTLE.
      On the morning after the jousting, when Alleyne Edricson went, as was  his custom, into his master's chamber to wait upon him in his dressing  and to curl his hair, he found him already up and very busily at work.
  He sat at a table by the window, a deer-hound on one side of him and a  lurcher on the other, his feet tucked away under the trestle on which  he sat, and his tongue in his cheek, with the air of a man who is much  perplexed.
 A sheet of vellum lay upon the board in front of him, and  he held a pen in his hand, with which he had been scribbling in a rude  schoolboy hand.
 So many were the blots, however, and so numerous the  scratches and erasures, that he had at last given it up in despair, and  sat with his single uncovered eye cocked upwards at the ceiling, as one  who waits upon inspiration.
    "By Saint Paul!" he cried, as Alleyne entered, "you are the man who will  stand by me in this matter.
 I have been in sore need of you, Alleyne.
"    "God be with you, my fair lord!" the squire answered.
 "I trust that you  have taken no hurt from all that you have gone through yesterday.
"    "Nay; I feel the fresher for it, Alleyne.
 It has eased my joints, which  were somewhat stiff from these years of peace.
 I trust, Alleyne, that  thou didst very carefully note and mark the bearing and carriage of  this knight of France; for it is time, now when you are young, that you  should see all that is best, and mould your own actions in accordance.
  This was a man from whom much honor might be gained, and I have seldom  met any one for whom I have conceived so much love and esteem.
 Could  I but learn his name, I should send you to him with my cartel, that we  might have further occasion to watch his goodly feats of arms.
"    "It is said, my fair lord, that none know his name save only the Lord  Chandos, and that he is under vow not to speak it.
 So ran the gossip at  the squires' table.
"    "Be he who he might, he was a very hardy gentleman.
 But I have a task  here, Alleyne, which is harder to me than aught that was set before me  yesterday.
"    "Can I help you, my lord?"    "That indeed you can.
 I have been writing my greetings to my sweet wife;  for I hear that a messenger goes from the prince to Southampton within  the week, and he would gladly take a packet for me.
 I pray you, Alleyne,  to cast your eyes upon what I have written, and see it they are such  words as my lady will understand.
 My fingers, as you can see, are more  used to iron and leather than to the drawing of strokes and turning of  letters.
 What then? Is there aught amiss, that you should stare so?"    "It is this first word, my lord.
 In what tongue were you pleased to  write?"    "In English; for my lady talks it more than she doth French.
    "Yet this is no English word, my sweet lord.
 Here are four t's and never  a letter betwixt them.
"    "By St.
 Paul! it seemed strange to my eye when I wrote it," said Sir  Nigel.
 "They bristle up together like a clump of lances.
 We must break  their ranks and set them farther apart.
 The word is 'that.
' Now I will  read it to you, Alleyne, and you shall write it out fair; for we leave  Bordeaux this day, and it would be great joy to me to think that the  Lady Loring had word from me.
"    Alleyne sat down as ordered, with a pen in his hand and a fresh sheet  of parchment before him, while Sir Nigel slowly spelled out his letter,  running his forefinger on from word to word.
    "That my heart is with thee, my dear sweeting, is what thine own heart  will assure thee of.
 All is well with us here, save that Pepin hath  the mange on his back, and Pommers hath scarce yet got clear of his  stiffness from being four days on ship-board, and the more so because  the sea was very high, and we were like to founder on account of a hole  in her side, which was made by a stone cast at us by certain sea-rovers,  who may the saints have in their keeping, for they have gone from  amongst us, as has young Terlake, and two-score mariners and archers,  who would be the more welcome here as there is like to be a very fine  war, with much honor and all hopes of advancement, for which I go to  gather my Company together, who are now at Montaubon, where they pillage  and destroy; yet I hope that, by God's help, I may be able to show that  I am their master, even as, my sweet lady, I am thy servant.
"    "How of that, Alleyne?" continued Sir Nigel, blinking at his squire,  with an expression of some pride upon his face.
 "Have I not told her all  that hath befallen us?"    "You have said much, my fair lord; and yet, if I may say so, it is  somewhat crowded together, so that my Lady Loring can, mayhap, scarce  follow it.
 Were it in shorter periods----"    "Nay, it boots me not how you marshal them, as long as they are all  there at the muster.
 Let my lady have the words, and she will place  them in such order as pleases her best.
 But I would have you add what it  would please her to know.
"    "That will I," said Alleyne, blithely, and bent to the task.
    "My fair lady and mistress," he wrote, "God hath had us in His keeping,  and my lord is well and in good cheer.
 He hath won much honor at the  jousting before the prince, when he alone was able to make it good  against a very valiant man from France.
 Touching the moneys, there is  enough and to spare until we reach Montaubon.
 Herewith, my fair lady,  I send my humble regards, entreating you that you will give the same  to your daughter, the Lady Maude.
 May the holy saints have you both in  their keeping is ever the prayer of thy servant,            "ALLEYNE EDRICSON.
"    "That is very fairly set forth," said Sir Nigel, nodding his bald head  as each sentence was read to him.
 "And for thyself, Alleyne, if there be  any dear friend to whom you would fain give greeting, I can send it for  thee within this packet.
"    "There is none," said Alleyne, sadly.
    "Have you no kinsfolk, then?"    "None, save my brother.
"    "Ha! I had forgotten that there was ill blood betwixt you.
 But are there  none in all England who love thee?"    "None that I dare say so.
"    "And none whom you love?"    "Nay, I will not say that," said Alleyne.
    Sir Nigel shook his head and laughed softly to himself, "I see how it  is with you," he said.
 "Have I not noted your frequent sighs and vacant  eye? Is she fair?"    "She is indeed," cried Alleyne from his heart, all tingling at this  sudden turn of the talk.
    "And good?"    "As an angel.
"    "And yet she loves you not?"    "Nay, I cannot say that she loves another.
"    "Then you have hopes?"    "I could not live else.
"    "Then must you strive to be worthy of her love.
 Be brave and pure,  fearless to the strong and humble to the weak; and so, whether this love  prosper or no, you will have fitted yourself to be honored by a maiden's  love, which is, in sooth, the highest guerdon which a true knight can  hope for.
"    "Indeed, my lord, I do so strive," said Alleyne; "but she is so sweet,  so dainty, and of so noble a spirit, that I fear me that I shall never  be worthy of her.
"    "By thinking so you become worthy.
 Is she then of noble birth?"    "She is, my lord," faltered Alleyne.
    "Of a knightly house?"    "Yes.
"    "Have a care, Alleyne, have a care!" said Sir Nigel, kindly.
 "The higher  the steed the greater the fall.
 Hawk not at that which may be beyond thy  flight.
"    "My lord, I know little of the ways and usages of the world," cried  Alleyne, "but I would fain ask your rede upon the matter.
 You have known  my father and my kin: is not my family one of good standing and repute?"    "Beyond all question.
"    "And yet you warn me that I must not place my love too high.
"    "Were Minstead yours, Alleyne, then, by St.
 Paul! I cannot think that  any family in the land would not be proud to take you among them, seeing  that you come of so old a strain.
 But while the Socman lives----Ha, by  my soul! if this is not Sir Oliver's step I am the more mistaken.
"    As he spoke, a heavy footfall was heard without, and the portly knight  flung open the door and strode into the room.
    "Why, my little coz," said he, "I have come across to tell you that  I live above the barber's in the Rue de la Tour, and that there is a  venison pasty in the oven and two flasks of the right vintage on the  table.
 By St.
 James! a blind man might find the place, for one has but  to get in the wind from it, and follow the savory smell.
 Put on your  cloak, then, and come, for Sir Walter Hewett and Sir Robert Briquet,  with one or two others, are awaiting us.
"    "Nay, Oliver, I cannot be with you, for I must to Montaubon this day.
"    "To Montaubon? But I have heard that your Company is to come with my  forty Winchester rascals to Dax.
"    "If you will take charge of them, Oliver.
 For I will go to Montaubon  with none save my two squires and two archers.
 Then, when I have found  the rest of my Company I shall lead them to Dax.
 We set forth this  morning.
"    "Then I must back to my pasty," said Sir Oliver.
 "You will find us at  Dax, I doubt not, unless the prince throw me into prison, for he is very  wroth against me.
"    "And why, Oliver?"    "Pardieu! because I have sent my cartel, gauntlet, and defiance to Sir  John Chandos and to Sir William Felton.
"    "To Chandos? In God's name, Oliver, why have you done this?"    "Because he and the other have used me despitefully.
"    "And how?"    "Because they have passed me over in choosing those who should joust for  England.
 Yourself and Audley I could pass, coz, for you are mature men;  but who are Wake, and Percy, and Beauchamp? By my soul! I was prodding  for my food into a camp-kettle when they were howling for their pap.
 Is  a man of my weight and substance to be thrown aside for the first three  half-grown lads who have learned the trick of the tilt-yard? But hark  ye, coz, I think of sending my cartel also to the prince.
"    "Oliver! Oliver! You are mad!"    "Not I, i' faith! I care not a denier whether he be prince or no.
 By  Saint James! I see that your squire's eyes are starting from his head  like a trussed crab.
 Well, friend, we are all three men of Hampshire,  and not lightly to be jeered at.
"    "Has he jeered at you than?"    "Pardieu! yes, 'Old Sir Oliver's heart is still stout,' said one of his  court.
 'Else had it been out of keeping with the rest of him,' quoth the  prince.
 'And his arm is strong,' said another.
 'So is the backbone of  his horse,' quoth the prince.
 This very day I will send him my cartel  and defiance.
"    "Nay, nay, my dear Oliver," said Sir Nigel, laying his hand upon his  angry friend's arm.
 "There is naught in this, for it was but saying that  you were a strong and robust man, who had need of a good destrier.
 And  as to Chandos and Felton, bethink you that if when you yourself were  young the older lances had ever been preferred, how would you then have  had the chance to earn the good name and fame which you now bear? You do  not ride as light as you did, Oliver, and I ride lighter by the weight  of my hair, but it would be an ill thing if in the evening of our lives  we showed that our hearts were less true and loyal than of old.
 If such  a knight as Sir Oliver Buttesthorn may turn against his own prince for  the sake of a light word, then where are we to look for steadfast faith  and constancy?"    "Ah! my dear little coz, it is easy to sit in the sunshine and preach to  the man in the shadow.
 Yet you could ever win me over to your side with  that soft voice of yours.
 Let us think no more of it then.
 But, holy  Mother! I had forgot the pasty, and it will be as scorched as Judas  Iscariot! Come, Nigel, lest the foul fiend get the better of me again.
"    "For one hour, then; for we march at mid-day.
 Tell Aylward, Alleyne,  that he is to come with me to Montaubon, and to choose one archer for  his comrade.
 The rest will to Dax when the prince starts, which will be  before the feast of the Epiphany.
 Have Pommers ready at mid-day with my  sycamore lance, and place my harness on the sumpter mule.
"    With these brief directions, the two old soldiers strode off together,  while Alleyne hastened to get all in order for their journey.
        .
 HOW THE THREE COMRADES GAINED A MIGHTY TREASURE      It was a bright, crisp winter's day when the little party set off from  Bordeaux on their journey to Montaubon, where the missing half of their  Company had last been heard of.
 Sir Nigel and Ford had ridden on in  advance, the knight upon his hackney, while his great war-horse trotted  beside his squire.
 Two hours later Alleyne Edricson followed; for he had  the tavern reckoning to settle, and many other duties which fell to him  as squire of the body.
 With him came Aylward and Hordle John, armed  as of old, but mounted for their journey upon a pair of clumsy Landes  horses, heavy-headed and shambling, but of great endurance, and capable  of jogging along all day, even when between the knees of the huge  archer, who turned the scale at two hundred and seventy pounds.
 They  took with them the sumpter mules, which carried in panniers the wardrobe  and table furniture of Sir Nigel; for the knight, though neither fop nor  epicure, was very dainty in small matters, and loved, however bare the  board or hard the life, that his napery should still be white and his  spoon of silver.
    There had been frost during the night, and the white hard road rang loud  under their horses' irons as they spurred through the east gate of the  town, along the same broad highway which the unknown French champion  had traversed on the day of the jousts.
 The three rode abreast, Alleyne  Edricson with his eyes cast down and his mind distrait, for his thoughts  were busy with the conversation which he had had with Sir Nigel in the  morning.
 Had he done well to say so much, or had he not done better to  have said more? What would the knight have said had he confessed to his  love for the Lady Maude? Would he cast him off in disgrace, or might he  chide him as having abused the shelter of his roof? It had been ready  upon his tongue to tell him all when Sir Oliver had broken in upon them.
  Perchance Sir Nigel, with his love of all the dying usages of chivalry,  might have contrived some strange ordeal or feat of arms by which his  love should be put to the test.
 Alleyne smiled as he wondered what  fantastic and wondrous deed would be exacted from him.
 Whatever it was,  he was ready for it, whether it were to hold the lists in the court of  the King of Tartary, to carry a cartel to the Sultan of Baghdad, or to  serve a term against the wild heathen of Prussia.
 Sir Nigel had said  that his birth was high enough for any lady, if his fortune could but  be amended.
 Often had Alleyne curled his lip at the beggarly craving for  land or for gold which blinded man to the higher and more lasting issues  of life.
 Now it seemed as though it were only by this same land and gold  that he might hope to reach his heart's desire.
 But then, again, the  Socman of Minstead was no friend to the Constable of Twynham Castle.
 It  might happen that, should he amass riches by some happy fortune of war,  this feud might hold the two families aloof.
 Even if Maude loved him, he  knew her too well to think that she would wed him without the blessing  of her father.
 Dark and murky was it all, but hope mounts high in youth,  and it ever fluttered over all the turmoil of his thoughts like a white  plume amid the shock of horsemen.
    If Alleyne Edricson had enough to ponder over as he rode through the  bare plains of Guienne, his two companions were more busy with the  present and less thoughtful of the future.
 Aylward rode for half a mile  with his chin upon his shoulder, looking back at a white kerchief which  fluttered out of the gable window of a high house which peeped over the  corner of the battlements.
 When at last a dip of the road hid it from  his view, he cocked his steel cap, shrugged his broad shoulders, and  rode on with laughter in his eyes, and his weather-beaten face all  ashine with pleasant memories.
 John also rode in silence, but his eyes  wandered slowly from one side of the road to the other, and he stared  and pondered and nodded his head like a traveller who makes his notes  and saves them up for the re-telling.
    "By the rood!" he broke out suddenly, slapping his thigh with his great  red hand, "I knew that there was something a-missing, but I could not  bring to my mind what it was.
"    "What was it then?" asked Alleyne, coming with a start out of his  reverie.
    "Why, it is the hedgerows," roared John, with a shout of laughter.
 "The  country is all scraped as clear as a friar's poll.
 But indeed I cannot  think much of the folk in these parts.
 Why do they not get to work and  dig up these long rows of black and crooked stumps which I see on every  hand? A franklin of Hampshire would think shame to have such litter upon  his soil.
"    "Thou foolish old John!" quoth Aylward.
 "You should know better, since  I have heard that the monks of Beaulieu could squeeze a good cup of  wine from their own grapes.
 Know then that if these rows were dug up  the wealth of the country would be gone, and mayhap there would be dry  throats and gaping mouths in England, for in three months' time these  black roots will blossom and shoot and burgeon, and from them will come  many a good ship-load of Medoc and Gascony which will cross the narrow  seas.
 But see the church in the hollow, and the folk who cluster in the  churchyard! By my hilt! it is a burial, and there is a passing bell!"  He pulled off his steel cap as he spoke and crossed himself, with a  muttered prayer for the repose of the dead.
    "There too," remarked Alleyne, as they rode on again, "that which seems  to the eye to be dead is still full of the sap of life, even as the  vines were.
 Thus God hath written Himself and His laws very broadly on  all that is around us, if our poor dull eyes and duller souls could but  read what He hath set before us.
"    "Ha! mon petit," cried the bowman, "you take me back to the days when  you were new fledged, as sweet a little chick as ever pecked his way  out of a monkish egg.
 I had feared that in gaining our debonair young  man-at-arms we had lost our soft-spoken clerk.
 In truth, I have noted  much change in you since we came from Twynham Castle.
"    "Surely it would be strange else, seeing that I have lived in a world  so new to me.
 Yet I trust that there are many things in which I have not  changed.
 If I have turned to serve an earthly master, and to carry arms  for an earthly king, it would be an ill thing if I were to lose all  thought of the great high King and Master of all, whose humble and  unworthy servant I was ere ever I left Beaulieu.
 You, John, are also  from the cloisters, but I trow that you do not feel that you have  deserted the old service in taking on the new.
"    "I am a slow-witted man," said John, "and, in sooth, when I try to think  about such matters it casts a gloom upon me.
 Yet I do not look upon  myself as a worse man in an archer's jerkin than I was in a white cowl,  if that be what you mean.
"    "You have but changed from one white company to the other," quoth  Aylward.
 "But, by these ten finger-bones! it is a passing strange thing  to me to think that it was but in the last fall of the leaf that we  walked from Lyndhurst together, he so gentle and maidenly, and you,  John, like a great red-limbed overgrown moon-calf; and now here you  are as sprack a squire and as lusty an archer as ever passed down the  highway from Bordeaux, while I am still the same old Samkin Aylward,  with never a change, save that I have a few more sins on my soul and a  few less crowns in my pouch.
 But I have never yet heard, John, what the  reason was why you should come out of Beaulieu.
"    "There were seven reasons," said John thoughtfully.
 "The first of them  was that they threw me out.
"    "Ma foi! camarade, to the devil with the other six! That is enough for  me and for thee also.
 I can see that they are very wise and discreet  folk at Beaulieu.
 Ah! mon ange, what have you in the pipkin?"    "It is milk, worthy sir," answered the peasant-maid, who stood by the  door of a cottage with a jug in her hand.
 "Would it please you, gentles,  that I should bring you out three horns of it?"    "Nay, ma petite, but here is a two-sous piece for thy kindly tongue and  for the sight of thy pretty face.
 Ma foi! but she has a bonne mine.
 I  have a mind to bide and speak with her.
"    "Nay, nay, Aylward," cried Alleyne.
 "Sir Nigel will await us, and he in  haste.
"    "True, true, camarade! Adieu, ma cherie! mon coeur est toujours a  toi.
 Her mother is a well-grown woman also.
 See where she digs by the  wayside.
 Ma foi! the riper fruit is ever the sweeter.
 Bon jour, ma belle  dame! God have you in his keeping! Said Sir Nigel where he would await  us?"    "At Marmande or Aiguillon.
 He said that we could not pass him, seeing  that there is but the one road.
"    "Aye, and it is a road that I know as I know the Midhurst parish  butts," quoth the bowman.
 "Thirty times have I journeyed it, forward and  backward, and, by the twang of string! I am wont to come back this way  more laden than I went.
 I have carried all that I had into France in  a wallet, and it hath taken four sumpter-mules to carry it back again.
  God's benison on the man who first turned his hand to the making of war!  But there, down in the dingle, is the church of Cardillac, and you may  see the inn where three poplars grow beyond the village.
 Let us on, for  a stoup of wine would hearten us upon our way.
"    The highway had lain through the swelling vineyard country, which  stretched away to the north and east in gentle curves, with many a  peeping spire and feudal tower, and cluster of village houses, all clear  cut and hard in the bright wintry air.
 To their right stretched the blue  Garonne, running swiftly seawards, with boats and barges dotted over its  broad bosom.
 On the other side lay a strip of vineyard, and beyond it  the desolate and sandy region of the Landes, all tangled with faded  gorse and heath and broom, stretching away in unbroken gloom to the blue  hills which lay low upon the furthest sky-line.
 Behind them might still  be seen the broad estuary of the Gironde, with the high towers of  Saint Andre and Saint Remi shooting up from the plain.
 In front, amid  radiating lines of poplars, lay the riverside townlet of Cardillac--gray  walls, white houses, and a feather of blue smoke.
    "This is the 'Mouton d'Or,'" said Aylward, as they pulled up their  horses at a whitewashed straggling hostel.
 "What ho there!" he  continued, beating upon the door with the hilt of his sword.
 "Tapster,  ostler, varlet, hark hither, and a wannion on your lazy limbs! Ha!  Michel, as red in the nose as ever! Three jacks of the wine of the  country, Michel--for the air bites shrewdly.
 I pray you, Alleyne, to  take note of this door, for I have a tale concerning it.
"    "Tell me, friend," said Alleyne to the portly red-faced inn-keeper, "has  a knight and a squire passed this way within the hour?"    "Nay, sir, it would be two hours back.
 Was he a small man, weak in the  eyes, with a want of hair, and speaks very quiet when he is most to be  feared?"    "The same," the squire answered.
 "But I marvel how you should know how  he speaks when he is in wrath, for he is very gentle-minded with those  who are beneath him.
"    "Praise to the saints! it was not I who angered him," said the fat  Michel.
    "Who, then?"    "It was young Sieur de Crespigny of Saintonge, who chanced to be here,  and made game of the Englishman, seeing that he was but a small man and  hath a face which is full of peace.
 But indeed this good knight was a  very quiet and patient man, for he saw that the Sieur de Crespigny  was still young and spoke from an empty head, so he sat his horse  and quaffed his wine, even as you are doing now, all heedless of the  clacking tongue.
"    "And what then, Michel?"    "Well, messieurs, it chanced that the Sieur de Crespigny, having said  this and that, for the laughter of the varlets, cried out at last about  the glove that the knight wore in his coif, asking if it was the custom  in England for a man to wear a great archer's glove in his cap.
 Pardieu!  I have never seen a man get off his horse as quick as did that stranger  Englishman.
 Ere the words were past the other's lips he was beside him,  his face nigh touching, and his breath hot upon his cheeks.
 'I think,  young sir,' quoth he softly, looking into the other's eyes, 'that now  that I am nearer you will very clearly see that the glove is not an  archer's glove.
' 'Perchance not,' said the Sieur de Crespigny with a  twitching lip.
 'Nor is it large, but very small,' quoth the Englishman.
  'Less large than I had thought,' said the other, looking down, for the  knight's gaze was heavy upon his eyelids.
 'And in every way such a glove  as might be worn by the fairest and sweetest lady in England,' quoth  the Englishman.
 'It may be so,' said the Sieur de Crespigny, turning his  face from him.
 'I am myself weak in the eyes, and have often taken one  thing for another,' quoth the knight, as he sprang back into his saddle  and rode off, leaving the Sieur de Crespigny biting his nails before the  door.
 Ha! by the five wounds, many men of war have drunk my wine, but  never one was more to my fancy than this little Englishman.
"    "By my hilt! he is our master, Michel," quoth Aylward, "and such men as  we do not serve under a laggart.
 But here are four deniers, Michel, and  God be with you! En avant, camarades! for we have a long road before  us.
"    At a brisk trot the three friends left Cardillac and its wine-house  behind them, riding without a halt past St.
 Macaire, and on by ferry  over the river Dorpt.
 At the further side the road winds through La  Reolle, Bazaille, and Marmande, with the sunlit river still gleaming  upon the right, and the bare poplars bristling up upon either side.
 John  and Alleyne rode silent on either side, but every inn, farm-steading,  or castle brought back to Aylward some remembrance of love, foray, or  plunder, with which to beguile the way.
    "There is the smoke from Bazas, on the further side of Garonne," quoth  he.
 "There were three sisters yonder, the daughters of a farrier, and,  by these ten finger-bones! a man might ride for a long June day and  never set eyes upon such maidens.
 There was Marie, tall and grave, and  Blanche petite and gay, and the dark Agnes, with eyes that went through  you like a waxed arrow.
 I lingered there as long as four days, and was  betrothed to them all; for it seemed shame to set one above her sisters,  and might make ill blood in the family.
 Yet, for all my care, things  were not merry in the house, and I thought it well to come away.
 There,  too, is the mill of Le Souris.
 Old Pierre Le Caron, who owned it, was a  right good comrade, and had ever a seat and a crust for a weary archer.
  He was a man who wrought hard at all that he turned his hand to; but he  heated himself in grinding bones to mix with his flour, and so through  over-diligence he brought a fever upon himself and died.
"    "Tell me, Aylward," said Alleyne, "what was amiss with the door of  yonder inn that you should ask me to observe it.
"    "Pardieu! yes, I had well-nigh forgot.
 What saw you on yonder door?"    "I saw a square hole, through which doubtless the host may peep when he  is not too sure of those who knock.
"    "And saw you naught else?"    "I marked that beneath this hole there was a deep cut in the door, as  though a great nail had been driven in.
"    "And naught else?"    "No.
"    "Had you looked more closely you might have seen that there was a stain  upon the wood.
 The first time that I ever heard my comrade Black Simon  laugh was in front of that door.
 I heard him once again when he slew a  French squire with his teeth, he being unarmed and the Frenchman having  a dagger.
"    "And why did Simon laugh in front of the inn-door!" asked John.
    "Simon is a hard and perilous man when he hath the bitter drop in him;  and, by my hilt! he was born for war, for there is little sweetness or  rest in him.
 This inn, the 'Mouton d'Or,' was kept in the old days by  one Francois Gourval, who had a hard fist and a harder heart.
 It was  said that many and many an archer coming from the wars had been served  with wine with simples in it, until he slept, and had then been stripped  of all by this Gourval.
 Then on the morrow, if he made complaint, this  wicked Gourval would throw him out upon the road or beat him, for he  was a very lusty man, and had many stout varlets in his service.
 This  chanced to come to Simon's ears when we were at Bordeaux together, and  he would have it that we should ride to Cardillac with a good hempen  cord, and give this Gourval such a scourging as he merited.
 Forth we  rode then, but when we came to the 'Mouton d'Or,' Gourval had had word of  our coming and its purpose, so that the door was barred, nor was there  any way into the house.
 'Let us in, good Master Gourval!' cried Simon,  and 'Let us in, good Master Gourval!' cried I, but no word could we get  through the hole in the door, save that he would draw an arrow upon us  unless we went on our way.
 'Well, Master Gourval,' quoth Simon at last,  'this is but a sorry welcome, seeing that we have ridden so far just to  shake you by the hand.
' 'Canst shake me by the hand without coming in,'  said Gourval.
 'And how that?' asked Simon.
 'By passing in your hand  through the hole,' said he.
 'Nay, my hand is wounded,' quoth Simon, 'and  of such a size that I cannot pass it in.
' 'That need not hinder,' said  Gourval, who was hot to be rid of us, 'pass in your left hand.
' 'But I  have something for thee, Gourval,' said Simon.
 'What then?' he asked.
  'There was an English archer who slept here last week of the name of  Hugh of Nutbourne.
' 'We have had many rogues here,' said Gourval.
 'His  conscience hath been heavy within him because he owes you a debt of  fourteen deniers, having drunk wine for which he hath never paid.
  For the easing of his soul, he asked me to pay the money to you as I  passed.
' Now this Gourval was very greedy for money, so he thrust forth  his hand for the fourteen deniers, but Simon had his dagger ready and  he pinned his hand to the door.
 'I have paid the Englishman's debt,  Gourval!' quoth he, and so rode away, laughing so that he could scarce  sit his horse, leaving mine host still nailed to his door.
 Such is the  story of the hole which you have marked, and of the smudge upon the  wood.
 I have heard that from that time English archers have been better  treated in the auberge of Cardillac.
 But what have we here by the  wayside?"    "It appears to be a very holy man," said Alleyne.
    "And, by the rood! he hath some strange wares," cried John.
 "What are  these bits of stone, and of wood, and rusted nails, which are set out in  front of him?"    The man whom they had remarked sat with his back against a cherry-tree,  and his legs shooting out in front of him, like one who is greatly at  his ease.
 Across his thighs was a wooden board, and scattered over it  all manner of slips of wood and knobs of brick and stone, each laid  separate from the other, as a huckster places his wares.
 He was dressed  in a long gray gown, and wore a broad hat of the same color, much  weather-stained, with three scallop-shells dangling from the brim.
 As  they approached, the travellers observed that he was advanced in years,  and that his eyes were upturned and yellow.
    "Dear knights and gentlemen," he cried in a high crackling voice,  "worthy Christian cavaliers, will ye ride past and leave an aged pilgrim  to die of hunger? The sight hast been burned from mine eyes by the sands  of the Holy Land, and I have had neither crust of bread nor cup of wine  these two days past.
"    "By my hilt! father," said Aylward, looking keenly at him, "it is a  marvel to me that thy girdle should have so goodly a span and clip thee  so closely, if you have in sooth had so little to place within it.
"    "Kind stranger," answered the pilgrim, "you have unwittingly spoken  words which are very grievous to me to listen to.
 Yet I should be loth  to blame you, for I doubt not that what you said was not meant to sadden  me, nor to bring my sore affliction back to my mind.
 It ill becomes me  to prate too much of what I have endured for the faith, and yet, since  you have observed it, I must tell you that this thickness and roundness  of the waist is caused by a dropsy brought on by over-haste in  journeying from the house of Pilate to the Mount of Olives.
"    "There, Aylward," said Alleyne, with a reddened cheek, "let that curb  your blunt tongue.
 How could you bring a fresh pang to this holy man,  who hath endured so much and hath journeyed as far as Christ's own  blessed tomb?"    "May the foul fiend strike me dumb!" cried the bowman in hot repentance;  but both the palmer and Alleyne threw up their hands to stop him.
    "I forgive thee from my heart, dear brother," piped the blind man.
 "But,  oh, these wild words of thine are worse to mine ears than aught which  you could say of me.
"    "Not another word shall I speak," said Aylward; "but here is a franc for  thee and I crave thy blessing.
"    "And here is another," said Alleyne.
    "And another," cried Hordle John.
    But the blind palmer would have none of their alms.
 "Foolish, foolish  pride!" he cried, beating upon his chest with his large brown hand.
  "Foolish, foolish pride! How long then will it be ere I can scourge it  forth? Am I then never to conquer it? Oh, strong, strong are the ties of  flesh, and hard it is to subdue the spirit! I come, friends, of a noble  house, and I cannot bring myself to touch this money, even though it be  to save me from the grave.
"    "Alas! father," said Alleyne, "how then can we be of help to thee?"    "I had sat down here to die," quoth the palmer; "but for many years I  have carried in my wallet these precious things which you see set forth  now before me.
 It were sin, thought I, that my secret should perish with  me.
 I shall therefore sell these things to the first worthy passers-by,  and from them I shall have money enough to take me to the shrine of Our  Lady at Rocamadour, where I hope to lay these old bones.
"    "What are these treasures, then, father?" asked Hordle John.
 "I can but  see an old rusty nail, with bits of stone and slips of wood.
"    "My friend," answered the palmer, "not all the money that is in this  country could pay a just price for these wares of mine.
 This nail," he  continued, pulling off his hat and turning up his sightless orbs, "is  one of those wherewith man's salvation was secured.
 I had it, together  with this piece of the true rood, from the five-and-twentieth descendant  of Joseph of Arimathea, who still lives in Jerusalem alive and well,  though latterly much afflicted by boils.
 Aye, you may well cross  yourselves, and I beg that you will not breathe upon it or touch it with  your fingers.
"    "And the wood and stone, holy father?" asked Alleyne, with bated breath,  as he stared awe-struck at his precious relics.
    "This cantle of wood is from the true cross, this other from Noah his  ark, and the third is from the door-post of the temple of the wise King  Solomon.
 This stone was thrown at the sainted Stephen, and the other two  are from the Tower of Babel.
 Here, too, is part of Aaron's rod, and a  lock of hair from Elisha the prophet.
"    "But, father," quoth Alleyne, "the holy Elisha was bald, which brought  down upon him the revilements of the wicked children.
"    "It is very true that he had not much hair," said the palmer quickly,  "and it is this which makes this relic so exceeding precious.
 Take now  your choice of these, my worthy gentlemen, and pay such a price as  your consciences will suffer you to offer; for I am not a chapman nor  a huckster, and I would never part with them, did I not know that I am  very near to my reward.
"    "Aylward," said Alleyne excitedly, "this is such a chance as few folk  have twice in one life.
 The nail I must have, and I will give it to the  abbey of Beaulieu, so that all the folk in England may go thither to  wonder and to pray.
"    "And I will have the stone from the temple," cried Hordle John.
 "What  would not my old mother give to have it hung over her bed?"    "And I will have Aaron's rod," quoth Aylward.
 "I have but five florins  in the world, and here are four of them.
"    "Here are three more," said John.
    "And here are five more," added Alleyne.
 "Holy father, I hand you twelve  florins, which is all that we can give, though we well know how poor a  pay it is for the wondrous things which you sell us.
"    "Down, pride, down!" cried the pilgrim, still beating upon his chest.
  "Can I not bend myself then to take this sorry sum which is offered me  for that which has cost me the labors of a life.
 Give me the dross! Here  are the precious relics, and, oh, I pray you that you will handle them  softly and with reverence, else had I rather left my unworthy bones here  by the wayside.
"    With doffed caps and eager hands, the comrades took their new and  precious possessions, and pressed onwards upon their journey, leaving  the aged palmer still seated under the cherry-tree.
 They rode in  silence, each with his treasure in his hand, glancing at it from time to  time, and scarce able to believe that chance had made them sole owners  of relics of such holiness and worth that every abbey and church  in Christendom would have bid eagerly for their possession.
 So they  journeyed, full of this good fortune, until opposite the town of Le Mas,  where John's horse cast a shoe, and they were glad to find a wayside  smith who might set the matter to rights.
 To him Aylward narrated the  good hap which had befallen them; but the smith, when his eyes lit upon  the relics, leaned up against his anvil and laughed, with his hand to  his side, until the tears hopped down his sooty cheeks.
    "Why, masters," quoth he, "this man is a coquillart, or seller of false  relics, and was here in the smithy not two hours ago.
 This nail that  he hath sold you was taken from my nail-box, and as to the wood and the  stones, you will see a heap of both outside from which he hath filled  his scrip.
"    "Nay, nay," cried Alleyne, "this was a holy man who had journeyed to  Jerusalem, and acquired a dropsy by running from the house of Pilate to  the Mount of Olives.
"    "I know not about that," said the smith; "but I know that a man with a  gray palmer's hat and gown was here no very long time ago, and that he  sat on yonder stump and ate a cold pullet and drank a flask of wine.
  Then he begged from me one of my nails, and filling his scrip with  stones, he went upon his way.
 Look at these nails, and see if they are  not the same as that which he has sold you.
"    "Now may God save us!" cried Alleyne, all aghast.
 "Is there no end then  to the wickedness of humankind? He so humble, so aged, so loth to take  our money--and yet a villain and a cheat.
 Whom can we trust or believe  in?"    "I will after him," said Aylward, flinging himself into the saddle.
  "Come, Alleyne, we may catch him ere John's horse be shod.
"    Away they galloped together, and ere long they saw the old gray palmer  walking slowly along in front of them.
 He turned, however, at the sound  of their hoofs, and it was clear that his blindness was a cheat like all  the rest of him, for he ran swiftly through a field and so into a wood,  where none could follow him.
 They hurled their relics after him, and so  rode back to the blacksmith's the poorer both in pocket and in faith.
        .
 HOW ROGER CLUB-FOOT WAS PASSED INTO PARADISE.
      It was evening before the three comrades came into Aiguillon.
 There they  found Sir Nigel Loring and Ford safely lodged at the sign of the  "Baton Rouge," where they supped on good fare and slept between  lavender-scented sheets.
 It chanced, however, that a knight of Poitou,  Sir Gaston d'Estelle, was staying there on his way back from Lithuania,  where he had served a term with the Teutonic knights under the  land-master of the presbytery of Marienberg.
 He and Sir Nigel sat late  in high converse as to bushments, outfalls, and the intaking of cities,  with many tales of warlike men and valiant deeds.
 Then their talk turned  to minstrelsy, and the stranger knight drew forth a cittern, upon which  he played the minne-lieder of the north, singing the while in a high  cracked voice of Hildebrand and Brunhild and Siegfried, and all the  strength and beauty of the land of Almain.
 To this Sir Nigel answered  with the romances of Sir Eglamour, and of Sir Isumbras, and so through  the long winter night they sat by the crackling wood-fire answering each  other's songs until the crowing cocks joined in their concert.
 Yet, with  scarce an hour of rest, Sir Nigel was as blithe and bright as ever as  they set forth after breakfast upon their way.
    "This Sir Gaston is a very worthy man," said he to his squires as they  rode from the "Baton Rouge.
" "He hath a very strong desire to advance  himself, and would have entered upon some small knightly debate with me,  had he not chanced to have his arm-bone broken by the kick of a horse.
  I have conceived a great love for him, and I have promised him that when  his bone is mended I will exchange thrusts with him.
 But we must keep to  this road upon the left.
"    "Nay, my fair lord," quoth Aylward.
 "The road to Montaubon is over the  river, and so through Quercy and the Agenois.
"    "True, my good Aylward; but I have learned from this worthy knight, who  hath come over the French marches, that there is a company of Englishmen  who are burning and plundering in the country round Villefranche.
 I have  little doubt, from what he says, that they are those whom we seek.
"    "By my hilt! it is like enough," said Aylward.
 "By all accounts they had  been so long at Montaubon, that there would be little there worth the  taking.
 Then as they have already been in the south, they would come  north to the country of the Aveyron.
"    "We shall follow the Lot until we come to Cahors, and then cross the  marches into Villefranche," said Sir Nigel.
 "By St.
 Paul! as we are but  a small band, it is very likely that we may have some very honorable  and pleasing adventure, for I hear that there is little peace upon the  French border.
"    All morning they rode down a broad and winding road, barred with the  shadows of poplars.
 Sir Nigel rode in front with his squires, while the  two archers followed behind with the sumpter mule between them.
 They  had left Aiguillon and the Garonne far to the south, and rode now by  the tranquil Lot, which curves blue and placid through a gently rolling  country.
 Alleyne could not but mark that, whereas in Guienne there had  been many townlets and few castles, there were now many castles and few  houses.
 On either hand gray walls and square grim keeps peeped out at  every few miles from amid the forests while the few villages which  they passed were all ringed round with rude walls, which spoke of the  constant fear and sudden foray of a wild frontier land.
 Twice during the  morning there came bands of horsemen swooping down upon them from the  black gateways of wayside strongholds, with short, stern questions as to  whence they came and what their errand.
 Bands of armed men clanked  along the highway, and the few lines of laden mules which carried the  merchandise of the trader were guarded by armed varlets, or by archers  hired for the service.
    "The peace of Bretigny hath not made much change in these parts,"  quoth Sir Nigel, "for the country is overrun with free companions and  masterless men.
 Yonder towers, between the wood and the hill, mark the  town of Cahors, and beyond it is the land of France.
 But here is a man  by the wayside, and as he hath two horses and a squire I make little  doubt that he is a knight.
 I pray you, Alleyne, to give him greeting  from me, and to ask him for his titles and coat-armor.
 It may be that I  can relieve him of some vow, or perchance he hath a lady whom he would  wish to advance.
"    "Nay, my fair lord," said Alleyne, "these are not horses and a squire,  but mules and a varlet.
 The man is a mercer, for he hath a great bundle  beside him.
"    "Now, God's blessing on your honest English voice!" cried the stranger,  pricking up his ears at the sound of Alleyne's words.
 "Never have I  heard music that was so sweet to mine ear.
 Come, Watkin lad, throw the  bales over Laura's back! My heart was nigh broke, for it seemed that I  had left all that was English behind me, and that I would never set eyes  upon Norwich market square again.
" He was a tall, lusty, middle-aged  man with a ruddy face, a brown forked beard shot with gray, and a  broad Flanders hat set at the back of his head.
 His servant, as tall as  himself, but gaunt and raw-boned, had swung the bales on the back of  one mule, while the merchant mounted upon the other and rode to join  the party.
 It was easy to see, as he approached, from the quality of  his dress and the richness of his trappings, that he was a man of some  wealth and position.
    "Sir knight," said he, "my name is David Micheldene, and I am a burgher  and alderman of the good town of Norwich, where I live five doors from  the church of Our Lady, as all men know on the banks of Yare.
 I have  here my bales of cloth which I carry to Cahors--woe worth the day that  ever I started on such an errand! I crave your gracious protection upon  the way for me, my servant, and my mercery; for I have already had  many perilous passages, and have now learned that Roger Club-foot, the  robber-knight of Quercy, is out upon the road in front of me.
 I hereby  agree to give you one rose-noble if you bring me safe to the inn of the  'Angel' in Cahors, the same to be repaid to me or my heirs if any harm  come to me or my goods.
"    "By Saint Paul!" answered Sir Nigel, "I should be a sorry knight if I  ask pay for standing by a countryman in a strange land.
 You may ride  with me and welcome, Master Micheldene, and your varlet may follow with  my archers.
"    "God's benison upon thy bounty!" cried the stranger.
 "Should you come to  Norwich you may have cause to remember that you have been of service to  Alderman Micheldene.
 It is not very far to Cahors, for surely I see the  cathedral towers against the sky-line; but I have heard much of this  Roger Clubfoot, and the more I hear the less do I wish to look upon his  face.
 Oh, but I am sick and weary of it all, and I would give half that  I am worth to see my good dame sitting in peace beside me, and to hear  the bells of Norwich town.
"    "Your words are strange to me," quoth Sir Nigel, "for you have the  appearance of a stout man, and I see that you wear a sword by your  side.
"    "Yet it is not my trade," answered the merchant.
 "I doubt not that if  I set you down in my shop at Norwich you might scarce tell fustian from  falding, and know little difference between the velvet of Genoa and the  three-piled cloth of Bruges.
 There you might well turn to me for help.
  But here on a lone roadside, with thick woods and robber-knights, I turn  to you, for it is the business to which you have been reared.
"    "There is sooth in what you say, Master Micheldene," said Sir Nigel,  "and I trust that we may come upon this Roger Clubfoot, for I have heard  that he is a very stout and skilful soldier, and a man from whom much  honor is to be gained.
"    "He is a bloody robber," said the trader, curtly, "and I wish I saw him  kicking at the end of a halter.
"    "It is such men as he," Sir Nigel remarked, "who give the true knight  honorable deeds to do, whereby he may advance himself.
"    "It is such men as he," retorted Micheldene, "who are like rats in  a wheat-rick or moths in a woolfels, a harm and a hindrance to all  peaceful and honest men.
"    "Yet, if the dangers of the road weigh so heavily upon you, master  alderman, it is a great marvel to me that you should venture so far from  home.
"    "And sometimes, sir knight, it is a marvel to myself.
 But I am a man who  may grutch and grumble, but when I have set my face to do a thing I  will not turn my back upon it until it be done.
 There is one, Francois  Villet, at Cahors, who will send me wine-casks for my cloth-bales, so to  Cahors I will go, though all the robber-knights of Christendom were to  line the roads like yonder poplars.
"    "Stoutly spoken, master alderman! But how have you fared hitherto?"    "As a lamb fares in a land of wolves.
 Five times we have had to beg and  pray ere we could pass.
 Twice I have paid toll to the wardens of the  road.
 Three times we have had to draw, and once at La Reolle we stood  over our wool-bales, Watkin and I, and we laid about us for as long as a  man might chant a litany, slaying one rogue and wounding two others.
 By  God's coif! we are men of peace, but we are free English burghers, not  to be mishandled either in our country or abroad.
 Neither lord, baron,  knight, or commoner shall have as much as a strike of flax of mine  whilst I have strength to wag this sword.
"    "And a passing strange sword it is," quoth Sir Nigel.
 "What make you,  Alleyne, of these black lines which are drawn across the sheath?"    "I cannot tell what they are, my fair lord.
"    "Nor can I," said Ford.
    The merchant chuckled to himself.
 "It was a thought of mine own,"  said he; "for the sword was made by Thomas Wilson, the armorer, who is  betrothed to my second daughter Margery.
 Know then that the sheath is  one cloth-yard, in length, marked off according to feet and inches to  serve me as a measuring wand.
 It is also of the exact weight of two  pounds, so that I may use it in the balance.
"    "By Saint Paul!" quoth Sir Nigel, "it is very clear to me that the sword  is like thyself, good alderman, apt either for war or for peace.
 But  I doubt not that even in England you have had much to suffer from the  hands of robbers and outlaws.
"    "It was only last Lammastide, sir knight, that I was left for dead near  Reading as I journeyed to Winchester fair.
 Yet I had the rogues up at  the court of pie-powder, and they will harm no more peaceful traders.
"    "You travel much then!"    "To Winchester, Linn mart, Bristol fair, Stourbridge, and Bartholomew's  in London Town.
 The rest of the year you may ever find me five doors  from the church of Our Lady, where I would from my heart that I was at  this moment, for there is no air like Norwich air, and no water like the  Yare, nor can all the wines of France compare with the beer of old Sam  Yelverton who keeps the 'Dun Cow.
' But, out and alack, here is an evil  fruit which hangs upon this chestnut-tree!"    As he spoke they had ridden round a curve of the road and come upon a  great tree which shot one strong brown branch across their path.
 From  the centre of this branch there hung a man, with his head at a horrid  slant to his body and his toes just touching the ground.
 He was naked  save for a linen under shirt and pair of woollen drawers.
 Beside him  on a green bank there sat a small man with a solemn face, and a great  bundle of papers of all colors thrusting forth from the scrip which lay  beside him.
 He was very richly dressed, with furred robes, a scarlet  hood, and wide hanging sleeves lined with flame-colored silk.
 A great  gold chain hung round his neck, and rings glittered from every finger of  his hands.
 On his lap he had a little pile of gold and of silver, which  he was dropping, coin by coin, into a plump pouch which hung from his  girdle.
    "May the saints be with you, good travellers!" he shouted, as the  party rode up.
 "May the four Evangelists watch over you! May the twelve  Apostles bear you up! May the blessed army of martyrs direct your feet  and lead you to eternal bliss!"    "Gramercy for these good wishes!" said Sir Nigel.
 "But I perceive,  master alderman, that this man who hangs here is, by mark of foot, the  very robber-knight of whom we have spoken.
 But there is a cartel pinned  upon his breast, and I pray you, Alleyne, to read it to me.
"    The dead robber swung slowly to and fro in the wintry wind, a fixed  smile upon his swarthy face, and his bulging eyes still glaring down the  highway of which he had so long been the terror; on a sheet of parchment  upon his breast was printed in rude characters;                        ROGER PIED-BOT.
                  Par l'ordre du Senechal de                Castelnau, et de l'Echevin de                Cahors, servantes fideles du                tres vaillant et tres puissant                Edouard, Prince de Galles et                d'Aquitaine.
                Ne touchez pas,                Ne coutez pas,                Ne depechez pas.
    "He took a sorry time in dying," said the man who sat beside him.
 "He  could stretch one toe to the ground and bear himself up, so that I  thought he would never have done.
 Now at last, however, he is safely in  paradise, and so I may jog on upon my earthly way.
" He mounted, as he  spoke, a white mule which had been grazing by the wayside, all gay  with fustian of gold and silver bells, and rode onward with Sir Nigel's  party.
    "How know you then that he is in paradise?" asked Sir Nigel.
 "All things  are possible to God, but, certes, without a miracle, I should scarce  expect to find the soul of Roger Clubfoot amongst the just.
"    "I know that he is there because I have just passed him in there,"  answered the stranger, rubbing his bejewelled hands together in placid  satisfaction.
 "It is my holy mission to be a sompnour or pardoner.
 I am  the unworthy servant and delegate of him who holds the keys.
 A contrite  heart and ten nobles to holy mother Church may stave off perdition; but  he hath a pardon of the first degree, with a twenty-five livre benison,  so that I doubt if he will so much as feel a twinge of purgatory.
 I came  up even as the seneschal's archers were tying him up, and I gave him my  fore-word that I would bide with him until he had passed.
 There were two  leaden crowns among the silver, but I would not for that stand in the  way of his salvation.
"    "By Saint Paul!" said Sir Nigel, "if you have indeed this power to open  and to shut the gates of hope, then indeed you stand high above mankind.
  But if you do but claim to have it, and yet have it not, then it seems  to me, master clerk, that you may yourself find the gate barred when you  shall ask admittance.
"    "Small of faith! Small of faith!" cried the sompnour.
 "Ah, Sir Didymus  yet walks upon earth! And yet no words of doubt can bring anger to mine  heart, or a bitter word to my lip, for am I not a poor unworthy worker  in the cause of gentleness and peace? Of all these pardons which I bear  every one is stamped and signed by our holy father, the prop and centre  of Christendom.
"    "Which of them?" asked Sir Nigel.
    "Ha, ha!" cried the pardoner, shaking a jewelled forefinger.
 "Thou  wouldst be deep in the secrets of mother Church? Know then that I have  both in my scrip.
 Those who hold with Urban shall have Urban's pardon,  while I have Clement's for the Clementist--or he who is in doubt may  have both, so that come what may he shall be secure.
 I pray you that you  will buy one, for war is bloody work, and the end is sudden with little  time for thought or shrift.
 Or you, sir, for you seem to me to be a man  who would do ill to trust to your own merits.
" This to the alderman of  Norwich, who had listened to him with a frowning brow and a sneering  lip.
    "When I sell my cloth," quoth he, "he who buys may weigh and feel and  handle.
 These goods which you sell are not to be seen, nor is there  any proof that you hold them.
 Certes, if mortal man might control God's  mercy, it would be one of a lofty and God-like life, and not one who is  decked out with rings and chains and silks, like a pleasure-wench at a  kermesse.
    "Thou wicked and shameless man!" cried the clerk.
 "Dost thou dare to  raise thy voice against the unworthy servant of mother Church?"    "Unworthy enough!" quoth David Micheldene.
 "I would have you to know,  clerk, that I am a free English burgher, and that I dare say my mind to  our father the Pope himself, let alone such a lacquey's lacquey as you!"    "Base-born and foul-mouthed knave!" cried the sompnour.
 "You prate of  holy things, to which your hog's mind can never rise.
 Keep silence, lest  I call a curse upon you!"    "Silence yourself!" roared the other.
 "Foul bird! we found thee by the  gallows like a carrion-crow.
 A fine life thou hast of it with thy silks  and thy baubles, cozening the last few shillings from the pouches of  dying men.
 A fig for thy curse! Bide here, if you will take my rede, for  we will make England too hot for such as you, when Master Wicliff has  the ordering of it.
 Thou vile thief! it is you, and such as you, who  bring an evil name upon the many churchmen who lead a pure and a holy  life.
 Thou outside the door of heaven! Art more like to be inside the  door of hell.
"    At this crowning insult the sompnour, with a face ashen with rage,  raised up a quivering hand and began pouring Latin imprecations upon  the angry alderman.
 The latter, however, was not a man to be quelled by  words, for he caught up his ell-measure sword-sheath and belabored the  cursing clerk with it.
 The latter, unable to escape from the shower  of blows, set spurs to his mule and rode for his life, with his enemy  thundering behind him.
 At sight of his master's sudden departure, the  varlet Watkin set off after him, with the pack-mule beside him, so that  the four clattered away down the road together, until they swept round  a curve and their babble was but a drone in the distance.
 Sir Nigel  and Alleyne gazed in astonishment at one another, while Ford burst out  a-laughing.
    "Pardieu!" said the knight, "this David Micheldene must be one of those  Lollards about whom Father Christopher of the priory had so much to say.
  Yet he seemed to be no bad man from what I have seen of him.
"    "I have heard that Wicliff hath many followers in Norwich," answered  Alleyne.
    "By St.
 Paul! I have no great love for them," quoth Sir Nigel.
 "I am a  man who am slow to change; and, if you take away from me the faith that  I have been taught, it would be long ere I could learn one to set in its  place.
 It is but a chip here and a chip there, yet it may bring the tree  down in time.
 Yet, on the other hand, I cannot but think it shame that a  man should turn God's mercy on and off, as a cellarman doth wine with a  spigot.
"    "Nor is it," said Alleyne, "part of the teachings of that mother Church  of which he had so much to say.
 There was sooth in what the alderman  said of it.
"    "Then, by St.
 Paul! they may settle it betwixt them," quoth Sir Nigel.
  "For me, I serve God, the king and my lady; and so long as I can keep  the path of honor I am well content.
 My creed shall ever be that of  Chandos:            "Fais ce que dois--adviegne que peut,           C'est commande au chevalier.
"        .
 HOW THE COMRADES CAME OVER THE MARCHES OF FRANCE      After passing Cahors, the party branched away from the main road, and  leaving the river to the north of them, followed a smaller track which  wound over a vast and desolate plain.
 This path led them amid marshes  and woods, until it brought them out into a glade with a broad stream  swirling swiftly down the centre of it.
 Through this the horses splashed  their way, and on the farther shore Sir Nigel announced to them that  they were now within the borders of the land of France.
 For some miles  they still followed the same lonely track, which led them through  a dense wood, and then widening out, curved down to an open rolling  country, such as they had traversed between Aiguillon and Cahors.
    If it were grim and desolate upon the English border, however, what  can describe the hideous barrenness of this ten times harried tract  of France? The whole face of the country was scarred and disfigured,  mottled over with the black blotches of burned farm-steadings, and  the gray, gaunt gable-ends of what had been chateaux.
 Broken fences,  crumbling walls, vineyards littered with stones, the shattered arches of  bridges--look where you might, the signs of ruin and rapine met the eye.
  Here and there only, on the farthest sky-line, the gnarled turrets of a  castle, or the graceful pinnacles of church or of monastery showed where  the forces of the sword or of the spirit had preserved some small islet  of security in this universal flood of misery.
 Moodily and in silence  the little party rode along the narrow and irregular track, their hearts  weighed down by this far-stretching land of despair.
 It was indeed  a stricken and a blighted country, and a man might have ridden from  Auvergne in the north to the marches of Foix, nor ever seen a smiling  village or a thriving homestead.
    From time to time as they advanced they saw strange lean figures  scraping and scratching amid the weeds and thistles, who, on sight  of the band of horsemen, threw up their arms and dived in among the  brushwood, as shy and as swift as wild animals.
 More than once, however,  they came on families by the wayside, who were too weak from hunger and  disease to fly, so that they could but sit like hares on a tussock, with  panting chests and terror in their eyes.
 So gaunt were these poor folk,  so worn and spent--with bent and knotted frames, and sullen, hopeless,  mutinous faces--that it made the young Englishman heart-sick to look  upon them.
 Indeed, it seemed as though all hope and light had gone so  far from them that it was not to be brought back; for when Sir Nigel  threw down a handful of silver among them there came no softening of  their lined faces, but they clutched greedily at the coins, peering  questioningly at him, and champing with their animal jaws.
 Here and  there amid the brushwood the travellers saw the rude bundle of  sticks which served them as a home--more like a fowl's nest than the  dwelling-place of man.
 Yet why should they build and strive, when the  first adventurer who passed would set torch to their thatch, and when  their own feudal lord would wring from them with blows and curses the  last fruits of their toil? They sat at the lowest depth of human misery,  and hugged a bitter comfort to their souls as they realized that they  could go no lower.
 Yet they had still the human gift of speech, and  would take council among themselves in their brushwood hovels, glaring  with bleared eyes and pointing with thin fingers at the great widespread  chateaux which ate like a cancer into the life of the country-side.
 When  such men, who are beyond hope and fear, begin in their dim minds to see  the source of their woes, it may be an evil time for those who have wronged  them.
 The weak man becomes strong when he has nothing, for then only can  he feel the wild, mad thrill of despair.
 High and strong the chateaux,  lowly and weak the brushwood hut; but God help the seigneur and his lady  when the men of the brushwood set their hands to the work of revenge!    Through such country did the party ride for eight or it might be nine  miles, until the sun began to slope down in the west and their shadows  to stream down the road in front of them.
 Wary and careful they must  be, with watchful eyes to the right and the left, for this was no man's  land, and their only passports were those which hung from their belts.
  Frenchmen and Englishmen, Gascon and Provencal, Brabanter, Tardvenu,  Scorcher, Flayer, and Free Companion, wandered and struggled over the  whole of this accursed district.
 So bare and cheerless was the outlook,  and so few and poor the dwellings, that Sir Nigel began to have fears as  to whether he might find food and quarters for his little troop.
 It was  a relief to him, therefore, when their narrow track opened out upon a  larger road, and they saw some little way down it a square white house  with a great bunch of holly hung out at the end of a stick from one of  the upper windows.
    "By St.
 Paul!" said he, "I am right glad; for I had feared that we might  have neither provant nor herbergage.
 Ride on, Alleyne, and tell this  inn-keeper that an English knight with his party will lodge with him  this night.
"    Alleyne set spurs to his horse and reached the inn door a long bow-shot  before his companions.
 Neither varlet nor ostler could be seen, so he  pushed open the door and called loudly for the landlord.
 Three times he  shouted, but, receiving no reply, he opened an inner door and advanced  into the chief guest-room of the hostel.
    A very cheerful wood-fire was sputtering and cracking in an open grate  at the further end of the apartment.
 At one side of this fire, in a  high-backed oak chair, sat a lady, her face turned towards the door.
  The firelight played over her features, and Alleyne thought that he had  never seen such queenly power, such dignity and strength, upon a woman's  face.
 She might have been five-and-thirty years of age, with aquiline  nose, firm yet sensitive mouth, dark curving brows, and deep-set eyes  which shone and sparkled with a shifting brilliancy.
 Beautiful as she  was, it was not her beauty which impressed itself upon the beholder;  it was her strength, her power, the sense of wisdom which hung over  the broad white brow, the decision which lay in the square jaw and  delicately moulded chin.
 A chaplet of pearls sparkled amid her black  hair, with a gauze of silver network flowing back from it over her  shoulders; a black mantle was swathed round her, and she leaned back in  her chair as one who is fresh from a journey.
    In the opposite corner there sat a very burly and broad-shouldered man,  clad in a black jerkin trimmed with sable, with a black velvet cap with  curling white feather cocked upon the side of his head.
 A flask of red  wine stood at his elbow, and he seemed to be very much at his ease, for  his feet were stuck up on a stool, and between his thighs he held a dish  full of nuts.
 These he cracked between his strong white teeth and chewed  in a leisurely way, casting the shells into the blaze.
 As Alleyne gazed  in at him he turned his face half round and cocked an eye at him over  his shoulder.
 It seemed to the young Englishman that he had never seen  so hideous a face, for the eyes were of the lightest green, the nose was  broken and driven inwards, while the whole countenance was seared and  puckered with wounds.
 The voice, too, when he spoke, was as deep and as  fierce as the growl of a beast of prey.
    "Young man," said he, "I know not who you may be, and I am not much  inclined to bestir myself, but if it were not that I am bent upon taking  my ease, I swear, by the sword of Joshua! that I would lay my dog-whip  across your shoulders for daring to fill the air with these discordant  bellowings.
"    Taken aback at this ungentle speech, and scarce knowing how to answer it  fitly in the presence of the lady, Alleyne stood with his hand upon the  handle of the door, while Sir Nigel and his companions dismounted.
 At  the sound of these fresh voices, and of the tongue in which they spoke,  the stranger crashed his dish of nuts down upon the floor, and began  himself to call for the landlord until the whole house re-echoed with  his roarings.
 With an ashen face the white-aproned host came running  at his call, his hands shaking and his very hair bristling with  apprehension.
 "For the sake of God, sirs," he whispered as he passed,  "speak him fair and do not rouse him! For the love of the Virgin, be  mild with him!"    "Who is this, then?" asked Sir Nigel.
    Alleyne was about to explain, when a fresh roar from the stranger  interrupted him.
    "Thou villain inn-keeper," he shouted, "did I not ask you when I brought  my lady here whether your inn was clean?"    "You did, sire.
"    "Did I not very particularly ask you whether there were any vermin in  it?"    "You did, sire.
"    "And you answered me?"    "That there were not, sire.
"    "And yet ere I have been here an hour I find Englishmen crawling about  within it.
 Where are we to be free from this pestilent race? Can a  Frenchman upon French land not sit down in a French auberge without  having his ears pained by the clack of their hideous talk? Send them  packing, inn-keeper, or it may be the worse for them and for you.
"    "I will, sire, I will!" cried the frightened host, and bustled from  the room, while the soft, soothing voice of the woman was heard  remonstrating with her furious companion.
    "Indeed, gentlemen, you had best go," said mine host.
 "It is but six  miles to Villefranche, where there are very good quarters at the sign of  the 'Lion Rouge.
'"    "Nay," answered Sir Nigel, "I cannot go until I have seen more of this  person, for he appears to be a man from whom much is to be hoped.
 What  is his name and title?"    "It is not for my lips to name it unless by his desire.
 But I beg and  pray you, gentlemen, that you will go from my house, for I know not what  may come of it if his rage should gain the mastery of him.
"    "By Saint Paul!" lisped Sir Nigel, "this is certainly a man whom it  is worth journeying far to know.
 Go tell him that a humble knight of  England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any  presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and  the glory of our ladies.
 Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and  say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless  and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady  whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.
"    The landlord was hesitating whether to carry this message or no, when  the door of the inner room was flung open, and the stranger bounded out  like a panther from its den, his hair bristling and his deformed face  convulsed with anger.
    "Still here!" he snarled.
 "Dogs of England, must ye be lashed hence?  Tiphaine, my sword!" He turned to seize his weapon, but as he did so his  gaze fell upon the blazonry of sir Nigel's shield, and he stood staring,  while the fire in his strange green eyes softened into a sly and  humorous twinkle.
    "Mort Dieu!" cried he, "it is my little swordsman of Bordeaux.
 I should  remember that coat-armor, seeing that it is but three days since I  looked upon it in the lists by Garonne.
 Ah! Sir Nigel, Sir Nigel! you  owe me a return for this," and he touched his right arm, which was girt  round just under the shoulder with a silken kerchief.
    But the surprise of the stranger at the sight of Sir Nigel was as  nothing compared with the astonishment and the delight which shone upon  the face of the knight of Hampshire as he looked upon the strange face  of the Frenchman.
 Twice he opened his mouth and twice he peered again,  as though to assure himself that his eyes had not played him a trick.
    "Bertrand!" he gasped at last.
 "Bertrand du Guesclin!"    "By Saint Ives!" shouted the French soldier, with a hoarse roar of  laughter, "it is well that I should ride with my vizor down, for he that  has once seen my face does not need to be told my name.
 It is indeed I,  Sir Nigel, and here is my hand! I give you my word that there are but  three Englishmen in this world whom I would touch save with the sharp  edge of the sword: the prince is one, Chandos the second, and you the  third; for I have heard much that is good of you.
"    "I am growing aged, and am somewhat spent in the wars," quoth Sir Nigel;  "but I can lay by my sword now with an easy mind, for I can say that  I have crossed swords with him who hath the bravest heart and the  strongest arm of all this great kingdom of France.
 I have longed for it,  I have dreamed of it, and now I can scarce bring my mind to understand  that this great honor hath indeed been mine.
"    "By the Virgin of Rennes! you have given me cause to be very certain of  it," said Du Guesclin, with a gleam of his broad white teeth.
    "And perhaps, most honored sir, it would please you to continue the  debate.
 Perhaps you would condescend to go farther into the matter.
  God He knows that I am unworthy of such honor, yet I can show my  four-and-sixty quarterings, and I have been present at some bickerings  and scufflings during these twenty years.
"    "Your fame is very well known to me, and I shall ask my lady to enter  your name upon my tablets," said Sir Bertrand.
 "There are many who wish  to advance themselves, and who bide their turn, for I refuse no man who  comes on such an errand.
 At present it may not be, for mine arm is stiff  from this small touch, and I would fain do you full honor when we cross  swords again.
 Come in with me, and let your squires come also, that my  sweet spouse, the Lady Tiphaine, may say that she hath seen so famed and  gentle a knight.
"    Into the chamber they went in all peace and concord, where the Lady  Tiphaine sat like queen on throne for each in turn to be presented to  her.
 Sooth to say, the stout heart of Sir Nigel, which cared little for  the wrath of her lion-like spouse, was somewhat shaken by the calm, cold  face of this stately dame, for twenty years of camp-life had left him  more at ease in the lists than in a lady's boudoir.
 He bethought him,  too, as he looked at her set lips and deep-set questioning eyes, that he  had heard strange tales of this same Lady Tiphaine du Guesclin.
 Was  it not she who was said to lay hands upon the sick and raise them from  their couches when the leeches had spent their last nostrums? Had she  not forecast the future, and were there not times when in the loneliness  of her chamber she was heard to hold converse with some being upon whom  mortal eye never rested--some dark familiar who passed where doors were  barred and windows high? Sir Nigel sunk his eye and marked a cross on  the side of his leg as he greeted this dangerous dame, and yet ere  five minutes had passed he was hers, and not he only but his two young  squires as well.
 The mind had gone out of them, and they could but look  at this woman and listen to the words which fell from her lips--words  which thrilled through their nerves and stirred their souls like the  battle-call of a bugle.
    Often in peaceful after-days was Alleyne to think of that scene of the  wayside inn of Auvergne.
 The shadows of evening had fallen, and the  corners of the long, low, wood-panelled room were draped in darkness.
  The sputtering wood fire threw out a circle of red flickering light  which played over the little group of wayfarers, and showed up every  line and shadow upon their faces.
 Sir Nigel sat with elbows upon knees,  and chin upon hands, his patch still covering one eye, but his other  shining like a star, while the ruddy light gleamed upon his smooth white  head.
 Ford was seated at his left, his lips parted, his eyes staring,  and a fleck of deep color on either cheek, his limbs all rigid as one  who fears to move.
 On the other side the famous French captain leaned  back in his chair, a litter of nut-shells upon his lap, his huge head  half buried in a cushion, while his eyes wandered with an amused gleam  from his dame to the staring, enraptured Englishmen.
 Then, last of  all, that pale clear-cut face, that sweet clear voice, with its high  thrilling talk of the deathlessness of glory, of the worthlessness of  life, of the pain of ignoble joys, and of the joy which lies in all  pains which lead to a noble end.
 Still, as the shadows deepened, she  spoke of valor and virtue, of loyalty, honor, and fame, and still they  sat drinking in her words while the fire burned down and the red ash  turned to gray.
    "By the sainted Ives!" cried Du Guesclin at last, "it is time that we  spoke of what we are to do this night, for I cannot think that in this  wayside auberge there are fit quarters for an honorable company.
"    Sir Nigel gave a long sigh as he came back from the dreams of chivalry  and hardihood into which this strange woman's words had wafted him.
 "I  care not where I sleep," said he; "but these are indeed somewhat rude  lodgings for this fair lady.
"    "What contents my lord contents me," quoth she.
 "I perceive, Sir Nigel,  that you are under vow," she added, glancing at his covered eye.
    "It is my purpose to attempt some small deed," he answered.
    "And the glove--is it your lady's?"    "It is indeed my sweet wife's.
"    "Who is doubtless proud of you.
"    "Say rather I of her," quoth he quickly.
 "God He knows that I am not  worthy to be her humble servant.
 It is easy, lady, for a man to ride  forth in the light of day, and do his devoir when all men have eyes for  him.
 But in a woman's heart there is a strength and truth which asks no  praise, and can but be known to him whose treasure it is.
"    The Lady Tiphaine smiled across at her husband.
 "You have often told  me, Bertrand, that there were very gentle knights amongst the English,"  quoth she.
    "Aye, aye," said he moodily.
 "But to horse, Sir Nigel, you and yours  and we shall seek the chateau of Sir Tristram de Rochefort, which is  two miles on this side of Villefranche.
 He is Seneschal of Auvergne, and  mine old war companion.
"    "Certes, he would have a welcome for you," quoth Sir Nigel; "but indeed  he might look askance at one who comes without permit over the marches.
"    "By the Virgin! when he learns that you have come to draw away these  rascals he will be very blithe to look upon your face.
 Inn-keeper, here  are ten gold pieces.
 What is over and above your reckoning you may take  off from your charges to the next needy knight who comes this way.
 Come  then, for it grows late and the horses are stamping in the roadway.
"    The Lady Tiphaine and her spouse sprang upon their steeds without  setting feet to stirrup, and away they jingled down the white moonlit  highway, with Sir Nigel at the lady's bridle-arm, and Ford a spear's  length behind them.
 Alleyne had lingered for an instant in the passage,  and as he did so there came a wild outcry from a chamber upon the  left, and out there ran Aylward and John, laughing together like two  schoolboys who are bent upon a prank.
 At sight of Alleyne they slunk  past him with somewhat of a shame-faced air, and springing upon their  horses galloped after their party.
 The hubbub within the chamber did not  cease, however, but rather increased, with yells of: "A moi, mes amis! A  moi, camarades! A moi, l'honorable champion de l'Eveque de Montaubon! A  la recousse de l'eglise sainte!" So shrill was the outcry that both the  inn-keeper and Alleyne, with every varlet within hearing, rushed wildly  to the scene of the uproar.
    It was indeed a singular scene which met their eyes.
 The room was a long  and lofty one, stone floored and bare, with a fire at the further end  upon which a great pot was boiling.
 A deal table ran down the centre,  with a wooden wine-pitcher upon it and two horn cups.
 Some way from it  was a smaller table with a single beaker and a broken wine-bottle.
 From  the heavy wooden rafters which formed the roof there hung rows of hooks  which held up sides of bacon, joints of smoked beef, and strings of  onions for winter use.
 In the very centre of all these, upon the  largest hook of all, there hung a fat little red-faced man with enormous  whiskers, kicking madly in the air and clawing at rafters, hams, and  all else that was within hand-grasp.
 The huge steel hook had been passed  through the collar of his leather jerkin, and there he hung like a fish  on a line, writhing, twisting, and screaming, but utterly unable to free  himself from his extraordinary position.
 It was not until Alleyne and  the landlord had mounted on the table that they were able to lift him  down, when he sank gasping with rage into a seat, and rolled his eyes  round in every direction.
    "Has he gone?" quoth he.
    "Gone? Who?"    "He, the man with the red head, the giant man.
"    "Yes," said Alleyne, "he hath gone.
"    "And comes not back?"    "No.
"    "The better for him!" cried the little man, with a long sigh of relief.
  "Mon Dieu! What! am I not the champion of the Bishop of Montaubon? Ah,  could I have descended, could I have come down, ere he fled! Then you  would have seen.
 You would have beheld a spectacle then.
 There would  have been one rascal the less upon earth.
 Ma foi, yes!"    "Good master Pelligny," said the landlord, "these gentlemen have not  gone very fast, and I have a horse in the stable at your disposal, for  I would rather have such bloody doings as you threaten outside the four  walls of mine auberge.
"    "I hurt my leg and cannot ride," quoth the bishop's champion.
 "I  strained a sinew on the day that I slew the three men at Castelnau.
"    "God save you, master Pelligny!" cried the landlord.
 "It must be an  awesome thing to have so much blood upon one's soul.
 And yet I do not  wish to see so valiant a man mishandled, and so I will, for friendship's  sake, ride after this Englishman and bring him back to you.
"    "You shall not stir," cried the champion, seizing the inn-keeper in a  convulsive grasp.
 "I have a love for you, Gaston, and I would not  bring your house into ill repute, nor do such scath to these walls and  chattels as must befall if two such men as this Englishman and I fall to  work here.
"    "Nay, think not of me!" cried the inn-keeper.
 "What are my walls when  set against the honor of Francois Poursuivant d'Amour Pelligny, champion  of the Bishop of Montaubon.
 My horse, Andre!"    "By the saints, no! Gaston, I will not have it! You have said truly that  it is an awesome thing to have such rough work upon one's soul.
 I am  but a rude soldier, yet I have a mind.
 Mon Dieu! I reflect, I weigh, I  balance.
 Shall I not meet this man again? Shall I not bear him in mind?  Shall I not know him by his great paws and his red head? Ma foi, yes!"    "And may I ask, sir," said Alleyne, "why it is that you call yourself  champion of the Bishop of Montaubon?"    "You may ask aught which it is becoming to me to answer.
 The bishop hath  need of a champion, because, if any cause be set to test of combat, it  would scarce become his office to go down into the lists with leather  and shield and cudgel to exchange blows with any varlet.
 He looks around  him then for some tried fighting man, some honest smiter who can give a  blow or take one.
 It is not for me to say how far he hath succeeded, but  it is sooth that he who thinks that he hath but to do with the Bishop of  Montaubon, finds himself face to face with Francois Poursuivant d'Amour  Pelligny.
"    At this moment there was a clatter of hoofs upon the road, and a varlet  by the door cried out that one of the Englishmen was coming back.
  The champion looked wildly about for some corner of safety, and was  clambering up towards the window, when Ford's voice sounded from  without, calling upon Alleyne to hasten, or he might scarce find his  way.
 Bidding adieu to landlord and to champion, therefore, he set off at  a gallop, and soon overtook the two archers.
    "A pretty thing this, John," said he.
 "Thou wilt have holy Church upon  you if you hang her champions upon iron hooks in an inn kitchen.
"    "It was done without thinking," he answered apologetically, while  Aylward burst into a shout of laughter.
    "By my hilt! mon petit," said he, "you would have laughed also could  you have seen it.
 For this man was so swollen with pride that he would  neither drink with us, nor sit at the same table with us, nor as much as  answer a question, but must needs talk to the varlet all the time that  it was well there was peace, and that he had slain more Englishmen than  there were tags to his doublet.
 Our good old John could scarce lay his  tongue to French enough to answer him, so he must needs reach out his  great hand to him and place him very gently where you saw him.
 But we  must on, for I can scarce hear their hoofs upon the road.
"    "I think that I can see them yet," said Ford, peering down the moonlit  road.
    "Pardieu! yes.
 Now they ride forth from the shadow.
 And yonder dark  clump is the Castle of Villefranche.
 En avant camarades! or Sir Nigel  may reach the gates before us.
 But hark, mes amis, what sound is that?"    As he spoke the hoarse blast of a horn was heard from some woods upon  the right.
 An answering call rung forth upon their left, and hard upon  it two others from behind them.
    "They are the horns of swine-herds," quoth Aylward.
 "Though why they  blow them so late I cannot tell.
"    "Let us on, then," said Ford, and the whole party, setting their spurs  to their horses, soon found themselves at the Castle of Villefranche,  where the drawbridge had already been lowered and the portcullis raised  in response to the summons of Du Guesclin.
        .
 HOW THE BLESSED HOUR OF SIGHT CAME TO THE LADY TIPHAINE.
      Sir Tristram de Rochefort, Seneschal of Auvergne and Lord of  Villefranche, was a fierce and renowned soldier who had grown gray in  the English wars.
 As lord of the marches and guardian of an exposed  country-side, there was little rest for him even in times of so-called  peace, and his whole life was spent in raids and outfalls upon the  Brabanters, late-comers, flayers, free companions, and roving archers  who wandered over his province.
 At times he would come back in triumph,  and a dozen corpses swinging from the summit of his keep would warn  evil-doers that there was still a law in the land.
 At others his  ventures were not so happy, and he and his troop would spur it over  the drawbridge with clatter of hoofs hard at their heels and whistle of  arrows about their ears.
 Hard he was of hand and harder of heart, hated  by his foes, and yet not loved by those whom he protected, for twice he  had been taken prisoner, and twice his ransom had been wrung by dint  of blows and tortures out of the starving peasants and ruined farmers.
  Wolves or watch-dogs, it was hard to say from which the sheep had most  to fear.
    The Castle of Villefranche was harsh and stern as its master.
 A broad  moat, a high outer wall turreted at the corners, with a great black keep  towering above all--so it lay before them in the moonlight.
 By the light  of two flambeaux, protruded through the narrow slit-shaped openings at  either side of the ponderous gate, they caught a glimpse of the glitter  of fierce eyes and of the gleam of the weapons of the guard.
 The sight  of the two-headed eagle of Du Guesclin, however, was a passport into  any fortalice in France, and ere they had passed the gate the old border  knight came running forwards with hands out-thrown to greet his famous  countryman.
 Nor was he less glad to see Sir Nigel, when the Englishman's  errand was explained to him, for these archers had been a sore thorn in  his side and had routed two expeditions which he had sent against them.
  A happy day it would be for the Seneschal of Auvergne when they should  learn that the last yew bow was over the marches.
    The material for a feast was ever at hand in days when, if there was  grim want in the cottage, there was at least rude plenty in the castle.
  Within an hour the guests were seated around a board which creaked under  the great pasties and joints of meat, varied by those more dainty  dishes in which the French excelled, the spiced ortolan and the truffled  beccaficoes.
 The Lady Rochefort, a bright and laughter-loving dame, sat  upon the left of her warlike spouse, with Lady Tiphaine upon the right.
  Beneath sat Du Guesclin and Sir Nigel, with Sir Amory Monticourt, of the  order of the Hospitallers, and Sir Otto Harnit, a wandering knight  from the kingdom of Bohemia.
 These with Alleyne and Ford, four French  squires, and the castle chaplain, made the company who sat together that  night and made good cheer in the Castle of Villefranche.
 The great fire  crackled in the grate, the hooded hawks slept upon their perches, the  rough deer-hounds with expectant eyes crouched upon the tiled floor;  close at the elbows of the guests stood the dapper little lilac-coated  pages; the laugh and jest circled round and all was harmony and comfort.
  Little they recked of the brushwood men who crouched in their rags along  the fringe of the forest and looked with wild and haggard eyes at the  rich, warm glow which shot a golden bar of light from the high arched  windows of the castle.
    Supper over, the tables dormant were cleared away as by magic and  trestles and bancals arranged around the blazing fire, for there was a  bitter nip in the air.
 The Lady Tiphaine had sunk back in her cushioned  chair, and her long dark lashes drooped low over her sparkling eyes.
  Alleyne, glancing at her, noted that her breath came quick and short,  and that her cheeks had blanched to a lily white.
 Du Guesclin eyed her  keenly from time to time, and passed his broad brown fingers through his  crisp, curly black hair with the air of a man who is perplexed in his  mind.
    "These folk here," said the knight of Bohemia, "they do not seem too  well fed.
"    "Ah, canaille!" cried the Lord of Villefranche.
 "You would scarce credit  it, and yet it is sooth that when I was taken at Poictiers it was all  that my wife and foster-brother could do to raise the money from them  for my ransom.
 The sulky dogs would rather have three twists of a rack,  or the thumbikins for an hour, than pay out a denier for their own  feudal father and liege lord.
 Yet there is not one of them but hath an  old stocking full of gold pieces hid away in a snug corner.
"    "Why do they not buy food then?" asked Sir Nigel.
 "By St.
 Paul! it  seemed to me their bones were breaking through their skin.
"    "It is their grutching and grumbling which makes them thin.
 We have a  saying here, Sir Nigel, that if you pummel Jacques Bonhomme he will pat  you, but if you pat him he will pummel you.
 Doubtless you find it so in  England.
"    "Ma foi, no!" said Sir Nigel.
 "I have two Englishmen of this class in  my train, who are at this instant, I make little doubt, as full of your  wine as any cask in your cellar.
 He who pummelled them might come by  such a pat as he would be likely to remember.
"    "I cannot understand it," quoth the seneschal, "for the English knights  and nobles whom I have met were not men to brook the insolence of the  base born.
"    "Perchance, my fair lord, the poor folk are sweeter and of a better  countenance in England," laughed the Lady Rochefort.
 "Mon Dieu! you  cannot conceive to yourself how ugly they are! Without hair, without  teeth, all twisted and bent; for me, I cannot think how the good God  ever came to make such people.
 I cannot bear it, I, and so my trusty  Raoul goes ever before me with a cudgel to drive them from my path.
"    "Yet they have souls, fair lady, they have souls!" murmured the  chaplain, a white-haired man with a weary, patient face.
    "So I have heard you tell them," said the lord of the castle; "and for  myself, father, though I am a true son of holy Church, yet I think  that you were better employed in saying your mass and in teaching the  children of my men-at-arms, than in going over the country-side to put  ideas in these folks' heads which would never have been there but for  you.
 I have heard that you have said to them that their souls are as  good as ours, and that it is likely that in another life they may stand  as high as the oldest blood of Auvergne.
 For my part, I believe that  there are so many worthy knights and gallant gentlemen in heaven who  know how such things should be arranged, that there is little fear that  we shall find ourselves mixed up with base roturiers and swine-herds.
  Tell your beads, father, and con your psalter, but do not come between  me and those whom the king has given to me!"    "God help them!" cried the old priest.
 "A higher King than yours has  given them to me, and I tell you here in your own castle hall, Sir  Tristram de Rochefort, that you have sinned deeply in your dealings with  these poor folk, and that the hour will come, and may even now be at  hand, when God's hand will be heavy upon you for what you have done.
" He  rose as he spoke, and walked slowly from the room.
    "Pest take him!" cried the French knight.
 "Now, what is a man to do with  a priest, Sir Bertrand?--for one can neither fight him like a man nor  coax him like a woman.
"    "Ah, Sir Bertrand knows, the naughty one!" cried the Lady Rochefort.
  "Have we not all heard how he went to Avignon and squeezed fifty  thousand crowns out of the Pope.
"    "Ma foi!" said Sir Nigel, looking with a mixture of horror and  admiration at Du Guesclin.
 "Did not your heart sink within you? Were you  not smitten with fears? Have you not felt a curse hang over you?"    "I have not observed it," said the Frenchman carelessly.
 "But by Saint  Ives! Tristram, this chaplain of yours seems to me to be a worthy man,  and you should give heed to his words, for though I care nothing for  the curse of a bad pope, it would be a grief to me to have aught but a  blessing from a good priest.
"    "Hark to that, my fair lord," cried the Lady Rochefort.
 "Take heed, I  pray thee, for I do not wish to have a blight cast over me, nor a palsy  of the limbs.
 I remember that once before you angered Father Stephen,  and my tire-woman said that I lost more hair in seven days than ever  before in a month.
"    "If that be sign of sin, then, by Saint Paul! I have much upon my soul,"  said Sir Nigel, amid a general laugh.
 "But in very truth, Sir Tristram,  if I may venture a word of counsel, I should advise that you make your  peace with this good man.
"    "He shall have four silver candlesticks," said the seneschal moodily.
  "And yet I would that he would leave the folk alone.
 You cannot conceive  in your mind how stubborn and brainless they are.
 Mules and pigs are  full of reason beside them.
 God He knows that I have had great patience  with them.
 It was but last week that, having to raise some money,  I called up to the castle Jean Goubert, who, as all men know, has a  casketful of gold pieces hidden away in some hollow tree.
 I give you my  word that I did not so much as lay a stripe upon his fool's back, but  after speaking with him, and telling him how needful the money was to  me, I left him for the night to think over the matter in my dungeon.
  What think you that the dog did? Why, in the morning we found that he  had made a rope from strips of his leathern jerkin, and had hung himself  to the bar of the window.
"    "For me, I cannot conceive such wickedness!" cried the lady.
    "And there was Gertrude Le Boeuf, as fair a maiden as eye could see, but  as bad and bitter as the rest of them.
 When young Amory de Valance was  here last Lammastide he looked kindly upon the girl, and even spoke of  taking her into his service.
 What does she do, with her dog of a father?  Why, they tie themselves together and leap into the Linden Pool, where  the water is five spears'-lengths deep.
 I give you my word that it was  a great grief to young Amory, and it was days ere he could cast it  from his mind.
 But how can one serve people who are so foolish and so  ungrateful?"    Whilst the Seneschal of Villefranche had been detailing the evil doings  of his tenants, Alleyne had been unable to take his eyes from the face  of Lady Tiphaine.
 She had lain back in her chair, with drooping eyelids  and bloodless face, so that he had feared at first her journey had  weighed heavily upon her, and that the strength was ebbing out of her.
  Of a sudden, however, there came a change, for a dash of bright color  flickered up on to either cheek, and her lids were slowly raised again  upon eyes which sparkled with such lustre as Alleyne had never seen  in human eyes before, while their gaze was fixed intently, not on the  company, but on the dark tapestry which draped the wall.
 So transformed  and so ethereal was her expression, that Alleyne, in his loftiest dream  of archangel or of seraph, had never pictured so sweet, so womanly, and  yet so wise a face.
 Glancing at Du Guesclin, Alleyne saw that he also  was watching his wife closely, and from the twitching of his features,  and the beads upon his brick-colored brow, it was easy to see that he  was deeply agitated by the change which he marked in her.
    "How is it with you, lady?" he asked at last, in a tremulous voice.
    Her eyes remained fixed intently upon the wall, and there was a long  pause ere she answered him.
 Her voice, too, which had been so clear  and ringing, was now low and muffled as that of one who speaks from a  distance.
    "All is very well with me, Bertrand," said she.
 "The blessed hour of  sight has come round to me again.
"    "I could see it come! I could see it come!" he exclaimed, passing his  fingers through his hair with the same perplexed expression as before.
    "This is untoward, Sir Tristram," he said at last.
 "And I scarce know  in what words to make it clear to you, and to your fair wife, and to Sir  Nigel Loring, and to these other stranger knights.
 My tongue is a blunt  one, and fitter to shout word of command than to clear up such a matter  as this, of which I can myself understand little.
 This, however, I know,  that my wife is come of a very sainted race, whom God hath in His  wisdom endowed with wondrous powers, so that Tiphaine Raquenel was known  throughout Brittany ere ever I first saw her at Dinan.
 Yet these powers  are ever used for good, and they are the gift of God and not of the  devil, which is the difference betwixt white magic and black.
"    "Perchance it would be as well that we should send for Father Stephen,"  said Sir Tristram.
    "It would be best that he should come," cried the Hospitaller.
    "And bring with him a flask of holy water," added the knight of Bohemia.
    "Not so, gentlemen," answered Sir Bertrand.
 "It is not needful that this  priest should be called, and it is in my mind that in asking for this ye  cast some slight shadow or slur upon the good name of my wife, as though  it were still doubtful whether her power came to her from above or  below.
 If ye have indeed such a doubt I pray that you will say so, that  we may discuss the matter in a fitting way.
"    "For myself," said Sir Nigel, "I have heard such words fall from the  lips of this lady that I am of the opinion that there is no woman,  save only one, who can be in any way compared to her in beauty and in  goodness.
 Should any gentleman think otherwise, I should deem it great  honor to run a small course with him, or debate the matter in whatever  way might be most pleasing to him.
"    "Nay, it would ill become me to cast a slur upon a lady who is both  my guest and the wife of my comrade-in-arms," said the Seneschal of  Villefranche.
 "I have perceived also that on her mantle there is marked  a silver cross, which is surely sign enough that there is nought of evil  in these strange powers which you say that she possesses.
"    This argument of the seneschal's appealed so powerfully to the Bohemian  and to the Hospitaller that they at once intimated that their objections  had been entirely overcome, while even the Lady Rochefort, who had sat  shivering and crossing herself, ceased to cast glances at the door, and  allowed her fears to turn to curiosity.
    "Among the gifts which have been vouchsafed to my wife," said Du  Guesclin, "there is the wondrous one of seeing into the future; but it  comes very seldom upon her, and goes as quickly, for none can command  it.
 The blessed hour of sight, as she hath named it, has come but twice  since I have known her, and I can vouch for it that all that she hath  told me was true, for on the evening of the Battle of Auray she said  that the morrow would be an ill day for me and for Charles of Blois.
  Ere the sun had sunk again he was dead, and I the prisoner of Sir John  Chandos.
 Yet it is not every question that she can answer, but only  those----"    "Bertrand, Bertrand!" cried the lady in the same muttering far-away  voice, "the blessed hour passes.
 Use it, Bertrand, while you may.
"    "I will, my sweet.
 Tell me, then, what fortune comes upon me?"    "Danger, Bertrand--deadly, pressing danger--which creeps upon you and  you know it not.
"    The French soldier burst into a thunderous laugh, and his green eyes  twinkled with amusement.
 "At what time during these twenty years would  not that have been a true word?" he cried.
 "Danger is in the air that I  breathe.
 But is this so very close, Tiphaine?"    "Here--now--close upon you!" The words came out in broken, strenuous  speech, while the lady's fair face was writhed and drawn like that of  one who looks upon a horror which strikes the words from her lips.
 Du  Guesclin gazed round the tapestried room, at the screens, the tables,  the abace, the credence, the buffet with its silver salver, and the  half-circle of friendly, wondering faces.
 There was an utter stillness,  save for the sharp breathing of the Lady Tiphaine and for the gentle  soughing of the wind outside, which wafted to their ears the distant  call upon a swine-herd's horn.
    "The danger may bide," said he, shrugging his broad shoulders.
 "And now,  Tiphaine, tell us what will come of this war in Spain.
"    "I can see little," she answered, straining her eyes and puckering her  brow, as one who would fain clear her sight.
 "There are mountains, and  dry plains, and flash of arms and shouting of battle-cries.
 Yet it is  whispered to me that by failure you will succeed.
"    "Ha! Sir Nigel, how like you that?" quoth Bertrand, shaking his head.
  "It is like mead and vinegar, half sweet, half sour.
 And is there no  question which you would ask my lady?"    "Certes there is.
 I would fain know, fair lady, how all things are at  Twynham Castle, and above all how my sweet lady employs herself.
"    "To answer this I would fain lay hand upon one whose thoughts turn  strongly to this castle which you have named.
 Nay, my Lord Loring, it is  whispered to me that there is another here who hath thought more deeply  of it than you.
"    "Thought more of mine own home?" cried Sir Nigel.
 "Lady, I fear that in  this matter at least you are mistaken.
"    "Not so, Sir Nigel.
 Come hither, young man, young English squire with  the gray eyes! Now give me your hand, and place it here across my brow,  that I may see that which you have seen.
 What is this that rises before  me? Mist, mist, rolling mist with a square black tower above it.
 See it  shreds out, it thins, it rises, and there lies a castle in green plain,  with the sea beneath it, and a great church within a bow-shot.
 There are  two rivers which run through the meadows, and between them lie the tents  of the besiegers.
"    "The besiegers!" cried Alleyne, Ford, and Sir Nigel, all three in a  breath.
    "Yes, truly, and they press hard upon the castle, for they are an  exceeding multitude and full of courage.
 See how they storm and rage  against the gate, while some rear ladders, and others, line after line,  sweep the walls with their arrows.
 There are many leaders who shout and  beckon, and one, a tall man with a golden beard, who stands before the  gate stamping his foot and hallooing them on, as a pricker doth the  hounds.
 But those in the castle fight bravely.
 There is a woman, two  women, who stand upon the walls, and give heart to the men-at-arms.
 They  shower down arrows, darts and great stones.
 Ah! they have struck down  the tall leader, and the others give back.
 The mist thickens and I can  see no more.
"    "By Saint Paul!" said Sir Nigel, "I do not think that there can be any  such doings at Christchurch, and I am very easy of the fortalice so long  as my sweet wife hangs the key of the outer bailey at the head of her  bed.
 Yet I will not deny that you have pictured the castle as well as I  could have done myself, and I am full of wonderment at all that I have  heard and seen.
"    "I would, Lady Tiphaine," cried the Lady Rochefort, "that you would use  your power to tell me what hath befallen my golden bracelet which I wore  when hawking upon the second Sunday of Advent, and have never set eyes  upon since.
"    "Nay, lady," said du Guesclin, "it does not befit so great and wondrous  a power to pry and search and play the varlet even to the beautiful  chatelaine of Villefranche.
 Ask a worthy question, and, with the  blessing of God, you shall have a worthy answer.
"    "Then I would fain ask," cried one of the French squires, "as to which  may hope to conquer in these wars betwixt the English and ourselves.
"    "Both will conquer and each will hold its own," answered the Lady  Tiphaine.
    "Then we shall still hold Gascony and Guienne?" cried Sir Nigel.
    The lady shook her head.
 "French land, French blood, French speech," she  answered.
 "They are French, and France shall have them.
"    "But not Bordeaux?" cried Sir Nigel excitedly.
    "Bordeaux also is for France.
"    "But Calais?"    "Calais too.
"    "Woe worth me then, and ill hail to these evil words! If Bordeaux and  Calais be gone, then what is left for England?"    "It seems indeed that there are evil times coming upon your country,"  said Du Guesclin.
 "In our fondest hopes we never thought to hold  Bordeaux.
 By Saint Ives! this news hath warmed the heart within me.
 Our  dear country will then be very great in the future, Tiphaine?"    "Great, and rich, and beautiful," she cried.
 "Far down the course of  time I can see her still leading the nations, a wayward queen among the  peoples, great in war, but greater in peace, quick in thought, deft in  action, with her people's will for her sole monarch, from the sands of  Calais to the blue seas of the south.
"    "Ha!" cried Du Guesclin, with his eyes flashing in triumph, "you hear  her, Sir Nigel?--and she never yet said word which was not sooth.
"    The English knight shook his head moodily.
 "What of my own poor  country?" said he.
 "I fear, lady, that what you have said bodes but  small good for her.
"    The lady sat with parted lips, and her breath came quick and fast.
 "My  God!" she cried, "what is this that is shown me? Whence come they, these  peoples, these lordly nations, these mighty countries which rise up  before me? I look beyond, and others rise, and yet others, far and  farther to the shores of the uttermost waters.
 They crowd! They swarm!  The world is given to them, and it resounds with the clang of their  hammers and the ringing of their church bells.
 They call them many  names, and they rule them this way or that but they are all English,  for I can hear the voices of the people.
 On I go, and onwards over seas  where man hath never yet sailed, and I see a great land under new  stars and a stranger sky, and still the land is England.
 Where have her  children not gone? What have they not done? Her banner is planted on  ice.
 Her banner is scorched in the sun.
 She lies athwart the lands, and  her shadow is over the seas.
 Bertrand, Bertrand! we are undone for the  buds of her bud are even as our choicest flower!" Her voice rose into  a wild cry, and throwing up her arms she sank back white and nerveless  into the deep oaken chair.
    "It is over," said Du Guesclin moodily, as he raised her drooping head  with his strong brown hand.
 "Wine for the lady, squire! The blessed hour  of sight hath passed.
"        .
 HOW THE BRUSHWOOD MEN CAME TO THE CHATEAU OF VILLEFRANCHE.
      It was late ere Alleyne Edricson, having carried Sir Nigel the goblet  of spiced wine which it was his custom to drink after the curling of his  hair, was able at last to seek his chamber.
 It was a stone-flagged room  upon the second floor, with a bed in a recess for him, and two smaller  pallets on the other side, on which Aylward and Hordle John were already  snoring.
 Alleyne had knelt down to his evening orisons, when there came  a tap at his door, and Ford entered with a small lamp in his hand.
 His  face was deadly pale, and his hand shook until the shadows flickered up  and down the wall.
    "What is it, Ford?" cried Alleyne, springing to his feet.
    "I can scarce tell you," said he, sitting down on the side of the couch,  and resting his chin upon his hand.
 "I know not what to say or what to  think.
"    "Has aught befallen you, then?"    "Yes, or I have been slave to my own fancy.
 I tell you, lad, that I am  all undone, like a fretted bow-string.
 Hark hither, Alleyne! it  cannot be that you have forgotten little Tita, the daughter of the old  glass-stainer at Bordeaux?"    "I remember her well.
"    "She and I, Alleyne, broke the lucky groat together ere we parted, and  she wears my ring upon her finger.
 'Caro mio,' quoth she when last we  parted, 'I shall be near thee in the wars, and thy danger will be my  danger.
' Alleyne, as God is my help, as I came up the stairs this night  I saw her stand before me, her face in tears, her hands out as though in  warning--I saw it, Alleyne, even as I see those two archers upon their  couches.
 Our very finger-tips seemed to meet, ere she thinned away like  a mist in the sunshine.
"    "I would not give overmuch thought to it," answered Alleyne.
 "Our minds  will play us strange pranks, and bethink you that these words of the  Lady Tiphaine Du Guesclin have wrought upon us and shaken us.
"    Ford shook his head.
 "I saw little Tita as clearly as though I were back  at the Rue des Apotres at Bordeaux," said he.
 "But the hour is late, and  I must go.
"    "Where do you sleep, then?"    "In the chamber above you.
 May the saints be with us all!" He rose  from the couch and left the chamber, while Alleyne could hear his feet  sounding upon the winding stair.
 The young squire walked across to the  window and gazed out at the moonlit landscape, his mind absorbed by  the thought of the Lady Tiphaine, and of the strange words that she  had spoken as to what was going forward at Castle Twynham.
 Leaning his  elbows upon the stonework, he was deeply plunged in reverie, when in a  moment his thoughts were brought back to Villefranche and to the scene  before him.
    The window at which he stood was in the second floor of that portion of  the castle which was nearest to the keep.
 In front lay the broad moat,  with the moon lying upon its surface, now clear and round, now drawn  lengthwise as the breeze stirred the waters.
 Beyond, the plain sloped  down to a thick wood, while further to the left a second wood shut  out the view.
 Between the two an open glade stretched, silvered in the  moonshine, with the river curving across the lower end of it.
    As he gazed, he saw of a sudden a man steal forth from the wood into the  open clearing.
 He walked with his head sunk, his shoulders curved, and  his knees bent, as one who strives hard to remain unseen.
 Ten paces from  the fringe of trees he glanced around, and waving his hand he crouched  down, and was lost to sight among a belt of furze-bushes.
 After him  there came a second man, and after him a third, a fourth, and a fifth  stealing across the narrow open space and darting into the shelter of  the brushwood.
 Nine-and-seventy Alleyne counted of these dark figures  flitting across the line of the moonlight.
 Many bore huge burdens upon  their backs, though what it was that they carried he could not tell at  the distance.
 Out of the one wood and into the other they passed, all  with the same crouching, furtive gait, until the black bristle of trees  had swallowed up the last of them.
    For a moment Alleyne stood in the window, still staring down at the  silent forest, uncertain as to what he should think of these midnight  walkers.
 Then he bethought him that there was one beside him who was  fitter to judge on such a matter.
 His fingers had scarce rested upon  Aylward's shoulder ere the bowman was on his feet, with his hand  outstretched to his sword.
    "Qui va?" he cried.
 "Hola! mon petit.
 By my hilt! I thought there had  been a camisade.
 What then, mon gar.
?"    "Come hither by the window, Aylward," said Alleyne.
 "I have seen  four-score men pass from yonder shaw across the glade, and nigh every  man of them had a great burden on his back.
 What think you of it?"    "I think nothing of it, mon camarade! There are as many masterless folk  in this country as there are rabbits on Cowdray Down, and there are many  who show their faces by night but would dance in a hempen collar if  they stirred forth in the day.
 On all the French marches are droves  of outcasts, reivers, spoilers, and draw-latches, of whom I judge that  these are some, though I marvel that they should dare to come so nigh  to the castle of the seneschal.
 All seems very quiet now," he added,  peering out of the window.
    "They are in the further wood," said Alleyne.
    "And there they may bide.
 Back to rest, mon petit; for, by my hilt! each  day now will bring its own work.
 Yet it would be well to shoot the bolt  in yonder door when one is in strange quarters.
 So!" He threw himself  down upon his pallet and in an instant was fast asleep.
    It might have been about three o'clock in the morning when Alleyne was  aroused from a troubled sleep by a low cry or exclamation.
 He listened,  but, as he heard no more, he set it down as the challenge of the guard  upon the walls, and dropped off to sleep once more.
 A few minutes later  he was disturbed by a gentle creaking of his own door, as though some  one were pushing cautiously against it, and immediately afterwards he  heard the soft thud of cautious footsteps upon the stair which led  to the room above, followed by a confused noise and a muffled groan.
  Alleyne sat up on his couch with all his nerves in a tingle, uncertain  whether these sounds might come from a simple cause--some sick archer  and visiting leech perhaps--or whether they might have a more sinister  meaning.
 But what danger could threaten them here in this strong castle,  under the care of famous warriors, with high walls and a broad moat  around them? Who was there that could injure them? He had well-nigh  persuaded himself that his fears were a foolish fancy, when his eyes  fell upon that which sent the blood cold to his heart and left him  gasping, with hands clutching at the counterpane.
    Right in front of him was the broad window of the chamber, with the moon  shining brightly through it.
 For an instant something had obscured the  light, and now a head was bobbing up and down outside, the face looking  in at him, and swinging slowly from one side of the window to the other.
  Even in that dim light there could be no mistaking those features.
  Drawn, distorted and blood-stained, they were still those of the young  fellow-squire who had sat so recently upon his own couch.
 With a cry of  horror Alleyne sprang from his bed and rushed to the casement, while the  two archers, aroused by the sound, seized their weapons and stared about  them in bewilderment.
 One glance was enough to show Edricson that his  fears were but too true.
 Foully murdered, with a score of wounds upon  him and a rope round his neck, his poor friend had been cast from  the upper window and swung slowly in the night wind, his body rasping  against the wall and his disfigured face upon a level with the casement.
    "My God!" cried Alleyne, shaking in every limb.
 "What has come upon us?  What devil's deed is this?"    "Here is flint and steel," said John stolidly.
 "The lamp, Aylward! This  moonshine softens a man's heart.
 Now we may use the eyes which God hath  given us.
"    "By my hilt!" cried Aylward, as the yellow flame flickered up, "it is  indeed young master Ford, and I think that this seneschal is a black  villain, who dare not face us in the day but would murther us in our  sleep.
 By the twang of string! if I do not soak a goose's feather with  his heart's blood, it will be no fault of Samkin Aylward of the White  Company.
"    "But, Aylward, think of the men whom I saw yesternight," said Alleyne.
  "It may not be the seneschal.
 It may be that others have come into the  castle.
 I must to Sir Nigel ere it be too late.
 Let me go, Aylward, for  my place is by his side.
"    "One moment, mon gar.
 Put that steel head-piece on the end of my  yew-stave.
 So! I will put it first through the door; for it is ill to  come out when you can neither see nor guard yourself.
 Now, camarades,  out swords and stand ready! Hola, by my hilt! it is time that we were  stirring!"    As he spoke, a sudden shouting broke forth in the castle, with the  scream of a woman and the rush of many feet.
 Then came the sharp clink  of clashing steel, and a roar like that of an angry lion--"Notre Dame Du  Guesclin! St.
 Ives! St.
 Ives!" The bow-man pulled back the bolt of the  door, and thrust out the headpiece at the end of the bow.
 A clash, the  clatter of the steel-cap upon the ground, and, ere the man who struck  could heave up for another blow, the archer had passed his sword through  his body.
 "On, camarades, on!" he cried; and, breaking fiercely past two  men who threw themselves in his way, he sped down the broad corridor in  the direction of the shouting.
    A sharp turning, and then a second one, brought them to the head of a  short stair, from which they looked straight down upon the scene of the  uproar.
 A square oak-floored hall lay beneath them, from which opened  the doors of the principal guest-chambers.
 This hall was as light as  day, for torches burned in numerous sconces upon the walls, throwing  strange shadows from the tusked or antlered heads which ornamented them.
  At the very foot of the stair, close to the open door of their chamber,  lay the seneschal and his wife: she with her head shorn from her  shoulders, he thrust through with a sharpened stake, which still  protruded from either side of his body.
 Three servants of the castle lay  dead beside them, all torn and draggled, as though a pack of wolves had  been upon them.
 In front of the central guest-chamber stood Du Guesclin  and Sir Nigel, half-clad and unarmored, with the mad joy of battle  gleaming in their eyes.
 Their heads were thrown back, their lips  compressed, their blood-stained swords poised over their right  shoulders, and their left feet thrown out.
 Three dead men lay huddled  together in front of them: while a fourth, with the blood squirting  from a severed vessel, lay back with updrawn knees, breathing in  wheezy gasps.
 Further back--all panting together, like the wind in a  tree--there stood a group of fierce, wild creatures, bare-armed and  bare-legged, gaunt, unshaven, with deep-set murderous eyes and wild  beast faces.
 With their flashing teeth, their bristling hair, their mad  leapings and screamings, they seemed to Alleyne more like fiends from  the pit than men of flesh and blood.
 Even as he looked, they broke  into a hoarse yell and dashed once more upon the two knights, hurling  themselves madly upon their sword-points; clutching, scrambling, biting,  tearing, careless of wounds if they could but drag the two soldiers to  earth.
 Sir Nigel was thrown down by the sheer weight of them, and Sir  Bertrand with his thunderous war-cry was swinging round his heavy sword  to clear a space for him to rise, when the whistle of two long English  arrows, and the rush of the squire and the two English archers down the  stairs, turned the tide of the combat.
 The assailants gave back, the  knights rushed forward, and in a very few moments the hall was cleared,  and Hordle John had hurled the last of the wild men down the steep steps  which led from the end of it.
    "Do not follow them," cried Du Guesclin.
 "We are lost if we scatter.
 For  myself I care not a denier, though it is a poor thing to meet one's end  at the hands of such scum; but I have my dear lady here, who must by no  means be risked.
 We have breathing-space now, and I would ask you, Sir  Nigel, what it is that you would counsel?"    "By St.
 Paul!" answered Sir Nigel, "I can by no means understand what  hath befallen us, save that I have been woken up by your battle-cry,  and, rushing forth, found myself in the midst of this small bickering.
  Harrow and alas for the lady and the seneschal! What dogs are they who  have done this bloody deed?"    "They are the Jacks, the men of the brushwood.
 They have the castle,  though I know not how it hath come to pass.
 Look from this window into  the bailey.
"    "By heaven!" cried Sir Nigel, "it is as bright as day with the torches.
  The gates stand open, and there are three thousand of them within the  walls.
 See how they rush and scream and wave! What is it that they  thrust out through the postern door? My God! it is a man-at-arms, and  they pluck him limb from limb like hounds on a wolf.
 Now another, and  yet another.
 They hold the whole castle, for I see their faces at the  windows.
 See, there are some with great bundles on their backs.
"    "It is dried wood from the forest.
 They pile them against the walls and  set them in a blaze.
 Who is this who tries to check them? By St.
 Ives!  it is the good priest who spake for them in the hall.
 He kneels, he  prays, he implores! What! villains, would ye raise hands against those  who have befriended you? Ah, the butcher has struck him! He is down!  They stamp him under their feet! They tear off his gown and wave it in  the air! See now, how the flames lick up the walls! Are there none left  to rally round us? With a hundred men we might hold our own.
"    "Oh, for my Company!" cried Sir Nigel.
 "But where is Ford, Alleyne?"    "He is foully murdered, my fair lord.
"    "The saints receive him! May he rest in peace! But here come some at  last who may give us counsel, for amid these passages it is ill to stir  without a guide.
"    As he spoke, a French squire and the Bohemian knight came rushing down  the steps, the latter bleeding from a slash across his forehead.
    "All is lost!" he cried.
 "The castle is taken and on fire, the seneschal  is slain, and there is nought left for us.
"    "On the contrary," quoth Sir Nigel, "there is much left to us, for there  is a very honorable contention before us, and a fair lady for whom to  give our lives.
 There are many ways in which a man might die, but none  better than this.
"    "You can tell us, Godfrey," said Du Guesclin to the French squire: "how  came these men into the castle, and what succors can we count upon? By  St.
 Ives! if we come not quickly to some counsel we shall be burned like  young rooks in a nest.
"    The squire, a dark, slender stripling, spoke firmly and quickly, as one  who was trained to swift action.
 "There is a passage under the earth  into the castle," said he, "and through it some of the Jacks made their  way, casting open the gates for the others.
 They have had help from  within the walls, and the men-at-arms were heavy with wine: they must  have been slain in their beds, for these devils crept from room to room  with soft step and ready knife.
 Sir Amory the Hospitaller was struck  down with an axe as he rushed before us from his sleeping-chamber.
 Save  only ourselves, I do not think that there are any left alive.
"    "What, then, would you counsel?"    "That we make for the keep.
 It is unused, save in time of war, and the  key hangs from my poor lord and master's belt.
"    "There are two keys there.
"    "It is the larger.
 Once there, we might hold the narrow stair; and at  least, as the walls are of a greater thickness, it would be longer ere  they could burn them.
 Could we but carry the lady across the bailey, all  might be well with us.
"    "Nay; the lady hath seen something of the work of war," said Tiphaine  coming forth, as white, as grave, and as unmoved as ever.
 "I would not  be a hamper to you, my dear spouse and gallant friend.
 Rest assured of  this, that if all else fail I have always a safeguard here"--drawing a  small silver-hilted poniard from her bosom--"which sets me beyond the  fear of these vile and blood-stained wretches.
"    "Tiphaine," cried Du Guesclin, "I have always loved you; and now, by Our  Lady of Rennes! I love you more than ever.
 Did I not know that your hand  will be as ready as your words I would myself turn my last blow upon  you, ere you should fall into their hands.
 Lead on, Godfrey! A new  golden pyx will shine in the minster of Dinan if we come safely through  with it.
"    The attention of the insurgents had been drawn away from murder to  plunder, and all over the castle might be heard their cries and whoops  of delight as they dragged forth the rich tapestries, the silver  flagons, and the carved furniture.
 Down in the courtyard half-clad  wretches, their bare limbs all mottled with blood-stains, strutted  about with plumed helmets upon their heads, or with the Lady Rochefort's  silken gowns girt round their loins and trailing on the ground behind  them.
 Casks of choice wine had been rolled out from the cellars, and  starving peasants squatted, goblet in hand, draining off vintages which  De Rochefort had set aside for noble and royal guests.
 Others, with  slabs of bacon and joints of dried meat upon the ends of their pikes,  held them up to the blaze or tore at them ravenously with their teeth.
  Yet all order had not been lost amongst them, for some hundreds of the  better armed stood together in a silent group, leaning upon their rude  weapons and looking up at the fire, which had spread so rapidly as to  involve one whole side of the castle.
 Already Alleyne could hear the  crackling and roaring of the flames, while the air was heavy with heat  and full of the pungent whiff of burning wood.
        .
 HOW FIVE MEN HELD THE KEEP OF VILLEFRANCHE      Under the guidance of the French squire the party passed down two narrow  corridors.
 The first was empty, but at the head of the second stood a  peasant sentry, who started off at the sight of them, yelling loudly to  his comrades.
 "Stop him, or we are undone!" cried Du Guesclin, and had  started to run, when Aylward's great war-bow twanged like a harp-string,  and the man fell forward upon his face, with twitching limbs and  clutching fingers.
 Within five paces of where he lay a narrow and  little-used door led out into the bailey.
 From beyond it came such a  Babel of hooting and screaming, horrible oaths and yet more horrible  laughter, that the stoutest heart might have shrunk from casting down  the frail barrier which faced them.
    "Make straight for the keep!" said Du Guesclin, in a sharp, stern  whisper.
 "The two archers in front, the lady in the centre, a squire  on either side, while we three knights shall bide behind and beat back  those who press upon us.
 So! Now open the door, and God have us in his  holy keeping!"    For a few moments it seemed that their object would be attained without  danger, so swift and so silent had been their movements.
 They were  half-way across the bailey ere the frantic, howling peasants made a  movement to stop them.
 The few who threw themselves in their way were  overpowered or brushed aside, while the pursuers were beaten back by the  ready weapons of the three cavaliers.
 Unscathed they fought their way to  the door of the keep, and faced round upon the swarming mob, while the  squire thrust the great key into the lock.
    "My God!" he cried, "it is the wrong key.
"    "The wrong key!"    "Dolt, fool that I am! This is the key of the castle gate; the other  opens the keep.
 I must back for it!" He turned, with some wild intention  of retracing his steps, but at the instant a great jagged rock, hurled  by a brawny peasant, struck him full upon the ear, and he dropped  senseless to the ground.
    "This is key enough for me!" quoth Hordle John, picking up the huge  stone, and hurling it against the door with all the strength of his  enormous body.
 The lock shivered, the wood smashed, the stone flew into  five pieces, but the iron clamps still held the door in its position.
  Bending down, he thrust his great fingers under it, and with a heave  raised the whole mass of wood and iron from its hinges.
 For a moment it  tottered and swayed, and then, falling outward, buried him in its ruin,  while his comrades rushed into the dark archway which led to safety.
    "Up the steps, Tiphaine!" cried Du Guesclin.
 "Now round, friends, and  beat them back!" The mob of peasants had surged in upon their heels, but  the two trustiest blades in Europe gleamed upon that narrow stair, and  four of their number dropped upon the threshold.
 The others gave back,  and gathered in a half circle round the open door, gnashing their teeth  and shaking their clenched hands at the defenders.
 The body of the  French squire had been dragged out by them and hacked to pieces.
 Three  or four others had pulled John from under the door, when he suddenly  bounded to his feet, and clutching one in either hand dashed them  together with such force that they fell senseless across each other upon  the ground.
 With a kick and a blow he freed himself from two others  who clung to him, and in a moment he was within the portal with his  comrades.
    Yet their position was a desperate one.
 The peasants from far and near  had been assembled for this deed of vengeance, and not less than six  thousand were within or around the walls of the Chateau of Villefranche.
  Ill armed and half starved, they were still desperate men, to whom  danger had lost all fears: for what was death that they should shun  it to cling to such a life as theirs? The castle was theirs, and the  roaring flames were spurting through the windows and flickering high  above the turrets on two sides of the quadrangle.
 From either side they  were sweeping down from room to room and from bastion to bastion in the  direction of the keep.
 Faced by an army, and girt in by fire, were six  men and one woman; but some of them were men so trained to danger and  so wise in war that even now the combat was less unequal than it seemed.
  Courage and resource were penned in by desperation and numbers, while  the great yellow sheets of flame threw their lurid glare over the scene  of death.
    "There is but space for two upon a step to give free play to our  sword-arms," said Du Guesclin.
 "Do you stand with me, Nigel, upon the  lowest.
 France and England will fight together this night.
 Sir Otto, I  pray you to stand behind us with this young squire.
 The archers may go  higher yet and shoot over our heads.
 I would that we had our harness,  Nigel.
"    "Often have I heard my dear Sir John Chandos say that a knight should  never, even when a guest, be parted from it.
 Yet it will be more honor  to us if we come well out of it.
 We have a vantage, since we see them  against the light and they can scarce see us.
 It seems to me that they  muster for an onslaught.
"    "If we can but keep them in play," said the Bohemian, "it is likely  that these flames may bring us succor if there be any true men in the  country.
"    "Bethink you, my fair lord," said Alleyne to Sir Nigel, "that we have  never injured these men, nor have we cause of quarrel against them.
  Would it not be well, if but for the lady's sake, to speak them fair and  see if we may not come to honorable terms with them?"    "Not so, by St.
 Paul!" cried Sir Nigel.
 "It does not accord with mine  honor, nor shall it ever be said that I, a knight of England, was ready  to hold parley with men who have slain a fair lady and a holy priest.
"    "As well hold parley with a pack of ravening wolves," said the French  captain.
 "Ha! Notre Dame Du Guesclin! Saint Ives! Saint Ives!"    As he thundered forth his war-cry, the Jacks who had been gathering  before the black arch of the gateway rushed in madly in a desperate  effort to carry the staircase.
 Their leaders were a small man, dark in  the face, with his beard done up in two plaits, and another larger man,  very bowed in the shoulders, with a huge club studded with sharp nails  in his hand.
 The first had not taken three steps ere an arrow from  Aylward's bow struck him full in the chest, and he fell coughing and  spluttering across the threshold.
 The other rushed onwards, and breaking  between Du Guesclin and Sir Nigel he dashed out the brains of the  Bohemian with a single blow of his clumsy weapon.
 With three swords  through him he still struggled on, and had almost won his way through  them ere he fell dead upon the stair.
 Close at his heels came a hundred  furious peasants, who flung themselves again and again against the five  swords which confronted them.
 It was cut and parry and stab as quick as  eye could see or hand act.
 The door was piled with bodies, and the stone  floor was slippery with blood.
 The deep shout of Du Guesclin, the hard,  hissing breath of the pressing multitude, the clatter of steel, the  thud of falling bodies, and the screams of the stricken, made up such  a medley as came often in after years to break upon Alleyne's sleep.
  Slowly and sullenly at last the throng drew off, with many a fierce  backward glance, while eleven of their number lay huddled in front of  the stair which they had failed to win.
    "The dogs have had enough," said Du Guesclin.
    "By Saint Paul! there appear to be some very worthy and valiant persons  among them," observed Sir Nigel.
 "They are men from whom, had they been  of better birth, much honor and advancement might be gained.
 Even as it  is, it is a great pleasure to have seen them.
 But what is this that they  are bringing forward?"    "It is as I feared," growled Du Guesclin.
 "They will burn us out, since  they cannot win their way past us.
 Shoot straight and hard, archers;  for, by St.
 Ives! our good swords are of little use to us.
"    As he spoke, a dozen men rushed forward, each screening himself behind a  huge fardel of brushwood.
 Hurling their burdens in one vast heap within  the portal, they threw burning torches upon the top of it.
 The wood  had been soaked in oil, for in an instant it was ablaze, and a long,  hissing, yellow flame licked over the heads of the defenders, and drove  them further up to the first floor of the keep.
 They had scarce reached  it, however, ere they found that the wooden joists and planks of the  flooring were already on fire.
 Dry and worm-eaten, a spark upon them  became a smoulder, and a smoulder a blaze.
 A choking smoke filled the  air, and the five could scarce grope their way to the staircase which  led up to the very summit of the square tower.
    Strange was the scene which met their eyes from this eminence.
 Beneath  them on every side stretched the long sweep of peaceful country,  rolling plain, and tangled wood, all softened and mellowed in the silver  moonshine.
 No light, nor movement, nor any sign of human aid could be  seen, but far away the hoarse clangor of a heavy bell rose and fell upon  the wintry air.
 Beneath and around them blazed the huge fire, roaring  and crackling on every side of the bailey, and even as they looked the  two corner turrets fell in with a deafening crash, and the whole castle  was but a shapeless mass, spouting flames and smoke from every window  and embrasure.
 The great black tower upon which they stood rose like a  last island of refuge amid this sea of fire but the ominous crackling  and roaring below showed that it would not be long ere it was engulfed  also in the common ruin.
 At their very feet was the square courtyard,  crowded with the howling and dancing peasants, their fierce faces  upturned, their clenched hands waving, all drunk with bloodshed and with  vengeance.
 A yell of execration and a scream of hideous laughter burst  from the vast throng, as they saw the faces of the last survivors of  their enemies peering down at them from the height of the keep.
 They  still piled the brushwood round the base of the tower, and gambolled  hand in hand around the blaze, screaming out the doggerel lines which  had long been the watchword of the Jacquerie:            Cessez, cessez, gens d'armes et pietons,          De piller et manger le bonhomme          Qui de longtemps Jacques Bonhomme            Se nomme.
    Their thin, shrill voices rose high above the roar of the flames and the  crash of the masonry, like the yelping of a pack of wolves who see their  quarry before them and know that they have well-nigh run him down.
    "By my hilt!" said Aylward to John, "it is in my mind that we shall not  see Spain this journey.
 It is a great joy to me that I have placed  my feather-bed and other things of price with that worthy woman at  Lyndhurst, who will now have the use of them.
 I have thirteen arrows  yet, and if one of them fly unfleshed, then, by the twang of string! I  shall deserve my doom.
 First at him who flaunts with my lady's silken  frock.
 Clap in the clout, by God! though a hand's-breadth lower than  I had meant.
 Now for the rogue with the head upon his pike.
 Ha! to  the inch, John.
 When my eye is true, I am better at rovers than at  long-butts or hoyles.
 A good shoot for you also, John! The villain hath  fallen forward into the fire.
 But I pray you, John, to loose gently, and  not to pluck with the drawing-hand, for it is a trick that hath marred  many a fine bowman.
"    Whilst the two archers were keeping up a brisk fire upon the mob beneath  them, Du Guesclin and his lady were consulting with Sir Nigel upon their  desperate situation.
    "'Tis a strange end for one who has seen so many stricken fields," said  the French chieftain.
 "For me one death is as another, but it is the  thought of my sweet lady which goes to my heart.
"    "Nay, Bertrand, I fear it as little as you," said she.
 "Had I my dearest  wish, it would be that we should go together.
"    "Well answered, fair lady!" cried Sir Nigel.
 "And very sure I am that my  own sweet wife would have said the same.
 If the end be now come, I have  had great good fortune in having lived in times when so much glory was  to be won, and in knowing so many valiant gentlemen and knights.
 But why  do you pluck my sleeve, Alleyne?"    "If it please you, my fair lord, there are in this corner two great  tubes of iron, with many heavy balls, which may perchance be those  bombards and shot of which I have heard.
"    "By Saint Ives! it is true," cried Sir Bertrand, striding across to  the recess where the ungainly, funnel-shaped, thick-ribbed engines were  standing.
 "Bombards they are, and of good size.
 We may shoot down upon  them.
"    "Shoot with them, quotha?" cried Aylward in high disdain, for pressing  danger is the great leveller of classes.
 "How is a man to take aim with  these fool's toys, and how can he hope to do scath with them?"    "I will show you," answered Sir Nigel; "for here is the great box of  powder, and if you will raise it for me, John, I will show you how it  may be used.
 Come hither, where the folk are thickest round the fire.
  Now, Aylward, crane thy neck and see what would have been deemed an old  wife's tale when we first turned our faces to the wars.
 Throw back the  lid, John, and drop the box into the fire!"    A deafening roar, a fluff of bluish light, and the great square tower  rocked and trembled from its very foundations, swaying this way and that  like a reed in the wind.
 Amazed and dizzy, the defenders, clutching at  the cracking parapets for support, saw great stones, burning beams of  wood, and mangled bodies hurtling past them through the air.
 When they  staggered to their feet once more, the whole keep had settled down upon  one side, so that they could scarce keep their footing upon the sloping  platform.
 Gazing over the edge, they looked down upon the horrible  destruction which had been caused by the explosion.
 For forty yards  round the portal the ground was black with writhing, screaming figures,  who struggled up and hurled themselves down again, tossing this way  and that, sightless, scorched, with fire bursting from their tattered  clothing.
 Beyond this circle of death their comrades, bewildered and  amazed, cowered away from this black tower and from these invincible  men, who were most to be dreaded when hope was furthest from their  hearts.
    "A sally, Du Guesclin, a sally!" cried Sir Nigel.
 "By Saint Paul! they  are in two minds, and a bold rush may turn them.
" He drew his sword as  he spoke and darted down the winding stairs, closely followed by his  four comrades.
 Ere he was at the first floor, however, he threw up his  arms and stopped.
 "Mon Dieu!" he said, "we are lost men!"    "What then?" cried those behind him.
    "The wall hath fallen in, the stair is blocked, and the fire still rages  below.
 By Saint Paul! friends, we have fought a very honorable fight,  and may say in all humbleness that we have done our devoir, but I think  that we may now go back to the Lady Tiphaine and say our orisons, for we  have played our parts in this world, and it is time that we made ready  for another.
"    The narrow pass was blocked by huge stones littered in wild confusion  over each other, with the blue choking smoke reeking up through the  crevices.
 The explosion had blown in the wall and cut off the only path  by which they could descend.
 Pent in, a hundred feet from earth, with  a furnace raging under them and a ravening multitude all round who  thirsted for their blood, it seemed indeed as though no men had ever  come through such peril with their lives.
 Slowly they made their way  back to the summit, but as they came out upon it the Lady Tiphaine  darted forward and caught her husband by the wrist.
    "Bertrand," said she, "hush and listen! I have heard the voices of men  all singing together in a strange tongue.
"    Breathless they stood and silent, but no sound came up to them, save the  roar of the flames and the clamor of their enemies.
    "It cannot be, lady," said Du Guesclin.
 "This night hath over wrought  you, and your senses play you false.
 What men are there in this country  who would sing in a strange tongue?"    "Hola!" yelled Aylward, leaping suddenly into the air with waving hands  and joyous face.
 "I thought I heard it ere we went down, and now I hear  it again.
 We are saved, comrades! By these ten finger-bones, we are  saved! It is the marching song of the White Company.
 Hush!"    With upraised forefinger and slanting head, he stood listening.
 Suddenly  there came swelling up a deep-voiced, rollicking chorus from somewhere  out of the darkness.
 Never did choice or dainty ditty of Provence or  Languedoc sound more sweetly in the ears than did the rough-tongued  Saxon to the six who strained their ears from the blazing keep:            We'll drink all together          To the gray goose feather            And the land where the gray goose flew.
    "Ha, by my hilt!" shouted Aylward, "it is the dear old bow song of the  Company.
 Here come two hundred as tight lads as ever twirled a shaft  over their thumbnails.
 Hark to the dogs, how lustily they sing!"    Nearer and clearer, swelling up out of the night, came the gay marching  lilt:            What of the bow?             The bow was made in England.
          Of true wood, of yew wood,             The wood of English bows;          For men who are free          Love the old yew-tree             And the land where the yew tree grows.
            What of the men?             The men were bred in England,          The bowmen, the yeomen,             The lads of the dale and fell,          Here's to you and to you,          To the hearts that are true,             And the land where the true hearts dwell.
    "They sing very joyfully," said Du Guesclin, "as though they were going  to a festival.
"    "It is their wont when there is work to be done.
"    "By Saint Paul!" quoth Sir Nigel, "it is in my mind that they come too  late, for I cannot see how we are to come down from this tower.
"    "There they come, the hearts of gold!" cried Aylward.
 "See, they move  out from the shadow.
 Now they cross the meadow.
 They are on the further  side of the moat.
 Hola camarades, hola! Johnston, Eccles, Cooke,  Harward, Bligh! Would ye see a fair lady and two gallant knights done  foully to death?"    "Who is there?" shouted a deep voice from below.
 "Who is this who speaks  with an English tongue?"    "It is I, old lad.
 It is Sam Aylward of the Company; and here is your  captain, Sir Nigel Loring, and four others, all laid out to be grilled  like an Easterling's herrings.
"    "Curse me if I did not think that it was the style of speech of old  Samkin Aylward," said the voice, amid a buzz from the ranks.
 "Wherever  there are knocks going there is Sammy in the heart of it.
 But who are  these ill-faced rogues who block the path? To your kennels, canaille!  What! you dare look us in the eyes? Out swords, lads, and give them the  flat of them! Waste not your shafts upon such runagate knaves.
"    There was little fight left in the peasants, however, still dazed by the  explosion, amazed at their own losses and disheartened by the arrival of  the disciplined archers.
 In a very few minutes they were in full flight  for their brushwood homes, leaving the morning sun to rise upon a  blackened and blood-stained ruin, where it had left the night before the  magnificent castle of the Seneschal of Auvergne.
 Already the white lines  in the east were deepening into pink as the archers gathered round the  keep and took counsel how to rescue the survivors.
    "Had we a rope," said Alleyne, "there is one side which is not yet on  fire, down which we might slip.
"    "But how to get a rope?"    "It is an old trick," quoth Aylward.
 "Hola! Johnston, cast me up a rope,  even as you did at Maupertuis in the war time.
"    The grizzled archer thus addressed took several lengths of rope from his  comrades, and knotting them firmly together, he stretched them out in  the long shadow which the rising sun threw from the frowning keep.
 Then  he fixed the yew-stave of his bow upon end and measured the long, thin,  black line which it threw upon the turf.
    "A six-foot stave throws a twelve-foot shadow," he muttered.
 "The keep  throws a shadow of sixty paces.
 Thirty paces of rope will be enow and to  spare.
 Another strand, Watkin! Now pull at the end that all may be safe.
  So! It is ready for them.
"    "But how are they to reach it?" asked the young archer beside him.
    "Watch and see, young fool's-head," growled the old bowman.
 He took a  long string from his pouch and fastened one end to an arrow.
    "All ready, Samkin?"    "Ready, camarade.
"    "Close to your hand then.
" With an easy pull he sent the shaft  flickering gently up, falling upon the stonework within a foot of where  Aylward was standing.
 The other end was secured to the rope, so that in  a minute a good strong cord was dangling from the only sound side of the  blazing and shattered tower.
 The Lady Tiphaine was lowered with a noose  drawn fast under the arms, and the other five slid swiftly down, amid  the cheers and joyous outcry of their rescuers.
        .
 HOW THE COMPANY TOOK COUNSEL ROUND THE FALLEN TREE.
      "Where is Sir Claude Latour?" asked Sir Nigel, as his feet touched  ground.
    "He is in camp, near Montpezat, two hours' march from here, my fair  lord," said Johnston, the grizzled bowman who commanded the archers.
    "Then we shall march thither, for I would fain have you all back at Dax  in time to be in the prince's vanguard.
"    "My lord," cried Alleyne, joyfully, "here are our chargers in the field,  and I see your harness amid the plunder which these rogues have left  behind them.
"    "By Saint Ives! you speak sooth, young squire," said Du Guesclin.
 "There  is my horse and my lady's jennet.
 The knaves led them from the stables,  but fled without them.
 Now, Nigel, it is great joy to me to have seen  one of whom I have often heard.
 Yet we must leave you now, for I must be  with the King of Spain ere your army crosses the mountains.
"    "I had thought that you were in Spain with the valiant Henry of  Trastamare.
"    "I have been there, but I came to France to raise succor for him.
 I  shall ride back, Nigel, with four thousand of the best lances of France  at my back, so that your prince may find he hath a task which is worthy  of him.
 God be with you, friend, and may we meet again in better times!"    "I do not think," said Sir Nigel, as he stood by Alleyne's side looking  after the French knight and his lady, "that in all Christendom you will  meet with a more stout-hearted man or a fairer and sweeter dame.
 But  your face is pale and sad, Alleyne! Have you perchance met with some  hurt during the ruffle?"    "Nay, my fair lord, I was but thinking of my friend Ford, and how he sat  upon my couch no later than yesternight.
"    Sir Nigel shook his head sadly.
 "Two brave squires have I lost," said  he.
 "I know not why the young shoots should be plucked, and an old weed  left standing, yet certes there must be some good reason, since God hath  so planned it.
 Did you not note, Alleyne, that the Lady Tiphaine did  give us warning last night that danger was coming upon us?"    "She did, my lord.
"    "By Saint Paul! my mind misgives me as to what she saw at Twynham  Castle.
 And yet I cannot think that any Scottish or French rovers could  land in such force as to beleaguer the fortalice.
 Call the Company  together, Aylward; and let us on, for it will be shame to us if we are  not at Dax upon the trysting day.
"    The archers had spread themselves over the ruins, but a blast upon a  bugle brought them all back to muster, with such booty as they could  bear with them stuffed into their pouches or slung over their shoulders.
  As they formed into ranks, each man dropping silently into his place,  Sir Nigel ran a questioning eye over them, and a smile of pleasure  played over his face.
 Tall and sinewy, and brown, clear-eyed,  hard-featured, with the stern and prompt bearing of experienced  soldiers, it would be hard indeed for a leader to seek for a choicer  following.
 Here and there in the ranks were old soldiers of the French  wars, grizzled and lean, with fierce, puckered features and shaggy,  bristling brows.
 The most, however, were young and dandy archers, with  fresh English faces, their beards combed out, their hair curling from  under their close steel hufkens, with gold or jewelled earrings gleaming  in their ears, while their gold-spangled baldrics, their silken belts,  and the chains which many of them wore round their thick brown necks,  all spoke of the brave times which they had had as free companions.
 Each  had a yew or hazel stave slung over his shoulder, plain and serviceable  with the older men, but gaudily painted and carved at either end with  the others.
 Steel caps, mail brigandines, white surcoats with the red  lion of St.
 George, and sword or battle-axe swinging from their belts,  completed this equipment, while in some cases the murderous maule or  five-foot mallet was hung across the bowstave, being fastened to their  leathern shoulder-belt by a hook in the centre of the handle.
 Sir  Nigel's heart beat high as he looked upon their free bearing and  fearless faces.
    For two hours they marched through forest and marshland, along the left  bank of the river Aveyron; Sir Nigel riding behind his Company, with  Alleyne at his right hand, and Johnston, the old master bowman, walking  by his left stirrup.
 Ere they had reached their journey's end the knight  had learned all that he would know of his men, their doings and their  intentions.
 Once, as they marched, they saw upon the further bank of the  river a body of French men-at-arms, riding very swiftly in the direction  of Villefranche.
    "It is the Seneschal of Toulouse, with his following," said Johnston,  shading his eyes with his hand.
 "Had he been on this side of the water  he might have attempted something upon us.
"    "I think that it would be well that we should cross," said Sir Nigel.
  "It were pity to balk this worthy seneschal, should he desire to try  some small feat of arms.
"    "Nay, there is no ford nearer than Tourville," answered the old archer.
  "He is on his way to Villefranche, and short will be the shrift of any  Jacks who come into his hands, for he is a man of short speech.
 It  was he and the Seneschal of Beaucaire who hung Peter Wilkins, of the  Company, last Lammastide; for which, by the black rood of Waltham! they  shall hang themselves, if ever they come into our power.
 But here are  our comrades, Sir Nigel, and here is our camp.
"    As he spoke, the forest pathway along which they marched opened out into  a green glade, which sloped down towards the river.
 High, leafless trees  girt it in on three sides, with a thick undergrowth of holly between  their trunks.
 At the farther end of this forest clearing there stood  forty or fifty huts, built very neatly from wood and clay, with the  blue smoke curling out from the roofs.
 A dozen tethered horses and mules  grazed around the encampment, while a number of archers lounged about:  some shooting at marks, while others built up great wooden fires in the  open, and hung their cooking kettles above them.
 At the sight of their  returning comrades there was a shout of welcome, and a horseman, who  had been exercising his charger behind the camp, came cantering down  to them.
 He was a dapper, brisk man, very richly clad, with a round,  clean-shaven face, and very bright black eyes, which danced and sparkled  with excitement.
    "Sir Nigel!" he cried.
 "Sir Nigel Loring, at last! By my soul we have  awaited you this month past.
 Right welcome, Sir Nigel! You have had my  letter?"    "It was that which brought me here," said Sir Nigel.
 "But indeed, Sir  Claude Latour, it is a great wonder to me that you did not yourself lead  these bowmen, for surely they could have found no better leader?"    "None, none, by the Virgin of L'Esparre!" he cried, speaking in the  strange, thick Gascon speech which turns every _v_ into a _b_.
 "But you  know what these islanders of yours are, Sir Nigel.
 They will not be led  by any save their own blood and race.
 There is no persuading them.
  Not even I, Claude Latour Seigneur of Montchateau, master of the high  justice, the middle and the low, could gain their favor.
 They must needs  hold a council and put their two hundred thick heads together, and then  there comes this fellow Aylward and another, as their spokesmen, to say  that they will disband unless an Englishman of good name be set over  them.
 There are many of them, as I understand, who come from some great  forest which lies in Hampi, or Hampti--I cannot lay my tongue to the  name.
 Your dwelling is in those parts, and so their thoughts turned to  you as their leader.
 But we had hoped that you would bring a hundred men  with you.
"    "They are already at Dax, where we shall join them," said Sir Nigel.
  "But let the men break their fast, and we shall then take counsel what  to do.
"    "Come into my hut," said Sir Claude.
 "It is but poor fare that I can lay  before you--milk, cheese, wine, and bacon--yet your squire and yourself  will doubtless excuse it.
 This is my house where the pennon flies before  the door--a small residence to contain the Lord of Montchateau.
"    Sir Nigel sat silent and distrait at his meal, while Alleyne hearkened  to the clattering tongue of the Gascon, and to his talk of the glories  of his own estate, his successes in love, and his triumphs in war.
    "And now that you are here, Sir Nigel," he said at last, "I have many  fine ventures all ready for us.
 I have heard that Montpezat is of no  great strength, and that there are two hundred thousand crowns in the  castle.
 At Castelnau also there is a cobbler who is in my pay, and who  will throw us a rope any dark night from his house by the town wall.
 I  promise you that you shall thrust your arms elbow-deep among good silver  pieces ere the nights are moonless again; for on every hand of us are  fair women, rich wine, and good plunder, as much as heart could wish.
"    "I have other plans," answered Sir Nigel curtly; "for I have come hither  to lead these bowmen to the help of the prince, our master, who may have  sore need of them ere he set Pedro upon the throne of Spain.
 It is my  purpose to start this very day for Dax upon the Adour, where he hath now  pitched his camp.
"    The face of the Gascon darkened, and his eyes flashed with resentment.
  "For me," he said, "I care little for this war, and I find the life  which I lead a very joyous and pleasant one.
 I will not go to Dax.
"    "Nay, think again, Sir Claude," said Sir Nigel gently; "for you have  ever had the name of a true and loyal knight.
 Surely you will not hold  back now when your master hath need of you.
"    "I will not go to Dax," the other shouted.
    "But your devoir--your oath of fealty?"    "I say that I will not go.
"    "Then, Sir Claude, I must lead the Company without you.
"    "If they will follow," cried the Gascon with a sneer.
 "These are not  hired slaves, but free companions, who will do nothing save by their own  good wills.
 In very sooth, my Lord Loring, they are ill men to trifle  with, and it were easier to pluck a bone from a hungry bear than to lead  a bowman out of a land of plenty and of pleasure.
"    "Then I pray you to gather them together," said Sir Nigel, "and I will  tell them what is in my mind; for if I am their leader they must to Dax,  and if I am not then I know not what I am doing in Auvergne.
 Have my  horse ready, Alleyne; for, by St.
 Paul! come what may, I must be upon  the homeward road ere mid-day.
"    A blast upon the bugle summoned the bowmen to counsel, and they gathered  in little knots and groups around a great fallen tree which lay athwart  the glade.
 Sir Nigel sprang lightly upon the trunk, and stood with  blinking eye and firm lips looking down at the ring of upturned warlike  faces.
    "They tell me, bowmen," said he, "that ye have grown so fond of ease and  plunder and high living that ye are not to be moved from this pleasant  country.
 But, by Saint Paul! I will believe no such thing of you, for  I can readily see that you are all very valiant men, who would scorn to  live here in peace when your prince hath so great a venture before him.
  Ye have chosen me as a leader, and a leader I will be if ye come with  me to Spain; and I vow to you that my pennon of the five roses shall, if  God give me strength and life, be ever where there is most honor to  be gained.
 But if it be your wish to loll and loiter in these glades,  bartering glory and renown for vile gold and ill-gotten riches, then  ye must find another leader; for I have lived in honor, and in honor I  trust that I shall die.
 If there be forest men or Hampshire men amongst  ye, I call upon them to say whether they will follow the banner of  Loring.
"    "Here's a Romsey man for you!" cried a young bowman with a sprig of  evergreen set in his helmet.
    "And a lad from Alresford!" shouted another.
    "And from Milton!"    "And from Burley!"    "And from Lymington!"    "And a little one from Brockenhurst!" shouted a huge-limbed fellow who  sprawled beneath a tree.
    "By my hilt! lads," cried Aylward, jumping upon the fallen trunk, "I  think that we could not look the girls in the eyes if we let the prince  cross the mountains and did not pull string to clear a path for him.
  It is very well in time of peace to lead such a life as we have had  together, but now the war-banner is in the wind once more, and, by these  ten finger-bones! if he go alone, old Samkin Aylward will walk beside  it.
"    These words from a man as popular as Aylward decided many of the  waverers, and a shout of approval burst from his audience.
    "Far be it from me," said Sir Claude Latour suavely, "to persuade you  against this worthy archer, or against Sir Nigel Loring; yet we have  been together in many ventures, and perchance it may not be amiss if I  say to you what I think upon the matter.
"    "Peace for the little Gascon!" cried the archers.
 "Let every man have  his word.
 Shoot straight for the mark, lad, and fair play for all.
"    "Bethink you, then," said Sir Claude, "that you go under a hard rule,  with neither freedom nor pleasure--and for what? For sixpence a day,  at the most; while now you may walk across the country and stretch out  either hand to gather in whatever you have a mind for.
 What do we not  hear of our comrades who have gone with Sir John Hawkwood to Italy? In  one night they have held to ransom six hundred of the richest noblemen  of Mantua.
 They camp before a great city, and the base burghers come  forth with the keys, and then they make great spoil; or, if it please  them better, they take so many horse-loads of silver as a composition;  and so they journey on from state to state, rich and free and feared by  all.
 Now, is not that the proper life for a soldier?"    "The proper life for a robber!" roared Hordle John, in his thundering  voice.
    "And yet there is much in what the Gascon says," said a swarthy fellow  in a weather-stained doublet; "and I for one would rather prosper in  Italy than starve in Spain.
"    "You were always a cur and a traitor, Mark Shaw," cried Aylward.
 "By  my hilt! if you will stand forth and draw your sword I will warrant you  that you will see neither one nor the other.
"    "Nay, Aylward," said Sir Nigel, "we cannot mend the matter by broiling.
  Sir Claude, I think that what you have said does you little honor, and  if my words aggrieve you I am ever ready to go deeper into the matter  with you.
 But you shall have such men as will follow you, and you may  go where you will, so that you come not with us.
 Let all who love  their prince and country stand fast, while those who think more of a  well-lined purse step forth upon the farther side.
"    Thirteen bowmen, with hung heads and sheepish faces, stepped forward  with Mark Shaw and ranged themselves behind Sir Claude.
 Amid the  hootings and hissings of their comrades, they marched off together to  the Gascon's hut, while the main body broke up their meeting and set  cheerily to work packing their possessions, furbishing their weapons,  and preparing for the march which lay before them.
 Over the Tarn and the  Garonne, through the vast quagmires of Armagnac, past the swift-flowing  Losse, and so down the long valley of the Adour, there was many a  long league to be crossed ere they could join themselves to that dark  war-cloud which was drifting slowly southwards to the line of the snowy  peaks, beyond which the banner of England had never yet been seen.
        .
 HOW THE ARMY MADE THE PASSAGE OF RONCESVALLES.
      The whole vast plain of Gascony and of Languedoc is an arid and  profitless expanse in winter save where the swift-flowing Adour and her  snow-fed tributaries, the Louts, the Oloron and the Pau, run down to  the sea of Biscay.
 South of the Adour the jagged line of mountains which  fringe the sky-line send out long granite claws, running down into the  lowlands and dividing them into "gaves" or stretches of valley.
 Hillocks  grow into hills, and hills into mountains, each range overlying its  neighbor, until they soar up in the giant chain which raises its  spotless and untrodden peaks, white and dazzling, against the pale blue  wintry sky.
    A quiet land is this--a land where the slow-moving Basque, with his flat  biretta-cap, his red sash and his hempen sandals, tills his scanty farm  or drives his lean flock to their hill-side pastures.
 It is the country  of the wolf and the isard, of the brown bear and the mountain-goat, a  land of bare rock and of rushing water.
 Yet here it was that the will of  a great prince had now assembled a gallant army; so that from the Adour  to the passes of Navarre the barren valleys and wind-swept wastes were  populous with soldiers and loud with the shouting of orders and the  neighing of horses.
 For the banners of war had been flung to the wind  once more, and over those glistening peaks was the highway along which  Honor pointed in an age when men had chosen her as their guide.
    And now all was ready for the enterprise.
 From Dax to St.
 Jean  Pied-du-Port the country was mottled with the white tents of Gascons,  Aquitanians and English, all eager for the advance.
 From all sides the  free companions had trooped in, until not less than twelve thousand of  these veteran troops were cantoned along the frontiers of Navarre.
 From  England had arrived the prince's brother, the Duke of Lancaster, with  four hundred knights in his train and a strong company of archers.
 Above  all, an heir to the throne had been born in Bordeaux, and the prince  might leave his spouse with an easy mind, for all was well with mother  and with child.
    The keys of the mountain passes still lay in the hands of the shifty and  ignoble Charles of Navarre, who had chaffered and bargained both with  the English and with the Spanish, taking money from the one side to hold  them open and from the other to keep them sealed.
 The mallet hand of  Edward, however, had shattered all the schemes and wiles of the plotter.
  Neither entreaty nor courtly remonstrance came from the English prince;  but Sir Hugh Calverley passed silently over the border with his company,  and the blazing walls of the two cities of Miranda and Puenta de la  Reyna warned the unfaithful monarch that there were other metals besides  gold, and that he was dealing with a man to whom it was unsafe to lie.
  His price was paid, his objections silenced, and the mountain gorges lay  open to the invaders.
 From the Feast of the Epiphany there was mustering  and massing, until, in the first week of February--three days after the  White Company joined the army--the word was given for a general advance  through the defile of Roncesvalles.
 At five in the cold winter's morning  the bugles were blowing in the hamlet of St.
 Jean Pied-du-Port, and by  six Sir Nigel's Company, three hundred strong, were on their way for the  defile, pushing swiftly in the dim light up the steep curving road; for  it was the prince's order that they should be the first to pass through,  and that they should remain on guard at the further end until the whole  army had emerged from the mountains.
 Day was already breaking in the  east, and the summits of the great peaks had turned rosy red, while the  valleys still lay in the shadow, when they found themselves with the  cliffs on either hand and the long, rugged pass stretching away before  them.
    Sir Nigel rode his great black war-horse at the head of his archers,  dressed in full armor, with Black Simon bearing his banner behind him,  while Alleyne at his bridle-arm carried his blazoned shield and his  well-steeled ashen spear.
 A proud and happy man was the knight, and many  a time he turned in his saddle to look at the long column of bowmen who  swung swiftly along behind him.
    "By Saint Paul! Alleyne," said he, "this pass is a very perilous place,  and I would that the King of Navarre had held it against us, for it  would have been a very honorable venture had it fallen to us to win a  passage.
 I have heard the minstrels sing of one Sir Roland who was slain  by the infidels in these very parts.
"    "If it please you, my fair lord," said Black Simon, "I know something  of these parts, for I have twice served a term with the King of Navarre.
  There is a hospice of monks yonder, where you may see the roof among the  trees, and there it was that Sir Roland was slain.
 The village upon the  left is Orbaiceta, and I know a house therein where the right wine of  Jurancon is to be bought, if it would please you to quaff a morning  cup.
"    "There is smoke yonder upon the right.
"    "That is a village named Les Aldudes, and I know a hostel there also  where the wine is of the best.
 It is said that the inn-keeper hath a  buried treasure, and I doubt not, my fair lord, that if you grant me  leave I could prevail upon him to tell us where he hath hid it.
"    "Nay, nay, Simon," said Sir Nigel curtly, "I pray you to forget these  free companion tricks.
 Ha! Edricson, I see that you stare about you, and  in good sooth these mountains must seem wondrous indeed to one who hath  but seen Butser or the Portsdown hill.
"    The broken and rugged road had wound along the crests of low hills,  with wooded ridges on either side of it over which peeped the loftier  mountains, the distant Peak of the South and the vast Altabisca, which  towered high above them and cast its black shadow from left to right  across the valley.
 From where they now stood they could look forward  down a long vista of beech woods and jagged rock-strewn wilderness, all  white with snow, to where the pass opened out upon the uplands beyond.
  Behind them they could still catch a glimpse of the gray plains of  Gascony, and could see her rivers gleaming like coils of silver in the  sunshine.
 As far as eye could see from among the rocky gorges and the  bristles of the pine woods there came the quick twinkle and glitter of  steel, while the wind brought with it sudden distant bursts of martial  music from the great host which rolled by every road and by-path towards  the narrow pass of Roncesvalles.
 On the cliffs on either side might also  be seen the flash of arms and the waving of pennons where the force of  Navarre looked down upon the army of strangers who passed through their  territories.
    "By Saint Paul!" said Sir Nigel, blinking up at them, "I think that  we have much to hope for from these cavaliers, for they cluster very  thickly upon our flanks.
 Pass word to the men, Aylward, that they  unsling their bows, for I have no doubt that there are some very  worthy gentlemen yonder who may give us some opportunity for honorable  advancement.
"    "I hear that the prince hath the King of Navarre as hostage," said  Alleyne, "and it is said that he hath sworn to put him to death if there  be any attack upon us.
"    "It was not so that war was made when good King Edward first turned his  hand to it," said Sir Nigel sadly.
 "Ah! Alleyne, I fear that you will  never live to see such things, for the minds of men are more set upon  money and gain than of old.
 By Saint Paul! it was a noble sight when two  great armies would draw together upon a certain day, and all who had  a vow would ride forth to discharge themselves of it.
 What noble  spear-runnings have I not seen, and even in an humble way had a part in,  when cavaliers would run a course for the easing of their souls and for  the love of their ladies! Never a bad word have I for the French, for,  though I have ridden twenty times up to their array, I have never yet  failed to find some very gentle and worthy knight or squire who was  willing to do what he might to enable me to attempt some small feat of  arms.
 Then, when all cavaliers had been satisfied, the two armies would  come to hand-strokes, and fight right merrily until one or other had the  vantage.
 By Saint Paul! it was not our wont in those days to pay gold  for the opening of passes, nor would we hold a king as hostage lest  his people come to thrusts with us.
 In good sooth, if the war is to be  carried out in such a fashion, then it is grief to me that I ever came  away from Castle Twynham, for I would not have left my sweet lady had I  not thought that there were deeds of arms to be done.
"    "But surely, my fair lord," said Alleyne, "you have done some great  feats of arms since we left the Lady Loring.
"    "I cannot call any to mind," answered Sir Nigel.
    "There was the taking of the sea-rovers, and the holding of the keep  against the Jacks.
"    "Nay, nay," said the knight, "these were not feats of arms, but mere  wayside ventures and the chances of travel.
 By Saint Paul! if it were  not that these hills are over-steep for Pommers, I would ride to these  cavaliers of Navarre and see if there were not some among them who would  help me to take this patch from mine eye.
 It is a sad sight to see this  very fine pass, which my own Company here could hold against an army,  and yet to ride through it with as little profit as though it were the  lane from my kennels to the Avon.
"    All morning Sir Nigel rode in a very ill-humor, with his Company  tramping behind him.
 It was a toilsome march over broken ground and  through snow, which came often as high as the knee, yet ere the sun had  begun to sink they had reached the spot where the gorge opens out on to  the uplands of Navarre, and could see the towers of Pampeluna jutting  up against the southern sky-line.
 Here the Company were quartered in a  scattered mountain hamlet, and Alleyne spent the day looking down  upon the swarming army which poured with gleam of spears and flaunt of  standards through the narrow pass.
    "Hola, mon gar.
," said Aylward, seating himself upon a boulder by his  side.
 "This is indeed a fine sight upon which it is good to look, and a  man might go far ere he would see so many brave men and fine horses.
  By my hilt! our little lord is wroth because we have come peacefully  through the passes, but I will warrant him that we have fighting  enow ere we turn our faces northward again.
 It is said that there are  four-score thousand men behind the King of Spain, with Du Guesclin and  all the best lances of France, who have sworn to shed their heart's  blood ere this Pedro come again to the throne.
"    "Yet our own army is a great one," said Alleyne.
    "Nay, there are but seven-and-twenty thousand men.
 Chandos hath  persuaded the prince to leave many behind, and indeed I think that he is  right, for there is little food and less water in these parts for which  we are bound.
 A man without his meat or a horse without his fodder is  like a wet bow-string, fit for little.
 But voila, mon petit, here comes  Chandos and his company, and there is many a pensil and banderole among  yonder squadrons which show that the best blood of England is riding  under his banners.
"    Whilst Aylward had been speaking, a strong column of archers had defiled  through the pass beneath them.
 They were followed by a banner-bearer  who held high the scarlet wedge upon a silver field which proclaimed the  presence of the famous warrior.
 He rode himself within a spear's-length  of his standard, clad from neck to foot in steel, but draped in the long  linen gown or parement which was destined to be the cause of his death.
  His plumed helmet was carried behind him by his body-squire, and his  head was covered by a small purple cap, from under which his snow-white  hair curled downwards to his shoulders.
 With his long beak-like nose and  his single gleaming eye, which shone brightly from under a thick tuft  of grizzled brow, he seemed to Alleyne to have something of the look  of some fierce old bird of prey.
 For a moment he smiled, as his eye lit  upon the banner of the five roses waving from the hamlet; but his course  lay for Pampeluna, and he rode on after the archers.
    Close at his heels came sixteen squires, all chosen from the highest  families, and behind them rode twelve hundred English knights, with  gleam of steel and tossing of plumes, their harness jingling, their long  straight swords clanking against their stirrup-irons, and the beat of  their chargers' hoofs like the low deep roar of the sea upon the shore.
  Behind them marched six hundred Cheshire and Lancashire archers, bearing  the badge of the Audleys, followed by the famous Lord Audley himself,  with the four valiant squires, Dutton of Dutton, Delves of Doddington,  Fowlehurst of Crewe, and Hawkestone of Wainehill, who had all won such  glory at Poictiers.
 Two hundred heavily-armed cavalry rode behind the  Audley standard, while close at their heels came the Duke of Lancaster  with a glittering train, heralds tabarded with the royal arms riding  three deep upon cream-colored chargers in front of him.
 On either side  of the young prince rode the two seneschals of Aquitaine, Sir Guiscard  d'Angle and Sir Stephen Cossington, the one bearing the banner of the  province and the other that of Saint George.
 Away behind him as far as  eye could reach rolled the far-stretching, unbroken river of steel--rank  after rank and column after column, with waving of plumes, glitter of  arms, tossing of guidons, and flash and flutter of countless armorial  devices.
 All day Alleyne looked down upon the changing scene, and all  day the old bowman stood by his elbow, pointing out the crests of famous  warriors and the arms of noble houses.
 Here were the gold mullets of the  Pakingtons, the sable and ermine of the Mackworths, the scarlet bars of  the Wakes, the gold and blue of the Grosvenors, the cinque-foils of  the Cliftons, the annulets of the Musgraves, the silver pinions of the  Beauchamps, the crosses of the Molineaux, the bloody chevron of the  Woodhouses, the red and silver of the Worsleys, the swords of the  Clarks, the boars'-heads of the Lucies, the crescents of the Boyntons,  and the wolf and dagger of the Lipscombs.
 So through the sunny winter  day the chivalry of England poured down through the dark pass of  Roncesvalles to the plains of Spain.
    It was on a Monday that the Duke of Lancaster's division passed safely  through the Pyrenees.
 On the Tuesday there was a bitter frost, and the  ground rung like iron beneath the feet of the horses; yet ere evening  the prince himself, with the main battle of his army, had passed the  gorge and united with his vanguard at Pampeluna.
 With him rode the King  of Majorca, the hostage King of Navarre, and the fierce Don Pedro of  Spain, whose pale blue eyes gleamed with a sinister light as they rested  once more upon the distant peaks of the land which had disowned him.
  Under the royal banners rode many a bold Gascon baron and many a  hot-blooded islander.
 Here were the high stewards of Aquitaine, of  Saintonge, of La Rochelle, of Quercy, of Limousin, of Agenois, of  Poitou, and of Bigorre, with the banners and musters of their provinces.
  Here also were the valiant Earl of Angus, Sir Thomas Banaster with his  garter over his greave, Sir Nele Loring, second cousin to Sir Nigel,  and a long column of Welsh footmen who marched under the red banner  of Merlin.
 From dawn to sundown the long train wound through the pass,  their breath reeking up upon the frosty air like the steam from a  cauldron.
    The weather was less keen upon the Wednesday, and the rear-guard  made good their passage, with the bombards and the wagon-train.
 Free  companions and Gascons made up this portion of the army to the number of  ten thousand men.
 The fierce Sir Hugh Calverley, with his yellow mane,  and the rugged Sir Robert Knolles, with their war-hardened and veteran  companies of English bowmen, headed the long column; while behind them  came the turbulent bands of the Bastard of Breteuil, Nandon de Bagerant,  one-eyed Camus, Black Ortingo, La Nuit and others whose very names seem  to smack of hard hands and ruthless deeds.
 With them also were the  pick of the Gascon chivalry--the old Duc d'Armagnac, his nephew Lord  d'Albret, brooding and scowling over his wrongs, the giant Oliver de  Clisson, the Captal de Buch, pink of knighthood, the sprightly Sir  Perducas d'Albret, the red-bearded Lord d'Esparre, and a long train of  needy and grasping border nobles, with long pedigrees and short purses,  who had come down from their hill-side strongholds, all hungering for  the spoils and the ransoms of Spain.
 By the Thursday morning the whole  army was encamped in the Vale of Pampeluna, and the prince had called  his council to meet him in the old palace of the ancient city of  Navarre.
        .
 HOW THE COMPANY MADE SPORT IN THE VALE OF PAMPELUNA.
      Whilst the council was sitting in Pampeluna the White Company, having  encamped in a neighboring valley, close to the companies of La Nuit and  of Black Ortingo, were amusing themselves with sword-play, wrestling,  and shooting at the shields, which they had placed upon the hillside  to serve them as butts.
 The younger archers, with their coats of mail  thrown aside, their brown or flaxen hair tossing in the wind, and their  jerkins turned back to give free play to their brawny chests and arms,  stood in lines, each loosing his shaft in turn, while Johnston, Aylward,  Black Simon, and half-a-score of the elders lounged up and down with  critical eyes, and a word of rough praise or of curt censure for the  marksmen.
 Behind stood knots of Gascon and Brabant crossbowmen from  the companies of Ortingo and of La Nuit, leaning upon their unsightly  weapons and watching the practice of the Englishmen.
    "A good shot, Hewett, a good shot!" said old Johnston to a young bowman,  who stood with his bow in his left hand, gazing with parted lips after  his flying shaft.
 "You see, she finds the ring, as I knew she would from  the moment that your string twanged.
"    "Loose it easy, steady, and yet sharp," said Aylward.
 "By my hilt! mon  gar.
, it is very well when you do but shoot at a shield, but when there  is a man behind the shield, and he rides at you with wave of sword and  glint of eyes from behind his vizor, you may find him a less easy mark.
"    "It is a mark that I have found before now," answered the young bowman.
    "And shall again, camarade, I doubt not.
 But hola! Johnston, who is this  who holds his bow like a crow-keeper?"    "It is Silas Peterson, of Horsham.
 Do not wink with one eye and look  with the other, Silas, and do not hop and dance after you shoot, with  your tongue out, for that will not speed it upon its way.
 Stand straight  and firm, as God made you.
 Move not the bow arm, and steady with the  drawing hand!"    "I' faith," said Black Simon, "I am a spearman myself, and am more  fitted for hand-strokes than for such work as this.
 Yet I have spent my  days among bowmen, and I have seen many a brave shaft sped.
 I will not  say but that we have some good marksmen here, and that this Company  would be accounted a fine body of archers at any time or place.
 Yet I  do not see any men who bend so strong a bow or shoot as true a shaft as  those whom I have known.
"    "You say sooth," said Johnston, turning his seamed and grizzled face  upon the man-at-arms.
 "See yonder," he added, pointing to a bombard  which lay within the camp: "there is what hath done scath to good  bowmanship, with its filthy soot and foolish roaring mouth.
 I wonder  that a true knight, like our prince, should carry such a scurvy thing in  his train.
 Robin, thou red-headed lurden, how oft must I tell thee not  to shoot straight with a quarter-wind blowing across the mark?"    "By these ten finger-bones! there were some fine bowmen at the intaking  of Calais," said Aylward.
 "I well remember that, on occasion of an  outfall, a Genoan raised his arm over his mantlet, and shook it at us, a  hundred paces from our line.
 There were twenty who loosed shafts at him,  and when the man was afterwards slain it was found that he had taken  eighteen through his forearm.
"    "And I can call to mind," remarked Johnston, "that when the great  cog 'Christopher,' which the French had taken from us, was moored two  hundred paces from the shore, two archers, little Robin Withstaff and  Elias Baddlesmere, in four shots each cut every strand of her hempen  anchor-cord, so that she well-nigh came upon the rocks.
"    "Good shooting, i' faith rare shooting!" said Black Simon.
 "But I have  seen you, Johnston, and you, Samkin Aylward, and one or two others who  are still with us, shoot as well as the best.
 Was it not you, Johnston,  who took the fat ox at Finsbury butts against the pick of London town?"    A sunburnt and black-eyed Brabanter had stood near the old archers,  leaning upon a large crossbow and listening to their talk, which had  been carried on in that hybrid camp dialect which both nations could  understand.
 He was a squat, bull-necked man, clad in the iron helmet,  mail tunic, and woollen gambesson of his class.
 A jacket with hanging  sleeves, slashed with velvet at the neck and wrists, showed that he was  a man of some consideration, an under-officer, or file-leader of his  company.
    "I cannot think," said he, "why you English should be so fond of your  six-foot stick.
 If it amuse you to bend it, well and good; but why  should I strain and pull, when my little moulinet will do all for me,  and better than I can do it for myself?"    "I have seen good shooting with the prod and with the latch," said  Aylward, "but, by my hilt! camarade, with all respect to you and to your  bow, I think that is but a woman's weapon, which a woman can point and  loose as easily as a man.
"    "I know not about that," answered the Brabanter, "but this I know,  that though I have served for fourteen years, I have never yet seen an  Englishman do aught with the long-bow which I could not do better with  my arbalest.
 By the three kings! I would even go further, and say that I  have done things with my arbalest which no Englishman could do with his  long-bow.
"    "Well said, mon gar.
," cried Aylward.
 "A good cock has ever a brave  call.
 Now, I have shot little of late, but there is Johnston here who  will try a round with you for the honor of the Company.
"    "And I will lay a gallon of Jurancon wine upon the long-bow," said Black  Simon, "though I had rather, for my own drinking, that it were a quart  of Twynham ale.
"    "I take both your challenge and your wager," said the man of Brabant,  throwing off his jacket and glancing keenly about him with his black,  twinkling eyes.
 "I cannot see any fitting mark, for I care not to waste  a bolt upon these shields, which a drunken boor could not miss at a  village kermesse.
"    "This is a perilous man," whispered an English man-at-arms, plucking at  Aylward's sleeve.
 "He is the best marksman of all the crossbow companies  and it was he who brought down the Constable de Bourbon at Brignais.
 I  fear that your man will come by little honor with him.
"    "Yet I have seen Johnston shoot these twenty years, and I will not  flinch from it.
 How say you, old war-hound, will you not have a flight  shot or two with this springald?"    "Tut, tut, Aylward," said the old bowman.
 "My day is past, and it is  for the younger ones to hold what we have gained.
 I take it unkindly of  thee, Samkin, that thou shouldst call all eyes thus upon a broken bowman  who could once shoot a fair shaft.
 Let me feel that bow, Wilkins! It is  a Scotch bow, I see, for the upper nock is without and the lower within.
  By the black rood! it is a good piece of yew, well nocked, well strung,  well waxed, and very joyful to the feel.
 I think even now that I might  hit any large and goodly mark with a bow like this.
 Turn thy quiver to  me, Aylward.
 I love an ash arrow pierced with cornel-wood for a roving  shaft.
"    "By my hilt! and so do I," cried Aylward.
 "These three gander-winged  shafts are such.
"    "So I see, comrade.
 It has been my wont to choose a saddle-backed  feather for a dead shaft, and a swine-backed for a smooth flier.
 I will  take the two of them.
 Ah! Samkin, lad, the eye grows dim and the hand  less firm as the years pass.
"    "Come then, are you not ready?" said the Brabanter, who had watched  with ill-concealed impatience the slow and methodic movements of his  antagonist.
    "I will venture a rover with you, or try long-butts or hoyles," said old  Johnston.
 "To my mind the long-bow is a better weapon than the arbalest,  but it may be ill for me to prove it.
"    "So I think," quoth the other with a sneer.
 He drew his moulinet from  his girdle, and fixing it to the windlass, he drew back the powerful  double cord until it had clicked into the catch.
 Then from his quiver he  drew a short, thick quarrel, which he placed with the utmost care upon  the groove.
 Word had spread of what was going forward, and the rivals  were already surrounded, not only by the English archers of the Company,  but by hundreds of arbalestiers and men-at-arms from the bands of  Ortingo and La Nuit, to the latter of which the Brabanter belonged.
    "There is a mark yonder on the hill," said he; "mayhap you can discern  it.
"    "I see something," answered Johnston, shading his eyes with his hand;  "but it is a very long shoot.
"    "A fair shoot--a fair shoot! Stand aside, Arnaud, lest you find a bolt  through your gizzard.
 Now, comrade, I take no flight shot, and I give  you the vantage of watching my shaft.
"    As he spoke he raised his arbalest to his shoulder and was about to pull  the trigger, when a large gray stork flapped heavily into view skimming  over the brow of the hill, and then soaring up into the air to pass the  valley.
 Its shrill and piercing cries drew all eyes upon it, and, as it  came nearer, a dark spot which circled above it resolved itself into a  peregrine falcon, which hovered over its head, poising itself from time  to time, and watching its chance of closing with its clumsy quarry.
  Nearer and nearer came the two birds, all absorbed in their own contest,  the stork wheeling upwards, the hawk still fluttering above it, until  they were not a hundred paces from the camp.
 The Brabanter raised his  weapon to the sky, and there came the short, deep twang of his powerful  string.
 His bolt struck the stork just where its wing meets the body,  and the bird whirled aloft in a last convulsive flutter before falling  wounded and flapping to the earth.
 A roar of applause burst from the  crossbowmen; but at the instant that the bolt struck its mark old  Johnston, who had stood listlessly with arrow on string, bent his bow  and sped a shaft through the body of the falcon.
 Whipping the other from  his belt, he sent it skimming some few feet from the earth with so true  an aim that it struck and transfixed the stork for the second time ere  it could reach the ground.
 A deep-chested shout of delight burst from  the archers at the sight of this double feat, and Aylward, dancing with  joy, threw his arms round the old marksman and embraced him with such  vigor that their mail tunics clanged again.
    "Ah! camarade," he cried, "you shall have a stoup with me for this! What  then, old dog, would not the hawk please thee, but thou must have the  stork as well.
 Oh, to my heart again!"    "It is a pretty piece of yew, and well strung," said Johnston with a  twinkle in his deep-set gray eyes.
 "Even an old broken bowman might find  the clout with a bow like this.
"    "You have done very well," remarked the Brabanter in a surly voice.
  "But it seems to me that you have not yet shown yourself to be a better  marksman than I, for I have struck that at which I aimed, and, by the  three kings! no man can do more.
"    "It would ill beseem me to claim to be a better marksman," answered  Johnston, "for I have heard great things of your skill.
 I did but wish  to show that the long-bow could do that which an arbalest could not do,  for you could not with your moulinet have your string ready to speed  another shaft ere the bird drop to the earth.
"    "In that you have vantage," said the crossbowman.
 "By Saint James! it  is now my turn to show you where my weapon has the better of you.
 I pray  you to draw a flight shaft with all your strength down the valley, that  we may see the length of your shoot.
"    "That is a very strong prod of yours," said Johnston, shaking his  grizzled head as he glanced at the thick arch and powerful strings of  his rival's arbalest.
 "I have little doubt that you can overshoot me,  and yet I have seen bowmen who could send a cloth-yard arrow further  than you could speed a quarrel.
"    "So I have heard," remarked the Brabanter; "and yet it is a strange  thing that these wondrous bowmen are never where I chance to be.
 Pace  out the distances with a wand at every five score, and do you, Arnaud,  stand at the fifth wand to carry back my bolts to me.
"    A line was measured down the valley, and Johnston, drawing an arrow to  the very head, sent it whistling over the row of wands.
    "Bravely drawn! A rare shoot!" shouted the bystanders.
    "It is well up to the fourth mark.
"    "By my hilt! it is over it," cried Aylward.
 "I can see where they have  stooped to gather up the shaft.
"    "We shall hear anon," said Johnston quietly, and presently a young  archer came running to say that the arrow had fallen twenty paces beyond  the fourth wand.
    "Four hundred paces and a score," cried Black Simon.
 "I' faith, it is a  very long flight.
 Yet wood and steel may do more than flesh and blood.
"    The Brabanter stepped forward with a smile of conscious triumph, and  loosed the cord of his weapon.
 A shout burst from his comrades as they  watched the swift and lofty flight of the heavy bolt.
    "Over the fourth!" groaned Aylward.
 "By my hilt! I think that it is well  up to the fifth.
"    "It is over the fifth!" cried a Gascon loudly, and a comrade came  running with waving arms to say that the bolt had pitched eight paces  beyond the mark of the five hundred.
    "Which weapon hath the vantage now?" cried the Brabanter, strutting  proudly about with shouldered arbalest, amid the applause of his  companions.
    "You can overshoot me," said Johnston gently.
    "Or any other man who ever bent a long-bow," cried his victorious  adversary.
    "Nay, not so fast," said a huge archer, whose mighty shoulders and red  head towered high above the throng of his comrades.
 "I must have a word  with you ere you crow so loudly.
 Where is my little popper? By sainted  Dick of Hampole! it will be a strange thing if I cannot outshoot that  thing of thine, which to my eyes is more like a rat-trap than a bow.
  Will you try another flight, or do you stand by your last?"    "Five hundred and eight paces will serve my turn," answered the  Brabanter, looking askance at this new opponent.
    "Tut, John," whispered Aylward, "you never were a marksman.
 Why must you  thrust your spoon into this dish?"    "Easy and slow, Aylward.
 There are very many things which I cannot do,  but there are also one or two which I have the trick of.
 It is in my  mind that I can beat this shoot, if my bow will but hold together.
"    "Go on, old babe of the woods!" "Have at it, Hampshire!" cried the  archers laughing.
    "By my soul! you may grin," cried John.
 "But I learned how to make the  long shoot from old Hob Miller of Milford.
" He took up a great black  bow, as he spoke, and sitting down upon the ground he placed his two  feet on either end of the stave.
 With an arrow fitted, he then pulled  the string towards him with both hands until the head of the shaft was  level with the wood.
 The great bow creaked and groaned and the cord  vibrated with the tension.
    "Who is this fool's-head who stands in the way of my shoot?" said he,  craning up his neck from the ground.
    "He stands on the further side of my mark," answered the Brabanter, "so  he has little to fear from you.
"    "Well, the saints assoil him!" cried John.
 "Though I think he is  over-near to be scathed.
" As he spoke he raised his two feet, with the  bow-stave upon their soles, and his cord twanged with a deep rich hum  which might be heard across the valley.
 The measurer in the distance  fell flat upon his face, and then jumping up again, he began to run in  the opposite direction.
    "Well shot, old lad! It is indeed over his head," cried the bowmen.
    "Mon Dieu!" exclaimed the Brabanter, "who ever saw such a shoot?"    "It is but a trick," quoth John.
 "Many a time have I won a gallon of ale  by covering a mile in three flights down Wilverley Chase.
"    "It fell a hundred and thirty paces beyond the fifth mark," shouted an  archer in the distance.
    "Six hundred and thirty paces! Mon Dieu! but that is a shoot! And yet it  says nothing for your weapon, mon gros camarade, for it was by turning  yourself into a crossbow that you did it.
"    "By my hilt! there is truth in that," cried Aylward.
 "And now, friend,  I will myself show you a vantage of the long-bow.
 I pray you to speed  a bolt against yonder shield with all your force.
 It is an inch of elm  with bull's hide over it.
"    "I scarce shot as many shafts at Brignais," growled the man of Brabant;  "though I found a better mark there than a cantle of bull's hide.
 But  what is this, Englishman? The shield hangs not one hundred paces from  me, and a blind man could strike it.
" He screwed up his string to the  furthest pitch, and shot his quarrel at the dangling shield.
 Aylward,  who had drawn an arrow from his quiver, carefully greased the head of  it, and sped it at the same mark.
    "Run, Wilkins," quoth he, "and fetch me the shield.
"    Long were the faces of the Englishmen and broad the laugh of the  crossbowmen as the heavy mantlet was carried towards them, for there in  the centre was the thick Brabant bolt driven deeply into the wood, while  there was neither sign nor trace of the cloth-yard shaft.
    "By the three kings!" cried the Brabanter, "this time at least there is  no gainsaying which is the better weapon, or which the truer hand that  held it.
 You have missed the shield, Englishman.
"    "Tarry a bit! tarry a bit, mon gar.
!" quoth Aylward, and turning round  the shield he showed a round clear hole in the wood at the back of it.
  "My shaft has passed through it, camarade, and I trow the one which goes  through is more to be feared than that which bides on the way.
"    The Brabanter stamped his foot with mortification, and was about to make  some angry reply, when Alleyne Edricson came riding up to the crowds of  archers.
    "Sir Nigel will be here anon," said he, "and it is his wish to speak  with the Company.
"    In an instant order and method took the place of general confusion.
  Bows, steel caps, and jacks were caught up from the grass.
 A long cordon  cleared the camp of all strangers, while the main body fell into four  lines with under-officers and file-leaders in front and on either flank.
  So they stood, silent and motionless, when their leader came riding  towards them, his face shining and his whole small figure swelling with  the news which he bore.
    "Great honor has been done to us, men," cried he: "for, of all the army,  the prince has chosen us out that we should ride onwards into the lands  of Spain to spy upon our enemies.
 Yet, as there are many of us, and as  the service may not be to the liking of all, I pray that those will step  forward from the ranks who have the will to follow me.
"    There was a rustle among the bowmen, but when Sir Nigel looked up at  them no man stood forward from his fellows, but the four lines of men  stretched unbroken as before.
 Sir Nigel blinked at them in amazement,  and a look of the deepest sorrow shadowed his face.
    "That I should live to see the day!" he cried.
 "What! not one----"    "My fair lord," whispered Alleyne, "they have all stepped forward.
"    "Ah, by Saint Paul! I see how it is with them.
 I could not think that  they would desert me.
 We start at dawn to-morrow, and ye are to have  the horses of Sir Robert Cheney's company.
 Be ready, I pray ye, at early  cock-crow.
"    A buzz of delight burst from the archers, as they broke their ranks and  ran hither and thither, whooping and cheering like boys who have news of  a holiday.
 Sir Nigel gazed after them with a smiling face, when a heavy  hand fell upon his shoulder.
    "What ho! my knight-errant of Twynham!" said a voice, "You are off to  Ebro, I hear; and, by the holy fish of Tobias! you must take me under  your banner.
"    "What! Sir Oliver Buttesthorn!" cried Sir Nigel.
 "I had heard that you  were come into camp, and had hoped to see you.
 Glad and proud shall I be  to have you with me.
"    "I have a most particular and weighty reason for wishing to go," said  the sturdy knight.
    "I can well believe it," returned Sir Nigel; "I have met no man who is  quicker to follow where honor leads.
"    "Nay, it is not for honor that I go, Nigel.
"    "For what then?"    "For pullets.
"    "Pullets?"    "Yes, for the rascal vanguard have cleared every hen from the  country-side.
 It was this very morning that Norbury, my squire,  lamed his horse in riding round in quest of one, for we have a bag of  truffles, and nought to eat with them.
 Never have I seen such locusts as  this vanguard of ours.
 Not a pullet shall we see until we are in front  of them; so I shall leave my Winchester runagates to the care of the  provost-marshal, and I shall hie south with you, Nigel, with my truffles  at my saddle-bow.
"    "Oliver, Oliver, I know you over-well," said Sir Nigel, shaking his  head, and the two old soldiers rode off together to their pavilion.
        .
 HOW SIR NIGEL HAWKED AT AN EAGLE.
      To the south of Pampeluna in the kingdom of Navarre there stretched  a high table-land, rising into bare, sterile hills, brown or gray in  color, and strewn with huge boulders of granite.
 On the Gascon side of  the great mountains there had been running streams, meadows, forests,  and little nestling villages.
 Here, on the contrary, were nothing but  naked rocks, poor pasture, and savage, stone-strewn wastes.
 Gloomy  defiles or barrancas intersected this wild country with mountain  torrents dashing and foaming between their rugged sides.
 The clatter  of waters, the scream of the eagle, and the howling of wolves the only  sounds which broke upon the silence in that dreary and inhospitable  region.
    Through this wild country it was that Sir Nigel and his Company pushed  their way, riding at times through vast defiles where the brown, gnarled  cliffs shot up on either side of them, and the sky was but a long  winding blue slit between the clustering lines of box which fringed the  lips of the precipices; or, again leading their horses along the narrow  and rocky paths worn by the muleteers upon the edges of the chasm, where  under their very elbows they could see the white streak which marked  the _gave_ which foamed a thousand feet below them.
 So for two days they  pushed their way through the wild places of Navarre, past Fuente,  over the rapid Ega, through Estella, until upon a winter's evening the  mountains fell away from in front of them, and they saw the broad blue  Ebro curving betwixt its double line of homesteads and of villages.
 The  fishers of Viana were aroused that night by rough voices speaking in a  strange tongue, and ere morning Sir Nigel and his men had ferried the  river and were safe upon the land of Spain.
    All the next day they lay in a pine wood near to the town of Logrono,  resting their horses and taking counsel as to what they should do.
 Sir  Nigel had with him Sir William Felton, Sir Oliver Buttesthorn, stout old  Sir Simon Burley, the Scotch knight-errant, the Earl of Angus, and Sir  Richard Causton, all accounted among the bravest knights in the army,  together with sixty veteran men-at-arms, and three hundred and twenty  archers.
 Spies had been sent out in the morning, and returned after  nightfall to say that the King of Spain was encamped some fourteen miles  off in the direction of Burgos, having with him twenty thousand horse  and forty-five thousand foot.
    A dry-wood fire had been lit, and round this the leaders crouched, the  glare beating upon their rugged faces, while the hardy archers lounged  and chatted amid the tethered horses, while they munched their scanty  provisions.
    "For my part," said Sir Simon Burley, "I am of opinion that we have  already done that which we have come for.
 For do we not now know where  the king is, and how great a following he hath, which was the end of our  journey.
"    "True," answered Sir William Felton, "but I have come on this venture  because it is a long time since I have broken a spear in war, and,  certes, I shall not go back until I have run a course with some cavalier  of Spain.
 Let those go back who will, but I must see more of these  Spaniards ere I turn.
"    "I will not leave you, Sir William," returned Sir Simon Burley; "and  yet, as an old soldier and one who hath seen much of war, I cannot but  think that it is an ill thing for four hundred men to find themselves  between an army of sixty thousand on the one side and a broad river on  the other.
"    "Yet," said Sir Richard Causton, "we cannot for the honor of England go  back without a blow struck.
"    "Nor for the honor of Scotland either," cried the Earl of Angus.
 "By  Saint Andrew! I wish that I may never set eyes upon the water of  Leith again, if I pluck my horse's bridle ere I have seen this camp of  theirs.
"    "By Saint Paul! you have spoken very well," said Sir Nigel, "and I have  always heard that there were very worthy gentlemen among the Scots, and  fine skirmishing to be had upon their border.
 Bethink you, Sir Simon,  that we have this news from the lips of common spies, who can scarce  tell us as much of the enemy and of his forces as the prince would wish  to hear.
"    "You are the leader in this venture, Sir Nigel," the other answered,  "and I do but ride under your banner.
"    "Yet I would fain have your rede and counsel, Sir Simon.
 But, touching  what you say of the river, we can take heed that we shall not have it  at the back of us, for the prince hath now advanced to Salvatierra, and  thence to Vittoria, so that if we come upon their camp from the further  side we can make good our retreat.
"    "What then would you propose?" asked Sir Simon, shaking his grizzled  head as one who is but half convinced.
    "That we ride forward ere the news reach them that we have crossed the  river.
 In this way we may have sight of their army, and perchance even  find occasion for some small deed against them.
"    "So be it, then," said Sir Simon Burley; and the rest of the council  having approved, a scanty meal was hurriedly snatched, and the advance  resumed under the cover of the darkness.
 All night they led their  horses, stumbling and groping through wild defiles and rugged valleys,  following the guidance of a frightened peasant who was strapped by the  wrist to Black Simon's stirrup-leather.
 With the early dawn they found  themselves in a black ravine, with others sloping away from it on either  side, and the bare brown crags rising in long bleak terraces all round  them.
    "If it please you, fair lord," said Black Simon, "this man hath misled  us, and since there is no tree upon which we may hang him, it might be  well to hurl him over yonder cliff.
"    The peasant, reading the soldier's meaning in his fierce eyes and harsh  accents dropped upon his knees, screaming loudly for mercy.
    "How comes it, dog?" asked Sir William Felton in Spanish.
 "Where is this  camp to which you swore that you would lead us?"    "By the sweet Virgin! By the blessed Mother of God!" cried the trembling  peasant, "I swear to you that in the darkness I have myself lost the  path.
"    "Over the cliff with him!" shouted half a dozen voices; but ere the  archers could drag him from the rocks to which he clung Sir Nigel had  ridden up and called upon them to stop.
    "How is this, sirs?" said he.
 "As long as the prince doth me the honor  to entrust this venture to me, it is for me only to give orders; and,  by Saint Paul! I shall be right blithe to go very deeply into the  matter with any one to whom my words may give offence.
 How say you, Sir  William? Or you, my Lord of Angus? Or you, Sir Richard?"    "Nay, nay, Nigel!" cried Sir William.
 "This base peasant is too small  a matter for old comrades to quarrel over.
 But he hath betrayed us, and  certes he hath merited a dog's death.
"    "Hark ye, fellow," said Sir Nigel.
 "We give you one more chance to  find the path.
 We are about to gain much honor, Sir William, in this  enterprise, and it would be a sorry thing if the first blood shed were  that of an unworthy boor.
 Let us say our morning orisons, and it may  chance that ere we finish he may strike upon the track.
"    With bowed heads and steel caps in hand, the archers stood at their  horse's heads, while Sir Simon Burley repeated the Pater, the Ave, and  the Credo.
 Long did Alleyne bear the scene in mind--the knot of knights  in their dull leaden-hued armor, the ruddy visage of Sir Oliver, the  craggy features of the Scottish earl, the shining scalp of Sir Nigel,  with the dense ring of hard, bearded faces and the long brown heads of  the horses, all topped and circled by the beetling cliffs.
 Scarce had  the last deep "amen" broken from the Company, when, in an instant, there  rose the scream of a hundred bugles, with the deep rolling of drums and  the clashing of cymbals, all sounding together in one deafening uproar.
  Knights and archers sprang to arms, convinced that some great host was  upon them; but the guide dropped upon his knees and thanked Heaven for  its mercies.
    "We have found them, caballeros!" he cried.
 "This is their morning call.
  If ye will but deign to follow me, I will set them before you ere a man  might tell his beads.
"    As he spoke he scrambled down one of the narrow ravines, and, climbing  over a low ridge at the further end, he led them into a short valley  with a stream purling down the centre of it and a very thick growth of  elder and of box upon either side.
 Pushing their way through the dense  brushwood, they looked out upon a scene which made their hearts beat  harder and their breath come faster.
    In front of them there lay a broad plain, watered by two winding streams  and covered with grass, stretching away to where, in the furthest  distance, the towers of Burgos bristled up against the light blue  morning sky.
 Over all this vast meadow there lay a great city of  tents--thousands upon thousands of them, laid out in streets and in  squares like a well-ordered town.
 High silken pavilions or colored  marquees, shooting up from among the crowd of meaner dwellings, marked  where the great lords and barons of Leon and Castile displayed their  standards, while over the white roofs, as far as eye could reach, the  waving of ancients, pavons, pensils, and banderoles, with flash of gold  and glow of colors, proclaimed that all the chivalry of Iberia were  mustered in the plain beneath them.
 Far off, in the centre of the camp,  a huge palace of red and white silk, with the royal arms of Castile  waiving from the summit, announced that the gallant Henry lay there in  the midst of his warriors.
    As the English adventurers, peeping out from behind their brushwood  screen, looked down upon this wondrous sight they could see that the  vast army in front of them was already afoot.
 The first pink light of  the rising sun glittered upon the steel caps and breastplates of dense  masses of slingers and of crossbowmen, who drilled and marched in the  spaces which had been left for their exercise.
 A thousand columns of  smoke reeked up into the pure morning air where the faggots were piled  and the camp-kettles already simmering.
  In the open plain clouds of  light horse galloped and swooped with swaying bodies and waving  javelins, after the fashion which the Spanish had adopted from their  Moorish enemies.
 All along by the sedgy banks of the rivers long lines  of pages led their masters' chargers down to water, while the knights  themselves lounged in gayly-dressed groups about the doors of their  pavilions, or rode out, with their falcons upon their wrists and their  greyhounds behind them, in quest of quail or of leveret.
    "By my hilt! mon gar.
!" whispered Aylward to Alleyne, as the young  squire stood with parted lips and wondering eyes, gazing down at the  novel scene before him, "we have been seeking them all night, but now  that we have found them I know not what we are to do with them.
"    "You say sooth, Samkin," quoth old Johnston.
 "I would that we were upon  the far side of Ebro again, for there is neither honor nor profit to be  gained here.
 What say you, Simon?"    "By the rood!" cried the fierce man-at-arms, "I will see the color of  their blood ere I turn my mare's head for the mountains.
 Am I a child,  that I should ride for three days and nought but words at the end of  it?"    "Well said, my sweet honeysuckle!" cried Hordle John.
 "I am with you,  like hilt to blade.
 Could I but lay hands upon one of those gay prancers  yonder, I doubt not that I should have ransom enough from him to buy my  mother a new cow.
"    "A cow!" said Aylward.
 "Say rather ten acres and a homestead on the  banks of Avon.
"    "Say you so? Then, by our Lady! here is for yonder one in the red  jerkin!"    He was about to push recklessly forward into the open, when Sir Nigel  himself darted in front of him, with his hand upon his breast.
    "Back!" said he.
 "Our time is not yet come, and we must lie here until  evening.
 Throw off your jacks and headpieces, least their eyes catch the  shine, and tether the horses among the rocks.
"    The order was swiftly obeyed, and in ten minutes the archers were  stretched along by the side of the brook, munching the bread and the  bacon which they had brought in their bags, and craning their necks to  watch the ever-changing scene beneath them.
 Very quiet and still they  lay, save for a muttered jest or whispered order, for twice during the  long morning they heard bugle-calls from amid the hills on either side  of them, which showed that they had thrust themselves in between the  outposts of the enemy.
 The leaders sat amongst the box-wood, and took  counsel together as to what they should do; while from below there  surged up the buzz of voices, the shouting, the neighing of horses, and  all the uproar of a great camp.
    "What boots it to wait?" said Sir William Felton.
 "Let us ride down upon  their camp ere they discover us.
"    "And so say I," cried the Scottish earl; "for they do not know that  there is any enemy within thirty long leagues of them.
"    "For my part," said Sir Simon Burley, "I think that it is madness, for  you cannot hope to rout this great army; and where are you to go and  what are you to do when they have turned upon you? How say you, Sir  Oliver Buttesthorn?"    "By the apple of Eve!" cried the fat knight, "it appears to me that  this wind brings a very savory smell of garlic and of onions from their  cooking-kettles.
 I am in favor of riding down upon them at once, if my  old friend and comrade here is of the same mind.
"    "Nay," said Sir Nigel, "I have a plan by which we may attempt some small  deed upon them, and yet, by the help of God, may be able to draw off  again; which, as Sir Simon Burley hath said, would be scarce possible in  any other way.
"    "How then, Sir Nigel?" asked several voices.
    "We shall lie here all day; for amid this brushwood it is ill for them  to see us.
 Then when evening comes we shall sally out upon them and see  if we may not gain some honorable advancement from them.
"    "But why then rather than now?"    "Because we shall have nightfall to cover us when we draw off, so that  we may make our way back through the mountains.
 I would station a score  of archers here in the pass, with all our pennons jutting forth from the  rocks, and as many nakirs and drums and bugles as we have with us, so  that those who follow us in the fading light may think that the whole  army of the prince is upon them, and fear to go further.
 What think you  of my plan, Sir Simon?"    "By my troth! I think very well of it," cried the prudent old commander.
  "If four hundred men must needs run a tilt against sixty thousand, I  cannot see how they can do it better or more safely.
"    "And so say I," cried Felton, heartily.
 "But I wish the day were over,  for it will be an ill thing for us if they chance to light upon us.
"    The words were scarce out of his mouth when there came a clatter of  loose stones, the sharp clink of trotting hoofs, and a dark-faced  cavalier, mounted upon a white horse, burst through the bushes and rode  swiftly down the valley from the end which was farthest from the Spanish  camp.
 Lightly armed, with his vizor open and a hawk perched upon his  left wrist, he looked about him with the careless air of a man who is  bent wholly upon pleasure, and unconscious of the possibility of danger.
  Suddenly, however, his eyes lit upon the fierce faces which glared out  at him from the brushwood.
 With a cry of terror, he thrust his spurs  into his horse's sides and dashed for the narrow opening of the gorge.
  For a moment it seemed as though he would have reached it, for he had  trampled over or dashed aside the archers who threw themselves in his  way; but Hordle John seized him by the foot in his grasp of iron and  dragged him from the saddle, while two others caught the frightened  horse.
    "Ho, ho!" roared the great archer.
 "How many cows wilt buy my mother, if  I set thee free?"    "Hush that bull's bellowing!" cried Sir Nigel impatiently.
 "Bring the  man here.
 By St.
 Paul! it is not the first time that we have met; for,  if I mistake not, it is Don Diego Alvarez, who was once at the prince's  court.
"    "It is indeed I," said the Spanish knight, speaking in the French  tongue, "and I pray you to pass your sword through my heart, for how can  I live--I, a caballero of Castile--after being dragged from my horse by  the base hands of a common archer?"    "Fret not for that," answered Sir Nigel.
 "For, in sooth, had he not  pulled you down, a dozen cloth-yard shafts had crossed each other in  your body.
"    "By St.
 James! it were better so than to be polluted by his touch,"  answered the Spaniard, with his black eyes sparkling with rage and  hatred.
 "I trust that I am now the prisoner of some honorable knight or  gentleman.
"    "You are the prisoner of the man who took you, Sir Diego," answered Sir  Nigel.
 "And I may tell you that better men than either you or I have  found themselves before now prisoners in the hands of archers of  England.
"    "What ransom, then, does he demand?" asked the Spaniard.
    Big John scratched his red head and grinned in high delight when the  question was propounded to him.
 "Tell him," said he, "that I shall have  ten cows and a bull too, if it be but a little one.
 Also a dress of  blue sendall for mother and a red one for Joan; with five acres of  pasture-land, two scythes, and a fine new grindstone.
 Likewise a small  house, with stalls for the cows, and thirty-six gallons of beer for the  thirsty weather.
"    "Tut, tut!" cried Sir Nigel, laughing.
 "All these things may be had for  money; and I think, Don Diego, that five thousand crowns is not too much  for so renowned a knight.
"    "It shall be duly paid him.
"    "For some days we must keep you with us; and I must crave leave also to  use your shield, your armor, and your horse.
"    "My harness is yours by the law of arms," said the Spaniard, gloomily.
    "I do but ask the loan of it.
 I have need of it this day, but it shall  be duly returned to you.
 Set guards, Aylward, with arrow on string, at  either end of the pass; for it may happen that some other cavaliers may  visit us ere the time be come.
" All day the little band of Englishmen  lay in the sheltered gorge, looking down upon the vast host of their  unconscious enemies.
 Shortly after mid-day, a great uproar of shouting  and cheering broke out in the camp, with mustering of men and calling of  bugles.
 Clambering up among the rocks, the companions saw a long rolling  cloud of dust along the whole eastern sky-line, with the glint of spears  and the flutter of pennons, which announced the approach of a large body  of cavalry.
 For a moment a wild hope came upon them that perhaps the  prince had moved more swiftly than had been planned, that he had crossed  the Ebro, and that this was his vanguard sweeping to the attack.
    "Surely I see the red pile of Chandos at the head of yonder squadron!"  cried Sir Richard Causton, shading his eyes with his hand.
    "Not so," answered Sir Simon Burley, who had watched the approaching  host with a darkening face.
 "It is even as I feared.
 That is the double  eagle of Du Guesclin.
"    "You say very truly," cried the Earl of Angus.
 "These are the levies of  France, for I can see the ensigns of the Marshal d'Andreghen, with  that of the Lord of Antoing and of Briseuil, and of many another from  Brittany and Anjou.
"    "By St.
 Paul! I am very glad of it," said Sir Nigel.
 "Of these Spaniards  I know nothing; but the French are very worthy gentlemen, and will do  what they can for our advancement.
"    "There are at the least four thousand of them, and all men-at-arms,"  cried Sir William Felton.
 "See, there is Bertrand himself, beside his  banner, and there is King Henry, who rides to welcome him.
 Now they all  turn and come into the camp together.
"    As he spoke, the vast throng of Spaniards and of Frenchmen trooped  across the plain, with brandished arms and tossing banners.
 All day long  the sound of revelry and of rejoicing from the crowded camp swelled up  to the ears of the Englishmen, and they could see the soldiers of the  two nations throwing themselves into each other's arms and dancing  hand-in-hand round the blazing fires.
 The sun had sunk behind a  cloud-bank in the west before Sir Nigel at last gave word that the men  should resume their arms and have their horses ready.
 He had himself  thrown off his armor, and had dressed himself from head to foot in the  harness of the captured Spaniard.
    "Sir William," said he, "it is my intention to attempt a small deed, and  I ask you therefore that you will lead this outfall upon the camp.
 For  me, I will ride into their camp with my squire and two archers.
 I pray  you to watch me, and to ride forth when I am come among the tents.
 You  will leave twenty men behind here, as we planned this morning, and you  will ride back here after you have ventured as far as seems good to  you.
"    "I will do as you order, Nigel; but what is it that you propose to do?"    "You will see anon, and indeed it is but a trifling matter.
 Alleyne, you  will come with me, and lead a spare horse by the bridle.
 I will have the  two archers who rode with us through France, for they are trusty men and  of stout heart.
 Let them ride behind us, and let them leave their bows  here among the bushes for it is not my wish that they should know that  we are Englishmen.
 Say no word to any whom we may meet, and, if any  speak to you, pass on as though you heard them not.
 Are you ready?"    "I am ready, my fair lord," said Alleyne.
    "And I," "And I," cried Aylward and John.
    "Then the rest I leave to your wisdom, Sir William; and if God sends us  fortune we shall meet you again in this gorge ere it be dark.
"    So saying, Sir Nigel mounted the white horse of the Spanish cavalier,  and rode quietly forth from his concealment with his three companions  behind him, Alleyne leading his master's own steed by the bridle.
 So  many small parties of French and Spanish horse were sweeping hither and  thither that the small band attracted little notice, and making its way  at a gentle trot across the plain, they came as far as the camp without  challenge or hindrance.
 On and on they pushed past the endless lines of  tents, amid the dense swarms of horsemen and of footmen, until the huge  royal pavilion stretched in front of them.
 They were close upon it when  of a sudden there broke out a wild hubbub from a distant portion of the  camp, with screams and war-cries and all the wild tumult of battle.
 At  the sound soldiers came rushing from their tents, knights shouted loudly  for their squires, and there was mad turmoil on every hand of bewildered  men and plunging horses.
 At the royal tent a crowd of gorgeously dressed  servants ran hither and thither in helpless panic for the guard  of soldiers who were stationed there had already ridden off in the  direction of the alarm.
 A man-at-arms on either side of the doorway were  the sole protectors of the royal dwelling.
    "I have come for the king," whispered Sir Nigel; "and, by Saint Paul! he  must back with us or I must bide here.
"    Alleyne and Aylward sprang from their horses, and flew at the two  sentries, who were disarmed and beaten down in an instant by so furious  and unexpected an attack.
 Sir Nigel dashed into the royal tent, and was  followed by Hordle John as soon as the horses had been secured.
 From  within came wild screamings and the clash of steel, and then the two  emerged once more, their swords and forearms reddened with blood,  while John bore over his shoulder the senseless body of a man whose gay  surcoat, adorned with the lions and towers of Castile, proclaimed him  to belong to the royal house.
 A crowd of white-faced sewers and pages  swarmed at their heels, those behind pushing forwards, while the  foremost shrank back from the fierce faces and reeking weapons of the  adventurers.
 The senseless body was thrown across the spare horse, the  four sprang to their saddles, and away they thundered with loose reins  and busy spurs through the swarming camp.
    But confusion and disorder still reigned among the Spaniards for Sir  William Felton and his men had swept through half their camp, leaving  a long litter of the dead and the dying to mark their course.
 Uncertain  who were their attackers, and unable to tell their English enemies  from their newly-arrived Breton allies, the Spanish knights rode wildly  hither and thither in aimless fury.
 The mad turmoil, the mixture of  races, and the fading light, were all in favor of the four who alone  knew their own purpose among the vast uncertain multitude.
 Twice ere  they reached open ground they had to break their way through small  bodies of horses, and once there came a whistle of arrows and singing of  stones about their ears; but, still dashing onwards, they shot out  from among the tents and found their own comrades retreating for the  mountains at no very great distance from them.
 Another five minutes of  wild galloping over the plain, and they were all back in their gorge,  while their pursuers fell back before the rolling of drums and blare of  trumpets, which seemed to proclaim that the whole army of the prince was  about to emerge from the mountain passes.
    "By my soul! Nigel," cried Sir Oliver, waving a great boiled ham over  his head, "I have come by something which I may eat with my truffles! I  had a hard fight for it, for there were three of them with their mouths  open and the knives in their hands, all sitting agape round the table,  when I rushed in upon them.
 How say you, Sir William, will you not try  the smack of the famed Spanish swine, though we have but the brook water  to wash it down?"    "Later, Sir Oliver," answered the old soldier, wiping his grimed face.
  "We must further into the mountains ere we be in safety.
 But what have  we here, Nigel?"    "It is a prisoner whom I have taken, and in sooth, as he came from the  royal tent and wears the royal arms upon his jupon, I trust that he is  the King of Spain.
"    "The King of Spain!" cried the companions, crowding round in amazement.
    "Nay, Sir Nigel," said Felton, peering at the prisoner through the  uncertain light, "I have twice seen Henry of Transtamare, and certes  this man in no way resembles him.
"    "Then, by the light of heaven! I will ride back for him," cried Sir  Nigel.
    "Nay, nay, the camp is in arms, and it would be rank madness.
 Who are  you, fellow?" he added in Spanish, "and how is it that you dare to wear  the arms of Castile?"    The prisoner was bent recovering the consciousness which had been  squeezed from him by the grip of Hordle John.
 "If it please you," he  answered, "I and nine others are the body-squires of the king, and must  ever wear his arms, so as to shield him from even such perils as have  threatened him this night.
 The king is at the tent of the brave Du  Guesclin, where he will sup to night.
 But I am a caballero of Aragon,  Don Sancho Penelosa, and, though I be no king, I am yet ready to pay a  fitting price for my ransom.
"    "By Saint Paul! I will not touch your gold," cried Sir Nigel.
 "Go back  to your master and give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring of Twynham  Castle, telling him that I had hoped to make his better acquaintance  this night, and that, if I have disordered his tent, it was but in my  eagerness to know so famed and courteous a knight.
 Spur on, comrades!  for we must cover many a league ere we can venture to light fire or to  loosen girth.
 I had hoped to ride without this patch to-night, but it  seems that I must carry it yet a little longer.
"        .
 HOW SIR NIGEL TOOK THE PATCH FROM HIS EYE.
      It was a cold, bleak morning in the beginning of March, and the mist was  drifting in dense rolling clouds through the passes of the Cantabrian  mountains.
 The Company, who had passed the night in a sheltered gully,  were already astir, some crowding round the blazing fires and others  romping or leaping over each other's backs for their limbs were chilled  and the air biting.
 Here and there, through the dense haze which  surrounded them, there loomed out huge pinnacles and jutting boulders  of rock: while high above the sea of vapor there towered up one gigantic  peak, with the pink glow of the early sunshine upon its snow-capped  head.
 The ground was wet, the rocks dripping, the grass and ever-greens  sparkling with beads of moisture; yet the camp was loud with laughter  and merriment, for a messenger had ridden in from the prince with words  of heart-stirring praise for what they had done, and with orders that  they should still abide in the forefront of the army.
    Round one of the fires were clustered four or five of the leading men  of the archers, cleaning the rust from their weapons, and glancing  impatiently from time to time at a great pot which smoked over the  blaze.
 There was Aylward squatting cross-legged in his shirt, while he  scrubbed away at his chain-mail brigandine, whistling loudly the while.
  On one side of him sat old Johnston, who was busy in trimming the  feathers of some arrows to his liking; and on the other Hordle John, who  lay with his great limbs all asprawl, and his headpiece balanced upon  his uplifted foot.
 Black Simon of Norwich crouched amid the rocks,  crooning an Eastland ballad to himself, while he whetted his sword upon  a flat stone which lay across his knees; while beside him sat Alleyne  Edricson, and Norbury, the silent squire of Sir Oliver, holding out  their chilled hands towards the crackling faggots.
    "Cast on another culpon, John, and stir the broth with thy  sword-sheath," growled Johnston, looking anxiously for the twentieth  time at the reeking pot.
    "By my hilt!" cried Aylward, "now that John hath come by this great  ransom, he will scarce abide the fare of poor archer lads.
 How say you,  camarade? When you see Hordle once more, there will be no penny ale and  fat bacon, but Gascon wines and baked meats every day of the seven.
"    "I know not about that," said John, kicking his helmet up into the air  and catching it in his hand.
 "I do but know that whether the broth be  ready or no, I am about to dip this into it.
"    "It simmers and it boils," cried Johnston, pushing his hard-lined face  through the smoke.
 In an instant the pot had been plucked from the  blaze, and its contents had been scooped up in half a dozen steel  head-pieces, which were balanced betwixt their owners' knees, while,  with spoon and gobbet of bread, they devoured their morning meal.
    "It is ill weather for bows," remarked John at last, when, with a long  sigh, he drained the last drop from his helmet.
 "My strings are as limp  as a cow's tail this morning.
"    "You should rub them with water glue," quoth Johnston.
 "You remember,  Samkin, that it was wetter than this on the morning of Crecy, and yet I  cannot call to mind that there was aught amiss with our strings.
"    "It is in my thoughts," said Black Simon, still pensively grinding his  sword, "that we may have need of your strings ere sundown.
 I dreamed of  the red cow last night.
"    "And what is this red cow, Simon?" asked Alleyne.
    "I know not, young sir; but I can only say that on the eve of Cadsand,  and on the eve of Crecy, and on the eve of Nogent, I dreamed of a red  cow; and now the dream has come upon me again, so I am now setting a  very keen edge to my blade.
"    "Well said, old war-dog!" cried Aylward.
 "By my hilt! I pray that your  dream may come true, for the prince hath not set us out here to drink  broth or to gather whortle-berries.
 One more fight, and I am ready to  hang up my bow, marry a wife, and take to the fire corner.
 But how now,  Robin? Whom is it that you seek?"    "The Lord Loring craves your attendance in his tent," said a young  archer to Alleyne.
    The squire rose and proceeded to the pavilion, where he found the knight  seated upon a cushion, with his legs crossed in front of him and a broad  ribbon of parchment laid across his knees, over which he was poring with  frowning brows and pursed lips.
    "It came this morning by the prince's messenger," said he, "and was  brought from England by Sir John Fallislee, who is new come from Sussex.
  What make you of this upon the outer side?"    "It is fairly and clearly written," Alleyne answered, "and it signifies  To Sir Nigel Loring, Knight Constable of Twynham Castle, by the hand of  Christopher, the servant of God at the Priory of Christchurch.
"    "So I read it," said Sir Nigel.
 "Now I pray you to read what is set  forth within.
"    Alleyne turned to the letter, and, as his eyes rested upon it, his face  turned pale and a cry of surprise and grief burst from his lips.
    "What then?" asked the knight, peering up at him anxiously.
 "There is  nought amiss with the Lady Mary or with the Lady Maude?"    "It is my brother--my poor unhappy brother!" cried Alleyne, with his  hand to his brow.
 "He is dead.
"    "By Saint Paul! I have never heard that he had shown so much love for  you that you should mourn him so.
"    "Yet he was my brother--the only kith or kin that I had upon earth.
  Mayhap he had cause to be bitter against me, for his land was given to  the abbey for my upbringing.
 Alas! alas! and I raised my staff against  him when last we met! He has been slain--and slain, I fear, amidst crime  and violence.
"    "Ha!" said Sir Nigel.
 "Read on, I pray you.
"    "'God be with thee, my honored lord, and have thee in his holy keeping.
  The Lady Loring hath asked me to set down in writing what hath befallen  at Twynham, and all that concerns the death of thy ill neighbor the  Socman of Minstead.
 For when ye had left us, this evil man gathered  around him all outlaws, villeins, and masterless men, until they were  come to such a force that they slew and scattered the king's men who  went against them.
 Then, coming forth from the woods, they laid siege to  thy castle, and for two days they girt us in and shot hard against us,  with such numbers as were a marvel to see.
 Yet the Lady Loring held the  place stoutly, and on the second day the Socman was slain--by his own  men, as some think--so that we were delivered from their hands; for  which praise be to all the saints, and more especially to the holy  Anselm, upon whose feast it came to pass.
 The Lady Loring, and the Lady  Maude, thy fair daughter, are in good health; and so also am I, save for  an imposthume of the toe-joint, which hath been sent me for my sins.
 May  all the saints preserve thee!'"    "It was the vision of the Lady Tiphaine," said Sir Nigel, after a pause.
  "Marked you not how she said that the leader was one with a yellow  beard, and how he fell before the gate.
 But how came it, Alleyne, that  this woman, to whom all things are as crystal, and who hath not said one  word which has not come to pass, was yet so led astray as to say that  your thoughts turned to Twynham Castle even more than my own?"    "My fair lord," said Alleyne, with a flush on his weather-stained  cheeks, "the Lady Tiphaine may have spoken sooth when she said it; for  Twynham Castle is in my heart by day and in my dreams by night.
"    "Ha!" cried Sir Nigel, with a sidelong glance.
    "Yes, my fair lord; for indeed I love your daughter, the Lady Maude;  and, unworthy as I am, I would give my heart's blood to serve her.
"    "By St.
 Paul! Edricson," said the knight coldly, arching his eyebrows,  "you aim high in this matter.
 Our blood is very old.
"    "And mine also is very old," answered the squire.
    "And the Lady Maude is our single child.
 All our name and lands centre  upon her.
"    "Alas! that I should say it, but I also am now the only Edricson.
"    "And why have I not heard this from you before, Alleyne? In sooth, I  think that you have used me ill.
"    "Nay, my fair lord, say not so; for I know not whether your daughter  loves me, and there is no pledge between us.
"    Sir Nigel pondered for a few moments, and then burst out a-laughing.
 "By  St.
 Paul!" said he, "I know not why I should mix in the matter; for I  have ever found that the Lady Maud was very well able to  look to her own affairs.
 Since first she could stamp her little foot,  she hath ever been able to get that for which she craved; and if she set  her heart on thee, Alleyne, and thou on her, I do not think that this  Spanish king, with his three-score thousand men, could hold you apart.
  Yet this I will say, that I would see you a full knight ere you go to my  daughter with words of love.
 I have ever said that a brave lance should  wed her; and, by my soul! Edricson, if God spare you, I think that you  will acquit yourself well.
 But enough of such trifles, for we have our  work before us, and it will be time to speak of this matter when we see  the white cliffs of England once more.
 Go to Sir William Felton, I pray  you, and ask him to come hither, for it is time that we were marching.
  There is no pass at the further end of the valley, and it is a perilous  place should an enemy come upon us.
"    Alleyne delivered his message, and then wandered forth from the camp,  for his mind was all in a whirl with this unexpected news, and with his  talk with Sir Nigel.
 Sitting upon a rock, with his burning brow resting  upon his hands, he thought of his brother, of their quarrel, of the Lady  Maude in her bedraggled riding-dress, of the gray old castle, of the  proud pale face in the armory, and of the last fiery words with which  she had sped him on his way.
 Then he was but a penniless, monk-bred lad,  unknown and unfriended.
 Now he was himself Socman of Minstead, the head  of an old stock, and the lord of an estate which, if reduced from its  former size, was still ample to preserve the dignity of his family.
  Further, he had become a man of experience, was counted brave among  brave men, had won the esteem and confidence of her father, and, above  all, had been listened to by him when he told him the secret of his  love.
 As to the gaining of knighthood, in such stirring times it was no  great matter for a brave squire of gentle birth to aspire to that honor.
  He would leave his bones among these Spanish ravines, or he would do  some deed which would call the eyes of men upon him.
    Alleyne was still seated on the rock, his griefs and his joys drifting  swiftly over his mind like the shadow of clouds upon a sunlit meadow,  when of a sudden he became conscious of a low, deep sound which came  booming up to him through the fog.
 Close behind him he could hear the  murmur of the bowmen, the occasional bursts of hoarse laughter, and the  champing and stamping of their horses.
 Behind it all, however, came that  low-pitched, deep-toned hum, which seemed to come from every quarter and  to fill the whole air.
 In the old monastic days he remembered to  have heard such a sound when he had walked out one windy night at  Bucklershard, and had listened to the long waves breaking upon the  shingly shore.
 Here, however, was neither wind nor sea, and yet the dull  murmur rose ever louder and stronger out of the heart of the rolling sea  of vapor.
 He turned and ran to the camp, shouting an alarm at the top of  his voice.
    It was but a hundred paces, and yet ere he had crossed it every bowman  was ready at his horse's head, and the group of knights were out and  listening intently to the ominous sound.
    "It is a great body of horse," said Sir William Felton, "and they are  riding very swiftly hitherwards.
"    "Yet they must be from the prince's army," remarked Sir Richard Causton,  "for they come from the north.
"    "Nay," said the Earl of Angus, "it is not so certain; for the peasant  with whom we spoke last night said that it was rumored that Don Tello,  the Spanish king's brother, had ridden with six thousand chosen men to  beat up the prince's camp.
 It may be that on their backward road they  have come this way.
"    "By St.
 Paul!" cried Sir Nigel, "I think that it is even as you say, for  that same peasant had a sour face and a shifting eye, as one who bore us  little good will.
 I doubt not that he has brought these cavaliers upon  us.
"    "But the mist covers us," said Sir Simon Burley.
 "We have yet time to  ride through the further end of the pass.
"    "Were we a troop of mountain goats we might do so," answered Sir William  Felton, "but it is not to be passed by a company of horsemen.
 If these  be indeed Don Tello and his men, then we must bide where we are, and do  what we can to make them rue the day that they found us in their path.
"    "Well spoken, William!" cried Sir Nigel, in high delight.
 "If there be  so many as has been said, then there will be much honor to be gained  from them and every hope of advancement.
 But the sound has ceased, and I  fear that they have gone some other way.
"    "Or mayhap they have come to the mouth of the gorge, and are marshalling  their ranks.
 Hush and hearken! for they are no great way from us.
"    The Company stood peering into the dense fog-wreath, amidst a silence so  profound that the dripping of the water from the rocks and the breathing  of the horses grew loud upon the ear.
 Suddenly from out the sea of mist  came the shrill sound of a neigh, followed by a long blast upon a bugle.
    "It is a Spanish call, my fair lord," said Black Simon.
 "It is used by  their prickers and huntsmen when the beast hath not fled, but is still  in its lair.
"    "By my faith!" said Sir Nigel, smiling, "if they are in a humor for  venerie we may promise them some sport ere they sound the mort over us.
  But there is a hill in the centre of the gorge on which we might take  our stand.
"    "I marked it yester-night," said Felton, "and no better spot could be  found for our purpose, for it is very steep at the back.
 It is but a  bow-shot to the left, and, indeed, I can see the shadow of it.
"    The whole Company, leading their horses, passed across to the small hill  which loomed in front of them out of the mist.
 It was indeed admirably  designed for defence, for it sloped down in front, all jagged and  boulder-strewn, while it fell away in a sheer cliff of a hundred feet or  more.
 On the summit was a small uneven plateau, with a stretch across of  a hundred paces, and a depth of half as much again.
    "Unloose the horses!" said Sir Nigel.
 "We have no space for them, and if  we hold our own we shall have horses and to spare when this day's work  is done.
 Nay, keep yours, my fair sirs, for we may have work for them.
  Aylward, Johnston, let your men form a harrow on either side of the  ridge.
 Sir Oliver and you, my Lord Angus, I give you the right wing, and  the left to you, Sir Simon, and to you, Sir Richard Causton.
 I and Sir  William Felton will hold the centre with our men-at-arms.
 Now order  the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God's and our  bodies the king's, and our swords for Saint George and for England!"    Sir Nigel had scarcely spoken when the mist seemed to thin in the  valley, and to shred away into long ragged clouds which trailed from  the edges of the cliffs.
 The gorge in which they had camped was a mere  wedge-shaped cleft among the hills, three-quarters of a mile deep, with  the small rugged rising upon which they stood at the further end, and  the brown crags walling it in on three sides.
 As the mist parted, and  the sun broke through, it gleamed and shimmered with dazzling brightness  upon the armor and headpieces of a vast body of horsemen who stretched  across the barranca from one cliff to the other, and extended backwards  until their rear guard were far out upon the plain beyond.
 Line after  line, and rank after rank, they choked the neck of the valley with  a long vista of tossing pennons, twinkling lances, waving plumes and  streaming banderoles, while the curvets and gambades of the chargers  lent a constant motion and shimmer to the glittering, many-colored mass.
  A yell of exultation, and a forest of waving steel through the length  and breadth of their column, announced that they could at last see their  entrapped enemies, while the swelling notes of a hundred bugles and  drums, mixed with the clash of Moorish cymbals, broke forth into a proud  peal of martial triumph.
 Strange it was to these gallant and sparkling  cavaliers of Spain to look upon this handful of men upon the hill, the  thin lines of bowmen, the knots of knights and men-at-arms with armor  rusted and discolored from long service, and to learn that these were  indeed the soldiers whose fame and prowess had been the camp-fire talk  of every army in Christendom.
 Very still and silent they stood, leaning  upon their bows, while their leaders took counsel together in front of  them.
 No clang of bugle rose from their stern ranks, but in the centre  waved the leopards of England, on the right the ensign of their Company  with the roses of Loring, and on the left, over three score of Welsh  bowmen, there floated the red banner of Merlin with the boars'-heads of  the Buttesthorns.
 Gravely and sedately they stood beneath the morning  sun waiting for the onslaught of their foemen.
    "By Saint Paul!" said Sir Nigel, gazing with puckered eye down the  valley, "there appear to be some very worthy people among them.
 What is  this golden banner which waves upon the left?"    "It is the ensign of the Knights of Calatrava," answered Felton.
    "And the other upon the right?"    "It marks the Knights of Santiago, and I see by his flag that their  grand-master rides at their head.
 There too is the banner of Castile  amid yonder sparkling squadron which heads the main battle.
 There are  six thousand men-at-arms with ten squadrons of slingers as far as I may  judge their numbers.
"    "There are Frenchmen among them, my fair lord," remarked Black Simon.
  "I can see the pennons of De Couvette, De Brieux, Saint Pol, and many  others who struck in against us for Charles of Blois.
"    "You are right," said Sir William, "for I can also see them.
 There is  much Spanish blazonry also, if I could but read it.
 Don Diego, you know  the arms of your own land.
 Who are they who have done us this honor?"    The Spanish prisoner looked with exultant eyes upon the deep and serried  ranks of his countrymen.
    "By Saint James!" said he, "if ye fall this day ye fall by no mean  hands, for the flower of the knighthood of Castile ride under the banner  of Don Tello, with the chivalry of Asturias, Toledo, Leon, Cordova,  Galicia, and Seville.
 I see the guidons of Albornez, Cacorla, Rodriguez,  Tavora, with the two great orders, and the knights of France and of  Aragon.
 If you will take my rede you will come to a composition with  them, for they will give you such terms as you have given me.
"    "Nay, by Saint Paul! it were pity if so many brave men were drawn  together, and no little deed of arms to come of it.
 Ha! William, they  advance upon us; and, by my soul! it is a sight that is worth coming  over the seas to see.
"    As he spoke, the two wings of the Spanish host, consisting of the  Knights of Calatrava on the one side and of Santiago upon the other,  came swooping swiftly down the valley, while the main body followed more  slowly behind.
 Five hundred paces from the English the two great bodies  of horse crossed each other, and, sweeping round in a curve, retired  in feigned confusion towards their centre.
 Often in bygone wars had the  Moors tempted the hot-blooded Spaniards from their places of strength by  such pretended flights, but there were men upon the hill to whom every  ruse and trick of war were as their daily trade and practice.
 Again and  even nearer came the rallying Spaniards, and again with cry of fear  and stooping bodies they swerved off to right and left, but the English  still stood stolid and observant among their rocks.
 The vanguard halted  a long bow shot from the hill, and with waving spears and vaunting  shouts challenged their enemies to come forth, while two cavaliers,  pricking forward from the glittering ranks, walked their horses slowly  between the two arrays with targets braced and lances in rest like the  challengers in a tourney.
    "By Saint Paul!" cried Sir Nigel, with his one eye glowing like an  ember, "these appear to be two very worthy and debonair gentlemen.
 I do  not call to mind when I have seen any people who seemed of so great a  heart and so high of enterprise.
 We have our horses, Sir William: shall  we not relieve them of any vow which they may have upon their souls?"    Felton's reply was to bound upon his charger, and to urge it down the  slope, while Sir Nigel followed not three spears'-lengths behind him.
  It was a rugged course, rocky and uneven, yet the two knights, choosing  their men, dashed onwards at the top of their speed, while the gallant  Spaniards flew as swiftly to meet them.
 The one to whom Felton found  himself opposed was a tall stripling with a stag's head upon his shield,  while Sir Nigel's man was broad and squat with plain steel harness, and  a pink and white torse bound round his helmet.
 The first struck Felton  on the target with such force as to split it from side to side, but Sir  William's lance crashed through the camail which shielded the Spaniard's  throat, and he fell, screaming hoarsely, to the ground.
 Carried away by  the heat and madness of fight, the English knight never drew rein, but  charged straight on into the array of the knights of Calatrava.
 Long  time the silent ranks upon the hill could see a swirl and eddy deep down  in the heart of the Spanish column, with a circle of rearing chargers  and flashing blades.
 Here and there tossed the white plume of the  English helmet, rising and falling like the foam upon a wave, with the  fierce gleam and sparkle ever circling round it until at last it had  sunk from view, and another brave man had turned from war to peace.
    Sir Nigel, meanwhile, had found a foeman worthy of his steel for his  opponent was none other than Sebastian Gomez, the picked lance of  the monkish Knights of Santiago, who had won fame in a hundred bloody  combats with the Moors of Andalusia.
 So fierce was their meeting that  their spears shivered up to the very grasp, and the horses reared  backwards until it seemed that they must crash down upon their riders.
  Yet with consummate horsemanship they both swung round in a long curvet,  and then plucking out their swords they lashed at each other like two  lusty smiths hammering upon an anvil.
 The chargers spun round each  other, biting and striking, while the two blades wheeled and whizzed and  circled in gleams of dazzling light.
 Cut, parry, and thrust followed  so swiftly upon each other that the eye could not follow them, until at  last coming thigh to thigh, they cast their arms around each other  and rolled off their saddles to the ground.
 The heavier Spaniard threw  himself upon his enemy, and pinning him down beneath him raised his  sword to slay him, while a shout of triumph rose from the ranks of his  countrymen.
 But the fatal blow never fell, for even as his arm quivered  before descending, the Spaniard gave a shudder, and stiffening himself  rolled heavily over upon his side, with the blood gushing from his  armpit and from the slit of his vizor.
 Sir Nigel sprang to his feet with  his bloody dagger in his left hand and gazed down upon his adversary,  but that fatal and sudden stab in the vital spot, which the Spaniard had  exposed by raising his arm, had proved instantly mortal.
 The Englishman  leaped upon his horse and made for the hill, at the very instant that a  yell of rage from a thousand voices and the clang of a score of bugles  announced the Spanish onset.
    But the islanders were ready and eager for the encounter.
 With feet  firmly planted, their sleeves rolled back to give free play to their  muscles, their long yellow bow-staves in their left hands, and their  quivers slung to the front, they had waited in the four-deep harrow  formation which gave strength to their array, and yet permitted every  man to draw his arrow freely without harm to those in front.
 Aylward and  Johnston had been engaged in throwing light tufts of grass into the air  to gauge the wind force, and a hoarse whisper passed down the ranks from  the file-leaders to the men, with scraps of advice and admonition.
    "Do not shoot outside the fifteen-score paces," cried Johnston.
 "We may  need all our shafts ere we have done with them.
"    "Better to overshoot than to undershoot," added Aylward.
 "Better to  strike the rear guard than to feather a shaft in the earth.
"    "Loose quick and sharp when they come," added another.
 "Let it be the  eye to the string, the string to the shaft, and the shaft to the mark.
  By Our Lady! their banners advance, and we must hold our ground now if  ever we are to see Southampton Water again.
"    Alleyne, standing with his sword drawn amidst the archers, saw a long  toss and heave of the glittering squadrons.
 Then the front ranks began  to surge slowly forward, to trot, to canter, to gallop, and in an  instant the whole vast array was hurtling onward, line after line, the  air full of the thunder of their cries, the ground shaking with the beat  of their hoofs, the valley choked with the rushing torrent of steel,  topped by the waving plumes, the slanting spears and the fluttering  banderoles.
 On they swept over the level and up to the slope, ere they  met the blinding storm of the English arrows.
 Down went the whole ranks  in a whirl of mad confusion, horses plunging and kicking, bewildered men  falling, rising, staggering on or back, while ever new lines of horsemen  came spurring through the gaps and urged their chargers up the fatal  slope.
 All around him Alleyne could hear the stern, short orders of the  master-bowmen, while the air was filled with the keen twanging of the  strings and the swish and patter of the shafts.
 Right across the foot  of the hill there had sprung up a long wall of struggling horses and  stricken men, which ever grew and heightened as fresh squadrons poured  on the attack.
 One young knight on a gray jennet leaped over his fallen  comrades and galloped swiftly up the hill, shrieking loudly upon Saint  James, ere he fell within a spear-length of the English line, with the  feathers of arrows thrusting out from every crevice and joint of his  armor.
 So for five long minutes the gallant horsemen of Spain and of  France strove ever and again to force a passage, until the wailing  note of a bugle called them back, and they rode slowly out of bow-shot,  leaving their best and their bravest in the ghastly, blood-mottled heap  behind them.
    But there was little rest for the victors.
 Whilst the knights had  charged them in front the slingers had crept round upon either flank and  had gained a footing upon the cliffs and behind the outlying rocks.
  A storm of stones broke suddenly upon the defenders, who, drawn up in  lines upon the exposed summit, offered a fair mark to their hidden  foes.
 Johnston, the old archer, was struck upon the temple and fell dead  without a groan, while fifteen of his bowmen and six of the men-at-arms  were struck down at the same moment.
 The others lay on their faces to  avoid the deadly hail, while at each side of the plateau a fringe of  bowmen exchanged shots with the slingers and crossbowmen among the  rocks, aiming mainly at those who had swarmed up the cliffs, and  bursting into laughter and cheers when a well-aimed shaft brought one of  their opponents toppling down from his lofty perch.
    "I think, Nigel," said Sir Oliver, striding across to the little knight,  "that we should all acquit ourselves better had we our none-meat, for  the sun is high in the heaven.
"    "By Saint Paul!" quoth Sir Nigel, plucking the patch from his eye,  "I think that I am now clear of my vow, for this Spanish knight was a  person from whom much honor might be won.
 Indeed, he was a very worthy  gentleman, of good courage, and great hardiness, and it grieves me that  he should have come by such a hurt.
 As to what you say of food, Oliver,  it is not to be thought of, for we have nothing with us upon the hill.
"    "Nigel!" cried Sir Simon Burley, hurrying up with consternation upon his  face, "Aylward tells me that there are not ten-score arrows left in all  their sheaves.
 See! they are springing from their horses, and cutting  their sollerets that they may rush upon us.
 Might we not even now make a  retreat?"    "My soul will retreat from my body first!" cried the little knight.
  "Here I am, and here I bide, while God gives me strength to lift a  sword.
"    "And so say I!" shouted Sir Oliver, throwing his mace high into the air  and catching it again by the handle.
    "To your arms, men!" roared Sir Nigel.
 "Shoot while you may, and then  out sword, and let us live or die together!"        .
 HOW THE WHITE COMPANY CAME TO BE DISBANDED.
      Then up rose from the hill in the rugged Cantabrian valley a sound such  as had not been heard in those parts before, nor was again, until  the streams which rippled amid the rocks had been frozen by over four  hundred winters and thawed by as many returning springs.
 Deep and full  and strong it thundered down the ravine, the fierce battle-call of a  warrior race, the last stern welcome to whoso should join with them in  that world-old game where the stake is death.
 Thrice it swelled forth  and thrice it sank away, echoing and reverberating amidst the crags.
  Then, with set faces, the Company rose up among the storm of stones,  and looked down upon the thousands who sped swiftly up the slope against  them.
 Horse and spear had been set aside, but on foot, with sword and  battle-axe, their broad shields slung in front of them, the chivalry of  Spain rushed to the attack.
    And now arose a struggle so fell, so long, so evenly sustained,  that even now the memory of it is handed down amongst the Cantabrian  mountaineers and the ill-omened knoll is still pointed out by fathers  to their children as the "Altura de los Inglesos," where the men from  across the sea fought the great fight with the knights of the south.
 The  last arrow was quickly shot, nor could the slingers hurl their stones,  so close were friend and foe.
 From side to side stretched the thin line  of the English, lightly armed and quick-footed, while against it stormed  and raged the pressing throng of fiery Spaniards and of gallant Bretons.
  The clink of crossing sword-blades, the dull thudding of heavy blows,  the panting and gasping of weary and wounded men, all rose together in  a wild, long-drawn note, which swelled upwards to the ears of the  wondering peasants who looked down from the edges of the cliffs upon the  swaying turmoil of the battle beneath them.
 Back and forward reeled the  leopard banner, now borne up the slope by the rush and weight of the  onslaught, now pushing downwards again as Sir Nigel, Burley, and Black  Simon with their veteran men-at arms, flung themselves madly into the  fray.
 Alleyne, at his lord's right hand, found himself swept hither and  thither in the desperate struggle, exchanging savage thrusts one instant  with a Spanish cavalier, and the next torn away by the whirl of men and  dashed up against some new antagonist.
 To the right Sir Oliver, Aylward,  Hordle John, and the bowmen of the Company fought furiously against the  monkish Knights of Santiago, who were led up the hill by their prior--a  great, deep-chested man, who wore a brown monastic habit over his suit  of mail.
 Three archers he slew in three giant strokes, but Sir Oliver  flung his arms round him, and the two, staggering and straining, reeled  backwards and fell, locked in each other's grasp, over the edge of the  steep cliff which flanked the hill.
 In vain his knights stormed and  raved against the thin line which barred their path: the sword of  Aylward and the great axe of John gleamed in the forefront of the battle  and huge jagged pieces of rock, hurled by the strong arms of the bowmen,  crashed and hurtled amid their ranks.
 Slowly they gave back down the  hill, the archers still hanging upon their skirts, with a long litter of  writhing and twisted figures to mark the course which they had taken.
 At  the same instant the Welshmen upon the left, led on by the Scotch earl,  had charged out from among the rocks which sheltered them, and by the  fury of their outfall had driven the Spaniards in front of them in  headlong flight down the hill.
 In the centre only things seemed to be  going ill with the defenders.
 Black Simon was down--dying, as he would  wish to have died, like a grim old wolf in its lair with a ring of his  slain around him.
 Twice Sir Nigel had been overborne, and twice Alleyne  had fought over him until he had staggered to his feet once more.
  Burley lay senseless, stunned by a blow from a mace, and half of the  men-at-arms lay littered upon the ground around him.
 Sir Nigel's shield  was broken, his crest shorn, his armor cut and smashed, and the vizor  torn from his helmet; yet he sprang hither and thither with light  foot and ready hand, engaging two Bretons and a Spaniard at the same  instant--thrusting, stooping, dashing in, springing out--while Alleyne  still fought by his side, stemming with a handful of men the fierce tide  which surged up against them.
 Yet it would have fared ill with them  had not the archers from either side closed in upon the flanks of the  attackers, and pressed them very slowly and foot by foot down the long  slope, until they were on the plain once more, where their fellows were  already rallying for a fresh assault.
    But terrible indeed was the cost at which the last had been repelled.
  Of the three hundred and seventy men who had held the crest, one hundred  and seventy-two were left standing, many of whom were sorely wounded and  weak from loss of blood.
 Sir Oliver Buttesthorn, Sir Richard Causton,  Sir Simon Burley, Black Simon, Johnston, a hundred and fifty archers,  and forty-seven men-at-arms had fallen, while the pitiless hail of  stones was already whizzing and piping once more about their ears,  threatening every instant to further reduce their numbers.
    Sir Nigel looked about him at his shattered ranks, and his face flushed  with a soldier's pride.
    "By St.
 Paul!" he cried, "I have fought in many a little bickering, but  never one that I would be more loth to have missed than this.
 But you  are wounded, Alleyne?"    "It is nought," answered his squire, stanching the blood which dripped  from a sword-cut across his forehead.
    "These gentlemen of Spain seem to be most courteous and worthy people.
 I  see that they are already forming to continue this debate with us.
 Form  up the bowmen two deep instead of four.
 By my faith! some very brave men  have gone from among us.
 Aylward, you are a trusty soldier, for all  that your shoulder has never felt accolade, nor your heels worn the gold  spurs.
 Do you take charge of the right; I will hold the centre, and you,  my Lord of Angus, the left.
"    "Ho! for Sir Samkin Aylward!" cried a rough voice among the archers, and  a roar of laughter greeted their new leader.
    "By my hilt!" said the old bowman, "I never thought to lead a wing in a  stricken field.
 Stand close, camarades, for, by these finger-bones! we  must play the man this day.
"    "Come hither, Alleyne," said Sir Nigel, walking back to the edge of the  cliff which formed the rear of their position.
 "And you, Norbury," he  continued, beckoning to the squire of Sir Oliver, "do you also come  here.
"    The two squires hurried across to him, and the three stood looking down  into the rocky ravine which lay a hundred and fifty feet beneath them.
    "The prince must hear of how things are with us," said the knight.
  "Another onfall we may withstand, but they are many and we are few, so  that the time must come when we can no longer form line across the hill.
  Yet if help were brought us we might hold the crest until it comes.
 See  yonder horses which stray among the rocks beneath us?"    "I see them, my fair lord.
"    "And see yonder path which winds along the hill upon the further end of  the valley?"    "I see it.
"    "Were you on those horses, and riding up yonder track, steep and rough  as it is, I think that ye might gain the valley beyond.
 Then on to the  prince, and tell him how we fare.
"    "But, my fair lord, how can we hope to reach the horses?" asked Norbury.
    "Ye cannot go round to them, for they would be upon ye ere ye could come  to them.
 Think ye that ye have heart enough to clamber down this cliff?"    "Had we but a rope.
"    "There is one here.
 It is but one hundred feet long, and for the rest ye  must trust to God and to your fingers.
 Can you try it, Alleyne?"    "With all my heart, my dear lord, but how can I leave you in such a  strait?"    "Nay, it is to serve me that ye go.
 And you, Norbury?"    The silent squire said nothing, but he took up the rope, and, having  examined it, he tied one end firmly round a projecting rock.
 Then he  cast off his breast-plate, thigh pieces, and greaves, while Alleyne  followed his example.
    "Tell Chandos, or Calverley, or Knolles, should the prince have gone  forward," cried Sir Nigel.
 "Now may God speed ye, for ye are brave and  worthy men.
"    It was, indeed, a task which might make the heart of the bravest sink  within him.
 The thin cord dangling down the face of the brown cliff  seemed from above to reach little more than half-way down it.
 Beyond  stretched the rugged rock, wet and shining, with a green tuft here and  there thrusting out from it, but little sign of ridge or foothold.
 Far  below the jagged points of the boulders bristled up, dark and menacing.
  Norbury tugged thrice with all his strength upon the cord, and then  lowered himself over the edge, while a hundred anxious faces peered over  at him as he slowly clambered downwards to the end of the rope.
 Twice he  stretched out his foot, and twice he failed to reach the point at which  he aimed, but even as he swung himself for a third effort a stone from  a sling buzzed like a wasp from amid the rocks and struck him full upon  the side of his head.
 His grasp relaxed, his feet slipped, and in  an instant he was a crushed and mangled corpse upon the sharp ridges  beneath him.
    "If I have no better fortune," said Alleyne, leading Sir Nigel aside.
 "I  pray you, my dear lord, that you will give my humble service to the Lady  Maude, and say to her that I was ever her true servant and most unworthy  cavalier.
"    The old knight said no word, but he put a hand on either shoulder, and  kissed his squire, with the tears shining in his eyes.
 Alleyne sprang to  the rope, and sliding swiftly down, soon found himself at its extremity.
  From above it seemed as though rope and cliff were well-nigh touching,  but now, when swinging a hundred feet down, the squire found that he  could scarce reach the face of the rock with his foot, and that it was  as smooth as glass, with no resting-place where a mouse could stand.
  Some three feet lower, however, his eye lit upon a long jagged crack  which slanted downwards, and this he must reach if he would save not  only his own poor life, but that of the eight-score men above him.
 Yet  it were madness to spring for that narrow slit with nought but the wet,  smooth rock to cling to.
 He swung for a moment, full of thought, and  even as he hung there another of the hellish stones sang through his  curls, and struck a chip from the face of the cliff.
 Up he clambered  a few feet, drew up the loose end after him, unslung his belt, held on  with knee and with elbow while he spliced the long, tough leathern belt  to the end of the cord: then lowering himself as far as he could go, he  swung backwards and forwards until his hand reached the crack, when he  left the rope and clung to the face of the cliff.
 Another stone struck  him on the side, and he heard a sound like a breaking stick, with a keen  stabbing pain which shot through his chest.
 Yet it was no time now to  think of pain or ache.
 There was his lord and his eight-score comrades,  and they must be plucked from the jaws of death.
 On he clambered, with  his hand shuffling down the long sloping crack, sometimes bearing all  his weight upon his arms, at others finding some small shelf or tuft  on which to rest his foot.
 Would he never pass over that fifty feet? He  dared not look down and could but grope slowly onwards, his face to  the cliff, his fingers clutching, his feet scraping and feeling for a  support.
 Every vein and crack and mottling of that face of rock remained  forever stamped upon his memory.
 At last, however, his foot came upon  a broad resting-place and he ventured to cast a glance downwards.
 Thank  God! he had reached the highest of those fatal pinnacles upon which his  comrade had fallen.
 Quickly now he sprang from rock to rock until his  feet were on the ground, and he had his hand stretched out for the  horse's rein, when a sling-stone struck him on the head, and he dropped  senseless upon the ground.
    An evil blow it was for Alleyne, but a worse one still for him who  struck it.
 The Spanish slinger, seeing the youth lie slain, and judging  from his dress that he was no common man, rushed forward to plunder him,  knowing well that the bowmen above him had expended their last shaft.
  He was still three paces, however, from his victim's side when John  upon the cliff above plucked up a huge boulder, and, poising it for  an instant, dropped it with fatal aim upon the slinger beneath him.
 It  struck upon his shoulder, and hurled him, crushed and screaming, to the  ground, while Alleyne, recalled to his senses by these shrill cries in  his very ear, staggered on to his feet, and gazed wildly about him.
 His  eyes fell upon the horses, grazing upon the scanty pasture, and in an  instant all had come back to him--his mission, his comrades, the need  for haste.
 He was dizzy, sick, faint, but he must not die, and he must  not tarry, for his life meant many lives that day.
 In an instant he  was in his saddle and spurring down the valley.
 Loud rang the swift  charger's hoofs over rock and reef, while the fire flew from the stroke  of iron, and the loose stones showered up behind him.
 But his head was  whirling round, the blood was gushing from his brow, his temple, his  mouth.
 Ever keener and sharper was the deadly pain which shot like a  red-hot arrow through his side.
 He felt that his eye was glazing, his  senses slipping from him, his grasp upon the reins relaxing.
 Then with  one mighty effort, he called up all his strength for a single minute.
  Stooping down, he loosened the stirrup-straps, bound his knees tightly  to his saddle-flaps, twisted his hands in the bridle, and then, putting  the gallant horse's head for the mountain path, he dashed the spurs  in and fell forward fainting with his face buried in the coarse, black  mane.
    Little could he ever remember of that wild ride.
 Half conscious, but  ever with the one thought beating in his mind, he goaded the horse  onwards, rushing swiftly down steep ravines over huge boulders, along  the edges of black abysses.
 Dim memories he had of beetling cliffs, of a  group of huts with wondering faces at the doors, of foaming, clattering  water, and of a bristle of mountain beeches.
 Once, ere he had ridden  far, he heard behind him three deep, sullen shouts, which told him that  his comrades had set their faces to the foe once more.
 Then all was  blank, until he woke to find kindly blue English eyes peering down upon  him and to hear the blessed sound of his country's speech.
 They were but  a foraging party--a hundred archers and as many men-at-arms--but their  leader was Sir Hugh Calverley, and he was not a man to bide idle when  good blows were to be had not three leagues from him.
 A scout was sent  flying with a message to the camp, and Sir Hugh, with his two hundred  men, thundered off to the rescue.
 With them went Alleyne, still bound to  his saddle, still dripping with blood, and swooning and recovering, and  swooning once again.
 On they rode, and on, until, at last, topping a  ridge, they looked down upon the fateful valley.
 Alas! and alas! for the  sight that met their eyes.
    There, beneath them, was the blood-bathed hill, and from the highest  pinnacle there flaunted the yellow and white banner with the lions and  the towers of the royal house of Castile.
 Up the long slope rushed ranks  and ranks of men exultant, shouting, with waving pennons and brandished  arms.
 Over the whole summit were dense throngs of knights, with no enemy  that could be seen to face them, save only that at one corner of the  plateau an eddy and swirl amid the crowded mass seemed to show that all  resistance was not yet at an end.
 At the sight a deep groan of rage and  of despair went up from the baffled rescuers, and, spurring on their  horses, they clattered down the long and winding path which led to the  valley beneath.
    But they were too late to avenge, as they had been too late to save.
  Long ere they could gain the level ground, the Spaniards, seeing them  riding swiftly amid the rocks, and being ignorant of their numbers, drew  off from the captured hill, and, having secured their few prisoners,  rode slowly in a long column, with drum-beating and cymbal-clashing, out  of the valley.
 Their rear ranks were already passing out of sight ere  the new-comers were urging their panting, foaming horses up the slope  which had been the scene of that long drawn and bloody fight.
    And a fearsome sight it was that met their eyes! Across the lower end  lay the dense heap of men and horses where the first arrow-storm had  burst.
 Above, the bodies of the dead and the dying--French, Spanish, and  Aragonese--lay thick and thicker, until they covered the whole ground  two and three deep in one dreadful tangle of slaughter.
 Above them lay  the Englishmen in their lines, even as they had stood, and higher yet  upon the plateau a wild medley of the dead of all nations, where the  last deadly grapple had left them.
 In the further corner, under the  shadow of a great rock, there crouched seven bowmen, with great John  in the centre of them--all wounded, weary, and in sorry case, but still  unconquered, with their blood-stained weapons waving and their voices  ringing a welcome to their countrymen.
 Alleyne rode across to John,  while Sir Hugh Calverley followed close behind him.
    "By Saint George!" cried Sir Hugh, "I have never seen signs of so stern  a fight, and I am right glad that we have been in time to save you.
"    "You have saved more than us," said John, pointing to the banner which  leaned against the rock behind him.
    "You have done nobly," cried the old free companion, gazing with a  soldier's admiration at the huge frame and bold face of the archer.
 "But  why is it, my good fellow, that you sit upon this man.
"    "By the rood! I had forgot him," John answered, rising and dragging  from under him no less a person than the Spanish caballero, Don Diego  Alvarez.
 "This man, my fair lord, means to me a new house, ten cows,  one bull--if it be but a little one--a grindstone, and I know not what  besides; so that I thought it well to sit upon him, lest he should take  a fancy to leave me.
"    "Tell me, John," cried Alleyne faintly: "where is my dear lord, Sir  Nigel Loring?"    "He is dead, I fear.
 I saw them throw his body across a horse and ride  away with it, but I fear the life had gone from him.
"    "Now woe worth me! And where is Aylward?"    "He sprang upon a riderless horse and rode after Sir Nigel to save him.
  I saw them throng around him, and he is either taken or slain.
"    "Blow the bugles!" cried Sir Hugh, with a scowling brow.
 "We must back  to camp, and ere three days I trust that we may see these Spaniards  again.
 I would fain have ye all in my company.
"    "We are of the White Company, my fair lord," said John.
    "Nay, the White Company is here disbanded," answered Sir Hugh solemnly,  looking round him at the lines of silent figures.
 "Look to the brave  squire, for I fear that he will never see the sun rise again.
"        .
 OF THE HOME-COMING TO HAMPSHIRE.
      It was a bright July morning four months after that fatal fight in the  Spanish barranca.
 A blue heaven stretched above, a green rolling plain  undulated below, intersected with hedge-rows and flecked with grazing  sheep.
 The sun was yet low in the heaven, and the red cows stood in the  long shadow of the elms, chewing the cud and gazing with great vacant  eyes at two horsemen who were spurring it down the long white road which  dipped and curved away back to where the towers and pinnacles beneath  the flat-topped hill marked the old town of Winchester.
    Of the riders one was young, graceful, and fair, clad in plain doublet  and hosen of blue Brussels cloth, which served to show his active and  well-knit figure.
 A flat velvet cap was drawn forward to keep the glare  from his eyes, and he rode with lips compressed and anxious face, as one  who has much care upon his mind.
 Young as he was, and peaceful as  was his dress, the dainty golden spurs which twinkled upon his heels  proclaimed his knighthood, while a long seam upon his brow and a  scar upon his temple gave a manly grace to his refined and delicate  countenance.
 His comrade was a large, red-headed man upon a great black  horse, with a huge canvas bag slung from his saddle-bow, which jingled  and clinked with every movement of his steed.
 His broad, brown face was  lighted up by a continual smile, and he looked slowly from side to  side with eyes which twinkled and shone with delight.
 Well might John  rejoice, for was he not back in his native Hampshire, had he not Don  Diego's five thousand crowns rasping against his knee, and above all was  he not himself squire now to Sir Alleyne Edricson, the young Socman of  Minstead lately knighted by the sword of the Black Prince himself, and  esteemed by the whole army as one of the most rising of the soldiers of  England.
    For the last stand of the Company had been told throughout Christendom  wherever a brave deed of arms was loved, and honors had flowed in upon  the few who had survived it.
 For two months Alleyne had wavered betwixt  death and life, with a broken rib and a shattered head; yet youth and  strength and a cleanly life were all upon his side, and he awoke from  his long delirium to find that the war was over, that the Spaniards  and their allies had been crushed at Navaretta, and that the prince had  himself heard the tale of his ride for succor and had come in person to  his bedside to touch his shoulder with his sword and to insure that so  brave and true a man should die, if he could not live, within the order  of chivalry.
 The instant that he could set foot to ground Alleyne had  started in search of his lord, but no word could he hear of him, dead  or alive, and he had come home now sad-hearted, in the hope of raising  money upon his estates and so starting upon his quest once more.
 Landing  at London, he had hurried on with a mind full of care, for he had heard  no word from Hampshire since the short note which had announced his  brother's death.
    "By the rood!" cried John, looking around him exultantly, "where have we  seen since we left such noble cows, such fleecy sheep, grass so green,  or a man so drunk as yonder rogue who lies in the gap of the hedge?"    "Ah, John," Alleyne answered wearily, "it is well for you, but I never  thought that my home-coming would be so sad a one.
 My heart is heavy for  my dear lord and for Aylward, and I know not how I may break the news to  the Lady Mary and to the Lady Maude, if they have not yet had tidings of  it.
"    John gave a groan which made the horses shy.
 "It is indeed a black  business," said he.
 "But be not sad, for I shall give half these crowns  to my old mother, and half will I add to the money which you may have,  and so we shall buy that yellow cog wherein we sailed to Bordeaux, and  in it we shall go forth and seek Sir Nigel.
"    Alleyne smiled, but shook his head.
 "Were he alive we should have had  word of him ere now," said he.
 "But what is this town before us?"    "Why, it is Romsey!" cried John.
 "See the tower of the old gray church,  and the long stretch of the nunnery.
 But here sits a very holy man, and  I shall give him a crown for his prayers.
"    Three large stones formed a rough cot by the roadside, and beside it,  basking in the sun, sat the hermit, with clay-colored face, dull eyes,  and long withered hands.
 With crossed ankles and sunken head, he sat  as though all his life had passed out of him, with the beads slipping  slowly through his thin, yellow fingers.
 Behind him lay the narrow cell,  clay-floored and damp, comfortless, profitless and sordid.
 Beyond it  there lay amid the trees the wattle-and-daub hut of a laborer, the  door open, and the single room exposed to the view.
 The man ruddy and  yellow-haired, stood leaning upon the spade wherewith he had been at  work upon the garden patch.
 From behind him came the ripple of a happy  woman's laughter, and two young urchins darted forth from the hut,  bare-legged and towsy, while the mother, stepping out, laid her hand  upon her husband's arm and watched the gambols of the children.
 The  hermit frowned at the untoward noise which broke upon his prayers, but  his brow relaxed as he looked upon the broad silver piece which John  held out to him.
    "There lies the image of our past and of our future," cried Alleyne, as  they rode on upon their way.
 "Now, which is better, to till God's earth,  to have happy faces round one's knee, and to love and be loved, or  to sit forever moaning over one's own soul, like a mother over a sick  babe?"    "I know not about that," said John, "for it casts a great cloud over me  when I think of such matters.
 But I know that my crown was well spent,  for the man had the look of a very holy person.
 As to the other, there  was nought holy about him that I could see, and it would be cheaper for  me to pray for myself than to give a crown to one who spent his days in  digging for lettuces.
"    Ere Alleyne could answer there swung round the curve of the road a  lady's carriage drawn by three horses abreast with a postilion upon  the outer one.
 Very fine and rich it was, with beams painted and gilt,  wheels and spokes carved in strange figures, and over all an arched  cover of red and white tapestry.
 Beneath its shade there sat a stout  and elderly lady in a pink cote-hardie, leaning back among a pile of  cushions, and plucking out her eyebrows with a small pair of silver  tweezers.
 None could seem more safe and secure and at her ease than this  lady, yet here also was a symbol of human life, for in an instant, even  as Alleyne reined aside to let the carriage pass, a wheel flew out  from among its fellows, and over it all toppled--carving, tapestry  and gilt--in one wild heap, with the horses plunging, the postilion  shouting, and the lady screaming from within.
 In an instant Alleyne and  John were on foot, and had lifted her forth all in a shake with fear,  but little the worse for her mischance.
    "Now woe worth me!" she cried, "and ill fall on Michael Easover of  Romsey! for I told him that the pin was loose, and yet he must needs  gainsay me, like the foolish daffe that he is.
"    "I trust that you have taken no hurt, my fair lady," said Alleyne,  conducting her to the bank, upon which John had already placed a  cushion.
    "Nay, I have had no scath, though I have lost my silver tweezers.
 Now,  lack-a-day! did God ever put breath into such a fool as Michael Easover  of Romsey? But I am much beholden to you, gentle sirs.
 Soldiers ye are,  as one may readily see.
 I am myself a soldier's daughter," she added,  casting a somewhat languishing glance at John, "and my heart ever goes  out to a brave man.
"    "We are indeed fresh from Spain," quoth Alleyne.
    "From Spain, say you? Ah! it was an ill and sorry thing that so many  should throw away the lives that Heaven gave them.
 In sooth, it is bad  for those who fall, but worse for those who bide behind.
 I have but now  bid farewell to one who hath lost all in this cruel war.
"    "And how that, lady?"    "She is a young damsel of these parts, and she goes now into a nunnery.
  Alack! it is not a year since she was the fairest maid from Avon to  Itchen, and now it was more than I could abide to wait at Romsey Nunnery  to see her put the white veil upon her face, for she was made for a wife  and not for the cloister.
 Did you ever, gentle sir, hear of a body of  men called 'The White Company' over yonder?"    "Surely so," cried both the comrades.
    "Her father was the leader of it, and her lover served under him as  squire.
 News hath come that not one of the Company was left alive, and  so, poor lamb, she hath----"    "Lady!" cried Alleyne, with catching breath, "is it the Lady Maude  Loring of whom you speak?"    "It is, in sooth.
"    "Maude! And in a nunnery! Did, then, the thought of her father's death  so move her?"    "Her father!" cried the lady, smiling.
 "Nay; Maude is a good daughter,  but I think it was this young golden-haired squire of whom I have heard  who has made her turn her back upon the world.
"    "And I stand talking here!" cried Alleyne wildly.
 "Come, John, come!"    Rushing to his horse, he swung himself into the saddle, and was off down  the road in a rolling cloud of dust as fast as his good steed could bear  him.
    Great had been the rejoicing amid the Romsey nuns when the Lady Maude  Loring had craved admission into their order--for was she not sole child  and heiress of the old knight, with farms and fiefs which she could  bring to the great nunnery? Long and earnest had been the talks of the  gaunt lady abbess, in which she had conjured the young novice to turn  forever from the world, and to rest her bruised heart under the broad  and peaceful shelter of the church.
 And now, when all was settled, and  when abbess and lady superior had had their will, it was but fitting  that some pomp and show should mark the glad occasion.
 Hence was it that  the good burghers of Romsey were all in the streets, that gay flags and  flowers brightened the path from the nunnery to the church, and that a  long procession wound up to the old arched door leading up the bride to  these spiritual nuptials.
 There was lay-sister Agatha with the high gold  crucifix, and the three incense-bearers, and the two-and-twenty garbed  in white, who cast flowers upon either side of them and sang sweetly the  while.
 Then, with four attendants, came the novice, her drooping head  wreathed with white blossoms, and, behind, the abbess and her council of  older nuns, who were already counting in their minds whether their own  bailiff could manage the farms of Twynham, or whether a reeve would be  needed beneath him, to draw the utmost from these new possessions which  this young novice was about to bring them.
    But alas! for plots and plans when love and youth and nature, and above  all, fortune are arrayed against them.
 Who is this travel-stained youth  who dares to ride so madly through the lines of staring burghers? Why  does he fling himself from his horse and stare so strangely about  him? See how he has rushed through the incense-bearers, thrust aside  lay-sister Agatha, scattered the two-and-twenty damosels who sang so  sweetly--and he stands before the novice with his hands out-stretched,  and his face shining, and the light of love in his gray eyes.
 Her foot  is on the very lintel of the church, and yet he bars the way--and she,  she thinks no more of the wise words and holy rede of the lady abbess,  but she hath given a sobbing cry and hath fallen forward with his arms  around her drooping body and her wet cheek upon his breast.
 A sorry  sight this for the gaunt abbess, an ill lesson too for the stainless  two-and-twenty who have ever been taught that the way of nature is the  way of sin.
 But Maude and Alleyne care little for this.
 A dank, cold  air comes out from the black arch before them.
 Without, the sun shines  bright and the birds are singing amid the ivy on the drooping beeches.
  Their choice is made, and they turn away hand-in-hand, with their backs  to the darkness and their faces to the light.
    Very quiet was the wedding in the old priory church at Christchurch,  where Father Christopher read the service, and there were few to see  save the Lady Loring and John, and a dozen bowmen from the castle.
 The  Lady of Twynham had drooped and pined for weary months, so that her face  was harsher and less comely than before, yet she still hoped on, for her  lord had come through so many dangers that she could scarce believe that  he might be stricken down at last.
 It had been her wish to start for  Spain and to search for him, but Alleyne had persuaded her to let him  go in her place.
 There was much to look after, now that the lands of  Minstead were joined to those of Twynham, and Alleyne had promised her  that if she would but bide with his wife he would never come back to  Hampshire again until he had gained some news, good or ill, of her lord  and lover.
    The yellow cog had been engaged, with Goodwin Hawtayne in command, and a  month after the wedding Alleyne rode down to Bucklershard to see if she  had come round yet from Southampton.
 On the way he passed the fishing  village of Pitt's Deep, and marked that a little creyer or brig was  tacking off the land, as though about to anchor there.
 On his way back,  as he rode towards the village, he saw that she had indeed anchored, and  that many boats were round her, bearing cargo to the shore.
    A bow-shot from Pitt's Deep there was an inn a little back from the  road, very large and wide-spread, with a great green bush hung upon a  pole from one of the upper windows.
 At this window he marked, as he rode  up, that a man was seated who appeared to be craning his neck in his  direction.
 Alleyne was still looking up at him, when a woman came  rushing from the open door of the inn, and made as though she would  climb a tree, looking back the while with a laughing face.
 Wondering  what these doings might mean, Alleyne tied his horse to a tree, and  was walking amid the trunks towards the inn, when there shot from the  entrance a second woman who made also for the trees.
 Close at her heels  came a burly, brown-faced man, who leaned against the door-post and  laughed loudly with his hand to his side, "Ah, mes belles!" he cried,  "and is it thus you treat me? Ah, mes petites! I swear by these  finger-bones that I would not hurt a hair of your pretty heads; but I  have been among the black paynim, and, by my hilt! it does me good to  look at your English cheeks.
 Come, drink a stoup of muscadine with me,  mes anges, for my heart is warm to be among ye again.
"    At the sight of the man Alleyne had stood staring, but at the sound of  his voice such a thrill of joy bubbled up in his heart that he had  to bite his lip to keep himself from shouting outright.
 But a deeper  pleasure yet was in store.
 Even as he looked, the window above was  pushed outwards, and the voice of the man whom he had seen there came  out from it.
 "Aylward," cried the voice, "I have seen just now a very  worthy person come down the road, though my eyes could scarce discern  whether he carried coat-armor.
 I pray you to wait upon him and tell him  that a very humble knight of England abides here, so that if he be in  need of advancement, or have any small vow upon his soul, or desire to  exalt his lady, I may help him to accomplish it.
"    Aylward at this order came shuffling forward amid the trees, and in an  instant the two men were clinging in each other's arms, laughing and  shouting and patting each other in their delight; while old Sir Nigel  came running with his sword, under the impression that some small  bickering had broken out, only to embrace and be embraced himself,  until all three were hoarse with their questions and outcries and  congratulations.
    On their journey home through the woods Alleyne learnt their  wondrous story: how, when Sir Nigel came to his senses, he with his  fellow-captive had been hurried to the coast, and conveyed by sea to  their captor's castle; how upon the way they had been taken by a Barbary  rover, and how they exchanged their light captivity for a seat on a  galley bench and hard labor at the pirate's oars; how, in the port at  Barbary, Sir Nigel had slain the Moorish captain, and had swum with  Aylward to a small coaster which they had taken, and so made their way  to England with a rich cargo to reward them for their toils.
 All this  Alleyne listened to, until the dark keep of Twynham towered above them  in the gloaming, and they saw the red sun lying athwart the rippling  Avon.
 No need to speak of the glad hearts at Twynham Castle that night,  nor of the rich offerings from out that Moorish cargo which found their  way to the chapel of Father Christopher.
    Sir Nigel Loring lived for many years, full of honor and laden with  every blessing.
 He rode no more to the wars, but he found his way to  every jousting within thirty miles; and the Hampshire youth treasured  it as the highest honor when a word of praise fell from him as to their  management of their horses, or their breaking of their lances.
 So he  lived and so he died, the most revered and the happiest man in all his  native shire.
    For Sir Alleyne Edricson and for his beautiful bride the future had also  naught but what was good.
 Twice he fought in France, and came back each  time laden with honors.
 A high place at court was given to him, and  he spent many years at Windsor under the second Richard and the fourth  Henry--where he received the honor of the Garter, and won the name of  being a brave soldier, a true-hearted gentleman, and a great lover and  patron of every art and science which refines or ennobles life.
    As to John, he took unto himself a village maid, and settled in  Lyndhurst, where his five thousand crowns made him the richest franklin  for many miles around.
 For many years he drank his ale every night at  the "Pied Merlin," which was now kept by his friend Aylward, who had  wedded the good widow to whom he had committed his plunder.
 The strong  men and the bowmen of the country round used to drop in there of an  evening to wrestle a fall with John or to shoot a round with Aylward;  but, though a silver shilling was to be the prize of the victory, it has  never been reported that any man earned much money in that fashion.
  So they lived, these men, in their own lusty, cheery fashion--rude and  rough, but honest, kindly and true.
 Let us thank God if we have outgrown  their vices.
 Let us pray to God that we may ever hold their virtues.
 The  sky may darken, and the clouds may gather, and again the day may come  when Britain may have sore need of her children, on whatever shore of  the sea they be found.

        TO MY WORTHY FRIEND, MASTER THOMAS HAMMON, of GRAY'S INN, ETC.
    This play, composed by so worthy an author as Master Marlowe, and the  part of the Jew presented by so unimitable an actor as Master Alleyn,  being in this later age commended to the stage; as I ushered it unto the  court, and presented it to the Cock-pit, with these Prologues and  Epilogues here inserted, so now being newly brought to the press, I was  loath it should be published without the ornament of an Epistle; making  choice of you unto whom to devote it; than whom (of all those gentlemen  and acquaintance within the compass of my long knowledge) there is none  more able to tax ignorance, or attribute right to merit.
 Sir, you have  been pleased to grace some of mine own works [1] with your courteous  patronage:  I hope this will not be the worse accepted, because  commended by me; over whom none can claim more power or privilege than  yourself.
  I had no better a new-year's gift to present you with;  receive it therefore as a continuance of that inviolable obligement, by  which he rests still engaged, who, as he ever hath, shall always remain,         Tuissimus,            Tho.
 Heywood.
 [2]            THE PROLOGUE SPOKEN AT COURT.
         Gracious and great, that we so boldly dare       ('Mongst other plays that now in fashion are)       To present this, writ many years agone,       And in that age thought second unto none,       We humbly crave your pardon.
  We pursue       The story of a rich and famous Jew       Who liv'd in Malta:  you shall find him still,       In all his projects, a sound Machiavill;       And that's his character.
  He that hath past       So many censures [3] is now come at last       To have your princely ears:  grace you him; then       You crown the action, and renown the pen.
          EPILOGUE SPOKEN AT COURT.
         It is our fear, dread sovereign, we have bin [4]       Too tedious; neither can't be less than sin       To wrong your princely patience:  if we have,       Thus low dejected, we your pardon crave;       And, if aught here offend your ear or sight,       We only act and speak what others write.
          THE PROLOGUE TO THE STAGE, AT THE COCK-PIT.
         We know not how our play may pass this stage,       But by the best of poets [5] in that age       THE MALTA-JEW had being and was made;       And he then by the best of actors [6] play'd:       In HERO AND LEANDER [7] one did gain       A lasting memory; in Tamburlaine,       This Jew, with others many, th' other wan       The attribute of peerless, being a man       Whom we may rank with (doing no one wrong)       Proteus for shapes, and Roscius for a tongue,--       So could he speak, so vary; nor is't hate       To merit in him [8] who doth personate       Our Jew this day; nor is it his ambition       To exceed or equal, being of condition       More modest:  this is all that he intends,       (And that too at the urgence of some friends,)       To prove his best, and, if none here gainsay it,       The part he hath studied, and intends to play it.
          EPILOGUE TO THE STAGE, AT THE COCK-PIT.
         In graving with Pygmalion to contend,       Or painting with Apelles, doubtless the end       Must be disgrace:  our actor did not so,--       He only aim'd to go, but not out-go.
       Nor think that this day any prize was play'd; [9]       Here were no bets at all, no wagers laid: [10]       All the ambition that his mind doth swell,       Is but to hear from you (by me) 'twas well.

            THE JEW OF MALTA.
              Enter MACHIAVEL.
         MACHIAVEL.
 Albeit the world think Machiavel is dead,       Yet was his soul but flown beyond the Alps;       And, now the Guise [11] is dead, is come from France,       To view this land, and frolic with his friends.
       To some perhaps my name is odious;       But such as love me, guard me from their tongues,       And let them know that I am Machiavel,       And weigh not men, and therefore not men's words.
       Admir'd I am of those that hate me most:       Though some speak openly against my books,       Yet will they read me, and thereby attain       To Peter's chair; and, when they cast me off,       Are poison'd by my climbing followers.
       I count religion but a childish toy,       And hold there is no sin but ignorance.
       Birds of the air will tell of murders past!       I am asham'd to hear such fooleries.
       Many will talk of title to a crown:       What right had Caesar to the empery? [12]       Might first made kings, and laws were then most sure       When, like the Draco's, [13] they were writ in blood.
       Hence comes it that a strong-built citadel       Commands much more than letters can import:       Which maxim had [14] Phalaris observ'd,       H'ad never bellow'd, in a brazen bull,       Of great ones' envy:  o' the poor petty wights       Let me be envied and not pitied.
       But whither am I bound?  I come not, I,       To read a lecture here [15] in Britain,       But to present the tragedy of a Jew,       Who smiles to see how full his bags are cramm'd;       Which money was not got without my means.
       I crave but this,--grace him as he deserves,       And let him not be entertain'd the worse       Because he favours me.
            [Exit.
]          ACT I.
 [16]              BARABAS discovered in his counting-house, with heaps            of gold before him.
         BARABAS.
 So that of thus much that return was made;       And of the third part of the Persian ships       There was the venture summ'd and satisfied.
       As for those Samnites, [17] and the men of Uz,       That bought my Spanish oils and wines of Greece,       Here have I purs'd their paltry silverlings.
 [18]       Fie, what a trouble 'tis to count this trash!       Well fare the Arabians, who so richly pay       The things they traffic for with wedge of gold,       Whereof a man may easily in a day       Tell [19] that which may maintain him all his life.
       The needy groom, that never finger'd groat,       Would make a miracle of thus much coin;       But he whose steel-barr'd coffers are cramm'd full,       And all his life-time hath been tired,       Wearying his fingers' ends with telling it,       Would in his age be loath to labour so,       And for a pound to sweat himself to death.
       Give me the merchants of the Indian mines,       That trade in metal of the purest mould;       The wealthy Moor, that in the eastern rocks       Without control can pick his riches up,       And in his house heap pearl like pebble-stones,       Receive them free, and sell them by the weight;       Bags of fiery opals, sapphires, amethysts,       Jacinths, hard topaz, grass-green emeralds,       Beauteous rubies, sparkling diamonds,       And seld-seen [20] costly stones of so great price,       As one of them, indifferently rated,       And of a carat of this quantity,       May serve, in peril of calamity,       To ransom great kings from captivity.
       This is the ware wherein consists my wealth;       And thus methinks should men of judgment frame       Their means of traffic from the vulgar trade,       And, as their wealth increaseth, so inclose       Infinite riches in a little room.
       But now how stands the wind?       Into what corner peers my halcyon's bill? [21]       Ha! to the east? yes.
  See how stand the vanes--       East and by south:  why, then, I hope my ships       I sent for Egypt and the bordering isles       Are gotten up by Nilus' winding banks;       Mine argosy from Alexandria,       Loaden with spice and silks, now under sail,       Are smoothly gliding down by Candy-shore       To Malta, through our Mediterranean sea.
--       But who comes here?              Enter a MERCHANT.
                             How now!         MERCHANT.
 Barabas, thy ships are safe,       Riding in Malta-road; and all the merchants       With other merchandise are safe arriv'd,       And have sent me to know whether yourself       Will come and custom them.
 [22]         BARABAS.
 The ships are safe thou say'st, and richly fraught?         MERCHANT.
 They are.
         BARABAS.
 Why, then, go bid them come ashore,       And bring with them their bills of entry:       I hope our credit in the custom-house       Will serve as well as I were present there.
       Go send 'em threescore camels, thirty mules,       And twenty waggons, to bring up the ware.
       But art thou master in a ship of mine,       And is thy credit not enough for that?         MERCHANT.
 The very custom barely comes to more       Than many merchants of the town are worth,       And therefore far exceeds my credit, sir.
         BARABAS.
 Go tell 'em the Jew of Malta sent thee, man:       Tush, who amongst 'em knows not Barabas?         MERCHANT.
 I go.
         BARABAS.
 So, then, there's somewhat come.
--       Sirrah, which of my ships art thou master of?         MERCHANT.
 Of the Speranza, sir.
         BARABAS.
 And saw'st thou not       Mine argosy at Alexandria?       Thou couldst not come from Egypt, or by Caire,       But at the entry there into the sea,       Where Nilus pays his tribute to the main,       Thou needs must sail by Alexandria.
         MERCHANT.
 I neither saw them, nor inquir'd of them:       But this we heard some of our seamen say,       They wonder'd how you durst with so much wealth       Trust such a crazed vessel, and so far.
         BARABAS.
 Tush, they are wise!  I know her and her strength.
       But [23] go, go thou thy ways, discharge thy ship,       And bid my factor bring his loading in.
            [Exit MERCHANT.
]       And yet I wonder at this argosy.
              Enter a Second MERCHANT.
         SECOND MERCHANT.
 Thine argosy from Alexandria,       Know, Barabas, doth ride in Malta-road,       Laden with riches, and exceeding store       Of Persian silks, of gold, and orient pearl.
         BARABAS.
 How chance you came not with those other ships       That sail'd by Egypt?         SECOND MERCHANT.
 Sir, we saw 'em not.
         BARABAS.
 Belike they coasted round by Candy-shore       About their oils or other businesses.
       But 'twas ill done of you to come so far       Without the aid or conduct of their ships.
         SECOND MERCHANT.
 Sir, we were wafted by a Spanish fleet,       That never left us till within a league,       That had the galleys of the Turk in chase.
         BARABAS.
 O, they were going up to Sicily.
       Well, go,       And bid the merchants and my men despatch,       And come ashore, and see the fraught [24] discharg'd.
         SECOND MERCHANT.
 I go.
            [Exit.
]         BARABAS.
 Thus trolls our fortune in by land and sea,       And thus are we on every side enrich'd:       These are the blessings promis'd to the Jews,       And herein was old Abraham's happiness:       What more may heaven do for earthly man       Than thus to pour out plenty in their laps,       Ripping the bowels of the earth for them,       Making the sea[s] their servants, and the winds       To drive their substance with successful blasts?       Who hateth me but for my happiness?       Or who is honour'd now but for his wealth?       Rather had I, a Jew, be hated thus,       Than pitied in a Christian poverty;       For I can see no fruits in all their faith,       But malice, falsehood, and excessive pride,       Which methinks fits not their profession.
       Haply some hapless man hath conscience,       And for his conscience lives in beggary.
       They say we are a scatter'd nation:       I cannot tell; but we have scambled [25] up       More wealth by far than those that brag of faith:       There's Kirriah Jairim, the great Jew of Greece,       Obed in Bairseth, Nones in Portugal,       Myself in Malta, some in Italy,       Many in France, and wealthy every one;       Ay, wealthier far than any Christian.
       I must confess we come not to be kings:       That's not our fault:  alas, our number's few!       And crowns come either by succession,       Or urg'd by force; and nothing violent,       Oft have I heard tell, can be permanent.
       Give us a peaceful rule; make Christians kings,       That thirst so much for principality.
       I have no charge, nor many children,       But one sole daughter, whom I hold as dear       As Agamemnon did his Iphigen;       And all I have is hers.
--But who comes here?              Enter three JEWS.
 [26]         FIRST JEW.
 Tush, tell not me; 'twas done of policy.
         SECOND JEW.
 Come, therefore, let us go to Barabas;       For he can counsel best in these affairs:       And here he comes.
         BARABAS.
 Why, how now, countrymen!       Why flock you thus to me in multitudes?       What accident's betided to the Jews?         FIRST JEW.
 A fleet of warlike galleys, Barabas,       Are come from Turkey, and lie in our road:       And they this day sit in the council-house       To entertain them and their embassy.
         BARABAS.
 Why, let 'em come, so they come not to war;       Or let 'em war, so we be conquerors.
--       Nay, let 'em combat, conquer, and kill all,       So they spare me, my daughter, and my wealth.
            [Aside.
]         FIRST JEW.
 Were it for confirmation of a league,       They would not come in warlike manner thus.
         SECOND JEW.
 I fear their coming will afflict us all.
         BARABAS.
 Fond [27] men, what dream you of their multitudes?       What need they treat of peace that are in league?       The Turks and those of Malta are in league:       Tut, tut, there is some other matter in't.
         FIRST JEW.
 Why, Barabas, they come for peace or war.
         BARABAS.
 Haply for neither, but to pass along,       Towards Venice, by the Adriatic sea,       With whom they have attempted many times,       But never could effect their stratagem.
         THIRD JEW.
 And very wisely said; it may be so.
         SECOND JEW.
 But there's a meeting in the senate-house,       And all the Jews in Malta must be there.
         BARABAS.
 Hum,--all the Jews in Malta must be there!       Ay, like enough:  why, then, let every man       Provide him, and be there for fashion-sake.
       If any thing shall there concern our state,       Assure yourselves I'll look--unto myself.
            [Aside.
] [28]         FIRST JEW.
 I know you will.
--Well, brethren, let us go.
         SECOND JEW.
 Let's take our leaves.
--Farewell, good Barabas.
         BARABAS.
 [29] Farewell, Zaareth; farewell, Temainte.
            [Exeunt JEWS.
]       And, Barabas, now search this secret out;       Summon thy senses, call thy wits together:       These silly men mistake the matter clean.
       Long to the Turk did Malta contribute;       Which tribute all in policy, I fear,       The Turk has [30] let increase to such a sum       As all the wealth of Malta cannot pay;       And now by that advantage thinks, belike,       To seize upon the town; ay, that he seeks.
       Howe'er the world go, I'll make sure for one,       And seek in time to intercept the worst,       Warily guarding that which I ha' got:       Ego mihimet sum semper proximus: [31]       Why, let 'em enter, let 'em take the town.
            [Exit.
] [32]              Enter FERNEZE governor of Malta, KNIGHTS, and OFFICERS;            met by CALYMATH, and BASSOES of the TURK.
         FERNEZE.
 Now, bassoes, [33] what demand you at our hands?         FIRST BASSO.
 Know, knights of Malta, that we came from Rhodes,       ]From Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles       That lie betwixt the Mediterranean seas.
         FERNEZE.
 What's Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles       To us or Malta? what at our hands demand ye?         CALYMATH.
 The ten years' tribute that remains unpaid.
         FERNEZE.
 Alas, my lord, the sum is over-great!       I hope your highness will consider us.
         CALYMATH.
 I wish, grave governor, [34] 'twere in my power       To favour you; but 'tis my father's cause,       Wherein I may not, nay, I dare not dally.
         FERNEZE.
 Then give us leave, great Selim Calymath.
         CALYMATH.
 Stand all aside, [35] and let the knights determine;       And send to keep our galleys under sail,       For happily [36] we shall not tarry here.
--       Now, governor, how are you resolv'd?         FERNEZE.
 Thus; since your hard conditions are such       That you will needs have ten years' tribute past,       We may have time to make collection       Amongst the inhabitants of Malta for't.
         FIRST BASSO.
 That's more than is in our commission.
         CALYMATH.
 What, Callapine! a little courtesy:       Let's know their time; perhaps it is not long;       And 'tis more kingly to obtain by peace       Than to enforce conditions by constraint.
--       What respite ask you, governor?         FERNEZE.
 But a month.
         CALYMATH.
 We grant a month; but see you keep your promise.
       Now launch our galleys back again to sea,       Where we'll attend the respite you have ta'en,       And for the money send our messenger.
       Farewell, great governor, and brave knights of Malta.
         FERNEZE.
 And all good fortune wait on Calymath!            [Exeunt CALYMATH and BASSOES.
]       Go one and call those Jews of Malta hither:       Were they not summon'd to appear to-day?         FIRST OFFICER.
 They were, my lord; and here they come.
              Enter BARABAS and three JEWS.
         FIRST KNIGHT.
 Have you determin'd what to say to them?         FERNEZE.
 Yes; give me leave:--and, Hebrews, now come near.
       ]From the Emperor of Turkey is arriv'd       Great Selim Calymath, his highness' son,       To levy of us ten years' tribute past:       Now, then, here know that it concerneth us.
         BARABAS.
 Then, good my lord, to keep your quiet still,       Your lordship shall do well to let them have it.
         FERNEZE.
 Soft, Barabas! there's more 'longs to't than so.
       To what this ten years' tribute will amount,       That we have cast, but cannot compass it       By reason of the wars, that robb'd our store;       And therefore are we to request your aid.
         BARABAS.
 Alas, my lord, we are no soldiers!       And what's our aid against so great a prince?         FIRST KNIGHT.
 Tut, Jew, we know thou art no soldier:       Thou art a merchant and a money'd man,       And 'tis thy money, Barabas, we seek.
         BARABAS.
 How, my lord! my money!         FERNEZE.
 Thine and the rest;       For, to be short, amongst you't must be had.
         FIRST JEW.
 Alas, my lord, the most of us are poor!         FERNEZE.
 Then let the rich increase your portions.
         BARABAS.
 Are strangers with your tribute to be tax'd?         SECOND KNIGHT.
 Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth?       Then let them with us contribute.
         BARABAS.
 How! equally?         FERNEZE.
 No, Jew, like infidels;       For through our sufferance of your hateful lives,       Who stand accursed in the sight of heaven,       These taxes and afflictions are befall'n,       And therefore thus we are determined.
--       Read there the articles of our decrees.
         OFFICER.
 [37] [reads] FIRST, THE TRIBUTE-MONEY OF THE TURKS       SHALL ALL BE LEVIED AMONGST THE JEWS, AND EACH OF THEM TO PAY       ONE HALF OF HIS ESTATE.
         BARABAS.
 How! half his estate!--I hope you mean not mine.
            [Aside.
]         FERNEZE.
 Read on.
         OFFICER.
 [reads] SECONDLY, HE THAT DENIES [38] TO PAY, SHALL       STRAIGHT-BECOME A CHRISTIAN.
         BARABAS.
 How! a Christian!--Hum,--what's here to do?            [Aside.
]         OFFICER.
 [reads] LASTLY, HE THAT DENIES THIS, SHALL ABSOLUTELY       LOSE ALL HE HAS.
         THREE JEWS.
 O my lord, we will give half!         BARABAS.
 O earth-mettled villains, and no Hebrews born!       And will you basely thus submit yourselves       To leave your goods to their arbitrement?         FERNEZE.
 Why, Barabas, wilt thou be christened?         BARABAS.
 No, governor, I will be no convertite.
 [39]         FERNEZE.
 Then pay thy half.
         BARABAS.
 Why, know you what you did by this device?       Half of my substance is a city's wealth.
       Governor, it was not got so easily;       Nor will I part so slightly therewithal.
         FERNEZE.
 Sir, half is the penalty of our decree;       Either pay that, or we will seize on all.
         BARABAS.
 Corpo di Dio! stay:  you shall have half;       Let me be us'd but as my brethren are.
         FERNEZE.
 No, Jew, thou hast denied the articles,       And now it cannot be recall'd.
            [Exeunt OFFICERS, on a sign from FERNEZE]         BARABAS.
 Will you, then, steal my goods?       Is theft the ground of your religion?         FERNEZE.
 No, Jew; we take particularly thine,       To save the ruin of a multitude:       And better one want for a common good,       Than many perish for a private man:       Yet, Barabas, we will not banish thee,       But here in Malta, where thou gott'st thy wealth,       Live still; and, if thou canst, get more.
         BARABAS.
 Christians, what or how can I multiply?       Of naught is nothing made.
         FIRST KNIGHT.
 From naught at first thou cam'st to little wealth,       ]From little unto more, from more to most:       If your first curse fall heavy on thy head,       And make thee poor and scorn'd of all the world,       'Tis not our fault, but thy inherent sin.
         BARABAS.
 What, bring you Scripture to confirm your wrongs?       Preach me not out of my possessions.
       Some Jews are wicked, as all Christians are:       But say the tribe that I descended of       Were all in general cast away for sin,       Shall I be tried by their transgression?       The man that dealeth righteously shall live;       And which of you can charge me otherwise?         FERNEZE.
 Out, wretched Barabas!       Sham'st thou not thus to justify thyself,       As if we knew not thy profession?       If thou rely upon thy righteousness,       Be patient, and thy riches will increase.
       Excess of wealth is cause of covetousness;       And covetousness, O, 'tis a monstrous sin!         BARABAS.
 Ay, but theft is worse:  tush! take not from me, then,       For that is theft; and, if you rob me thus,       I must be forc'd to steal, and compass more.
         FIRST KNIGHT.
 Grave governor, list not to his exclaims:       Convert his mansion to a nunnery;       His house will harbour many holy nuns.
         FERNEZE.
 It shall be so.
              Re-enter OFFICERS.
                             Now, officers, have you done?         FIRST OFFICER.
 Ay, my lord, we have seiz'd upon the goods       And wares of Barabas, which, being valu'd,       Amount to more than all the wealth in Malta:       And of the other we have seized half.
         FERNEZE.
 Then we'll take [40] order for the residue.
         BARABAS.
 Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?       You have my goods, my money, and my wealth,       My ships, my store, and all that I enjoy'd;       And, having all, you can request no more,       Unless your unrelenting flinty hearts       Suppress all pity in your stony breasts,       And now shall move you to bereave my life.
         FERNEZE.
 No, Barabas; to stain our hands with blood       Is far from us and our profession.
         BARABAS.
  Why, I esteem the injury far less,       To take the lives of miserable men       Than be the causers of their misery.
       You have my wealth, the labour of my life,       The comfort of mine age, my children's hope;       And therefore ne'er distinguish of the wrong.
         FERNEZE.
 Content thee, Barabas; thou hast naught but right.
         BARABAS.
 Your extreme right does me exceeding wrong:       But take it to you, i'the devil's name!         FERNEZE.
 Come, let us in, and gather of these goods       The money for this tribute of the Turk.
         FIRST KNIGHT.
 'Tis necessary that be look'd unto;       For, if we break our day, we break the league,       And that will prove but simple policy.
            [Exeunt all except BARABAS and the three JEWS.
]         BARABAS.
 Ay, policy! that's their profession,       And not simplicity, as they suggest.
--       The plagues of Egypt, and the curse of heaven,       Earth's barrenness, and all men's hatred,       Inflict upon them, thou great Primus Motor!       And here upon my knees, striking the earth,       I ban their souls to everlasting pains,       And extreme tortures of the fiery deep,       That thus have dealt with me in my distress!         FIRST JEW.
 O, yet be patient, gentle Barabas!         BARABAS.
 O silly brethren, born to see this day,       Why stand you thus unmov'd with my laments?       Why weep you not to think upon my wrongs?       Why pine not I, and die in this distress?         FIRST JEW.
 Why, Barabas, as hardly can we brook       The cruel handling of ourselves in this:       Thou seest they have taken half our goods.
         BARABAS.
 Why did you yield to their extortion?       You were a multitude, and I but one;       And of me only have they taken all.
         FIRST JEW.
 Yet, brother Barabas, remember Job.
         BARABAS.
 What tell you me of Job? I wot his wealth       Was written thus; he had seven thousand sheep,       Three thousand camels, and two hundred yoke       Of labouring oxen, and five hundred       She-asses:  but for every one of those,       Had they been valu'd at indifferent rate,       I had at home, and in mine argosy,       And other ships that came from Egypt last,       As much as would have bought his beasts and him,       And yet have kept enough to live upon;       So that not he, but I, may curse the day,       Thy fatal birth-day, forlorn Barabas;       And henceforth wish for an eternal night,       That clouds of darkness may inclose my flesh,       And hide these extreme sorrows from mine eyes;       For only I have toil'd to inherit here       The months of vanity, and loss of time,       And painful nights, have been appointed me.
         SECOND JEW.
 Good Barabas, be patient.
         BARABAS.
 Ay, I pray, leave me in my patience.
  You, that       Were ne'er possess'd of wealth, are pleas'd with want;       But give him liberty at least to mourn,       That in a field, amidst his enemies,       Doth see his soldiers slain, himself disarm'd,       And knows no means of his recovery:       Ay, let me sorrow for this sudden chance;       'Tis in the trouble of my spirit I speak:       Great injuries are not so soon forgot.
         FIRST JEW.
 Come, let us leave him; in his ireful mood       Our words will but increase his ecstasy.
 [41]         SECOND JEW.
 On, then:  but, trust me, 'tis a misery       To see a man in such affliction.
--       Farewell, Barabas.
         BARABAS.
 Ay, fare you well.
            [Exeunt three JEWS.
] [42]       See the simplicity of these base slaves,       Who, for the villains have no wit themselves,       Think me to be a senseless lump of clay,       That will with every water wash to dirt!       No, Barabas is born to better chance,       And fram'd of finer mould than common men,       That measure naught but by the present time.
       A reaching thought will search his deepest wits,       And cast with cunning for the time to come;       For evils are apt to happen every day.
              Enter ABIGAIL.
         But whither wends my beauteous Abigail?       O, what has made my lovely daughter sad?       What, woman! moan not for a little loss;       Thy father has enough in store for thee.
         ABIGAIL.
 Nor for myself, but aged Barabas,       Father, for thee lamenteth Abigail:       But I will learn to leave these fruitless tears;       And, urg'd thereto with my afflictions,       With fierce exclaims run to the senate-house,       And in the senate reprehend them all,       And rent their hearts with tearing of my hair,       Till they reduce [43] the wrongs done to my father.
         BARABAS.
 No, Abigail; things past recovery       Are hardly cur'd with exclamations:       Be silent, daughter; sufferance breeds ease,       And time may yield us an occasion,       Which on the sudden cannot serve the turn.
       Besides, my girl, think me not all so fond [44]       As negligently to forgo so much       Without provision for thyself and me:       Ten thousand portagues, [45] besides great pearls,       Rich costly jewels, and stones infinite,       Fearing the worst of this before it fell,       I closely hid.
         ABIGAIL.
 Where, father?         BARABAS.
 In my house, my girl.
         ABIGAIL.
 Then shall they ne'er be seen of Barabas;       For they have seiz'd upon thy house and wares.
         BARABAS.
 But they will give me leave once more, I trow,       To go into my house.
         ABIGAIL.
 That may they not;       For there I left the governor placing nuns,       Displacing me; and of thy house they mean       To make a nunnery, where none but their own sect [46]       Must enter in; men generally barr'd.
         BARABAS.
 My gold, my gold, and all my wealth is gone!--       You partial heavens, have I deserv'd this plague?       What, will you thus oppose me, luckless stars,       To make me desperate in my poverty?       And, knowing me impatient in distress,       Think me so mad as I will hang myself,       That I may vanish o'er the earth in air,       And leave no memory that e'er I was?       No, I will live; nor loathe I this my life:       And, since you leave me in the ocean thus       To sink or swim, and put me to my shifts,       I'll rouse my senses, and awake myself.
--       Daughter, I have it:  thou perceiv'st the plight       Wherein these Christians have oppressed me:       Be rul'd by me, for in extremity       We ought to make bar of no policy.
         ABIGAIL.
 Father, whate'er it be, to injure them       That have so manifestly wronged us,       What will not Abigail attempt?         BARABAS.
 Why, so.
       Then thus:  thou told'st me they have turn'd my house       Into a nunnery, and some nuns are there?         ABIGAIL.
 I did.
         BARABAS.
 Then, Abigail, there must my girl       Entreat the abbess to be entertain'd.
         ABIGAIL.
 How! as a nun?         BARABAS.
 Ay, daughter; for religion       Hides many mischiefs from suspicion.
         ABIGAIL.
 Ay, but, father, they will suspect me there.
         BARABAS.
 Let 'em suspect; but be thou so precise       As they may think it done of holiness:       Entreat 'em fair, and give them friendly speech,       And seem to them as if thy sins were great,       Till thou hast gotten to be entertain'd.
         ABIGAIL.
 Thus, father, shall I much dissemble.
         BARABAS.
 Tush!       As good dissemble that thou never mean'st,       As first mean truth and then dissemble it:       A counterfeit profession is better       Than unseen hypocrisy.
         ABIGAIL.
 Well, father, say I be entertain'd,       What then shall follow?         BARABAS.
 This shall follow then.
       There have I hid, close underneath the plank       That runs along the upper-chamber floor,       The gold and jewels which I kept for thee:--       But here they come:  be cunning, Abigail.
         ABIGAIL.
 Then, father, go with me.
         BARABAS.
 No, Abigail, in this       It is not necessary I be seen;       For I will seem offended with thee for't:       Be close, my girl, for this must fetch my gold.
            [They retire.
]              Enter FRIAR JACOMO, [47] FRIAR BARNARDINE, ABBESS, and a NUN.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Sisters,       We now are almost at the new-made nunnery.
         ABBESS.
 [48] The better; for we love not to be seen:       'Tis thirty winters long since some of us       Did stray so far amongst the multitude.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 But, madam, this house       And waters of this new-made nunnery       Will much delight you.
         ABBESS.
 It may be so.
--But who comes here?              [ABIGAIL comes forward.
]         ABIGAIL.
 Grave abbess, and you happy virgins' guide,       Pity the state of a distressed maid!         ABBESS.
 What art thou, daughter?         ABIGAIL.
 The hopeless daughter of a hapless Jew,       The Jew of Malta, wretched Barabas,       Sometimes [49] the owner of a goodly house,       Which they have now turn'd to a nunnery.
         ABBESS.
 Well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?         ABIGAIL.
 Fearing the afflictions which my father feels       Proceed from sin or want of faith in us,       I'd pass away my life in penitence,       And be a novice in your nunnery,       To make atonement for my labouring soul.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 No doubt, brother, but this proceedeth of       the spirit.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
       Ay, and of a moving spirit too, brother:  but come,       Let us entreat she may be entertain'd.
         ABBESS.
 Well, daughter, we admit you for a nun.
         ABIGAIL.
 First let me as a novice learn to frame       My solitary life to your strait laws,       And let me lodge where I was wont to lie:       I do not doubt, by your divine precepts       And mine own industry, but to profit much.
         BARABAS.
 As much, I hope, as all I hid is worth.
            [Aside.
]         ABBESS.
 Come, daughter, follow us.
         BARABAS.
 [coming forward] Why, how now, Abigail!       What mak'st thou 'mongst these hateful Christians?         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Hinder her not, thou man of little faith,       For she has mortified herself.
         BARABAS.
 How! mortified!         FRIAR JACOMO.
 And is admitted to the sisterhood.
         BARABAS.
 Child of perdition, and thy father's shame!       What wilt thou do among these hateful fiends?       I charge thee on my blessing that thou leave       These devils and their damned heresy!         ABIGAIL.
 Father, forgive me-- [50]         BARABAS.
 Nay, back, Abigail,       And think upon the jewels and the gold;       The board is marked thus that covers it.
--            [Aside to ABIGAIL in a whisper.
]       Away, accursed, from thy father's sight!         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Barabas, although thou art in misbelief,       And wilt not see thine own afflictions,       Yet let thy daughter be no longer blind.
         BARABAS.
 Blind friar, I reck not thy persuasions,--       The board is marked thus [51] that covers it--            [Aside to ABIGAIL in a whisper.
]       For I had rather die than see her thus.
--       Wilt thou forsake me too in my distress,       Seduced daughter?--Go, forget not.
-- [52]            [Aside to her in a whisper.
]       Becomes it Jews to be so credulous?--       To-morrow early I'll be at the door.
--            [Aside to her in a whisper.
]       No, come not at me; if thou wilt be damn'd,       Forget me, see me not; and so, be gone!--       Farewell; remember to-morrow morning.
--            [Aside to her in a whisper.
]       Out, out, thou wretch!            [Exit, on one side, BARABAS.
  Exeunt, on the other side,            FRIARS, ABBESS, NUN, and ABIGAIL:  and, as they are going            out,]              Enter MATHIAS.
         MATHIAS.
 Who's this? fair Abigail, the rich Jew's daughter,       Become a nun! her father's sudden fall       Has humbled her, and brought her down to this:       Tut, she were fitter for a tale of love,       Than to be tired out with orisons;       And better would she far become a bed,       Embraced in a friendly lover's arms,       Than rise at midnight to a solemn mass.
              Enter LODOWICK.
         LODOWICK.
 Why, how now, Don Mathias! in a dump?         MATHIAS.
 Believe me, noble Lodowick, I have seen       The strangest sight, in my opinion,       That ever I beheld.
         LODOWICK.
 What was't, I prithee?         MATHIAS.
 A fair young maid, scarce fourteen years of age,       The sweetest flower in Cytherea's field,       Cropt from the pleasures of the fruitful earth,       And strangely metamorphos'd [to a] nun.
         LODOWICK.
 But say, what was she?         MATHIAS.
 Why, the rich Jew's daughter.
         LODOWICK.
 What, Barabas, whose goods were lately seiz'd?       Is she so fair?         MATHIAS.
 And matchless beautiful,       As, had you seen her, 'twould have mov'd your heart,       Though countermin'd with walls of brass, to love,       Or, at the least, to pity.
         LODOWICK.
 An if she be so fair as you report,       'Twere time well spent to go and visit her:       How say you? shall we?         MATHIAS.
 I must and will, sir; there's no remedy.
         LODOWICK.
 And so will I too, or it shall go hard.
       Farewell, Mathias.
         MATHIAS.
 Farewell, Lodowick.
            [Exeunt severally.
]          ACT II.
              Enter BARABAS, with a light.
 [53]         BARABAS.
 Thus, like the sad-presaging raven, that tolls       The sick man's passport in her hollow beak, [54]       And in the shadow of the silent night       Doth shake contagion from her sable wings,       Vex'd and tormented runs poor Barabas       With fatal curses towards these Christians.
       The incertain pleasures of swift-footed time       Have ta'en their flight, and left me in despair;       And of my former riches rests no more       But bare remembrance; like a soldier's scar,       That has no further comfort for his maim.
--       O Thou, that with a fiery pillar ledd'st       The sons of Israel through the dismal shades,       Light Abraham's offspring; and direct the hand       Of Abigail this night! or let the day       Turn to eternal darkness after this!--       No sleep can fasten on my watchful eyes,       Nor quiet enter my distemper'd thoughts,       Till I have answer of my Abigail.
              Enter ABIGAIL above.
         ABIGAIL.
 Now have I happily espied a time       To search the plank my father did appoint;       And here, behold, unseen, where I have found       The gold, the pearls, and jewels, which he hid.
         BARABAS.
 Now I remember those old women's words,       Who in my wealth would tell me winter's tales,       And speak of spirits and ghosts that glide by night       About the place where treasure hath been hid:       And now methinks that I am one of those;       For, whilst I live, here lives my soul's sole hope,       And, when I die, here shall my spirit walk.
         ABIGAIL.
 Now that my father's fortune were so good       As but to be about this happy place!       'Tis not so happy:  yet, when we parted last,       He said he would attend me in the morn.
       Then, gentle Sleep, where'er his body rests,       Give charge to Morpheus that he may dream       A golden dream, and of [55] the sudden wake, [56]       Come and receive the treasure I have found.
         BARABAS.
 Bueno para todos mi ganado no era: [57]       As good go on, as sit so sadly thus.
--       But stay:  what star shines yonder in the east? [58]       The loadstar of my life, if Abigail.
--       Who's there?         ABIGAIL.
 Who's that?         BARABAS.
 Peace, Abigail! 'tis I.
         ABIGAIL.
 Then, father, here receive thy happiness.
         BARABAS.
 Hast thou't?         ABIGAIL.
 Here.
[throws down bags]  Hast thou't?       There's more, and more, and more.
         BARABAS.
 O my girl,       My gold, my fortune, my felicity,       Strength to my soul, death to mine enemy;       Welcome the first beginner of my bliss!       O Abigail, Abigail, that I had thee here too!       Then my desires were fully satisfied:       But I will practice thy enlargement thence:       O girl! O gold! O beauty! O my bliss!            [Hugs the bags.
]         ABIGAIL.
 Father, it draweth towards midnight now,       And 'bout this time the nuns begin to wake;       To shun suspicion, therefore, let us part.
         BARABAS.
 Farewell, my joy, and by my fingers take       A kiss from him that sends it from his soul.
            [Exit ABIGAIL above.
]       Now, Phoebus, ope the eye-lids of the day.
       And, for the raven, wake the morning lark,       That I may hover with her in the air,       Singing o'er these, as she does o'er her young.
       Hermoso placer de los dineros.
 [59]            [Exit.
]              Enter FERNEZE, [60] MARTIN DEL BOSCO, KNIGHTS, and OFFICERS.
         FERNEZE.
 Now, captain, tell us whither thou art bound?       Whence is thy ship that anchors in our road?       And why thou cam'st ashore without our leave?         MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
 Governor of Malta, hither am I bound;       My ship, the Flying Dragon, is of Spain,       And so am I; Del Bosco is my name,       Vice-admiral unto the Catholic King.
         FIRST KNIGHT.
 'Tis true, my lord; therefore entreat [61] him well.
         MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
       Our fraught is Grecians, Turks, and Afric Moors;       For late upon the coast of Corsica,       Because we vail'd not [62] to the Turkish [63] fleet,       Their creeping galleys had us in the chase:       But suddenly the wind began to rise,       And then we luff'd and tack'd, [64] and fought at ease:       Some have we fir'd, and many have we sunk;       But one amongst the rest became our prize:       The captain's slain; the rest remain our slaves,       Of whom we would make sale in Malta here.
         FERNEZE.
 Martin del Bosco, I have heard of thee:       Welcome to Malta, and to all of us!       But to admit a sale of these thy Turks,       We may not, nay, we dare not give consent,       By reason of a tributary league.
         FIRST KNIGHT.
 Del Bosco, as thou lov'st and honour'st us,       Persuade our governor against the Turk:       This truce we have is but in hope of gold,       And with that sum he craves might we wage war.
         MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
 Will knights of Malta be in league with Turks,       And buy it basely too for sums of gold?       My lord, remember that, to Europe's shame,       The Christian isle of Rhodes, from whence you came,       Was lately lost, and you were stated [65] here       To be at deadly enmity with Turks.
         FERNEZE.
 Captain, we know it; but our force is small.
         MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
 What is the sum that Calymath requires?         FERNEZE.
 A hundred thousand crowns.
         MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
 My lord and king hath title to this isle,       And he means quickly to expel you hence;       Therefore be rul'd by me, and keep the gold:       I'll write unto his majesty for aid,       And not depart until I see you free.
         FERNEZE.
 On this condition shall thy Turks be sold.
--       Go, officers, and set them straight in show.
--            [Exeunt OFFICERS.
]       Bosco, thou shalt be Malta's general;       We and our warlike knights will follow thee       Against these barbarous misbelieving Turks.
         MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
 So shall you imitate those you succeed;       For, when their hideous force environ'd Rhodes,       Small though the number was that kept the town,       They fought it out, and not a man surviv'd       To bring the hapless news to Christendom.
         FERNEZE.
 So will we fight it out:  come, let's away.
       Proud daring Calymath, instead of gold,       We'll send thee bullets wrapt in smoke and fire:       Claim tribute where thou wilt, we are resolv'd,--       Honour is bought with blood, and not with gold.
            [Exeunt.
]              Enter OFFICERS, [66] with ITHAMORE and other SLAVES.
         FIRST OFFICER.
 This is the market-place; here let 'em stand:       Fear not their sale, for they'll be quickly bought.
         SECOND OFFICER.
 Every one's price is written on his back,       And so much must they yield, or not be sold.
         FIRST OFFICER.
       Here comes the Jew:  had not his goods been seiz'd,       He'd give us present money for them all.
              Enter BARABAS.
         BARABAS.
 In spite of these swine-eating Christians,       (Unchosen nation, never circumcis'd,       Poor villains, such as were [67] ne'er thought upon       Till Titus and Vespasian conquer'd us,)       Am I become as wealthy as I was.
       They hop'd my daughter would ha' been a nun;       But she's at home, and I have bought a house       As great and fair as is the governor's:       And there, in spite of Malta, will I dwell,       Having Ferneze's hand; whose heart I'll have,       Ay, and his son's too, or it shall go hard.
       I am not of the tribe of Levi, I,       That can so soon forget an injury.
       We Jews can fawn like spaniels when we please;       And when we grin we bite; yet are our looks       As innocent and harmless as a lamb's.
       I learn'd in Florence how to kiss my hand,       Heave up my shoulders when they call me dog,       And duck as low as any bare-foot friar;       Hoping to see them starve upon a stall,       Or else be gather'd for in our synagogue,       That, when the offering-basin comes to me,       Even for charity I may spit into't.
--       Here comes Don Lodowick, the governor's son,       One that I love for his good father's sake.
              Enter LODOWICK.
         LODOWICK.
 I hear the wealthy Jew walked this way:       I'll seek him out, and so insinuate,       That I may have a sight of Abigail,       For Don Mathias tells me she is fair.
         BARABAS.
 Now will I shew myself to have more of the serpent than       the dove; that is, more knave than fool.
            [Aside.
]         LODOWICK.
 Yond' walks the Jew:  now for fair Abigail.
         BARABAS.
 Ay, ay, no doubt but she's at your command.
            [Aside.
]         LODOWICK.
 Barabas, thou know'st I am the governor's son.
         BARABAS.
       I would you were his father too, sir! that's all the harm       I wish you.
--The slave looks like a hog's cheek new-singed.
            [Aside.
]         LODOWICK.
 Whither walk'st thou, Barabas?         BARABAS.
 No further:  'tis a custom held with us,       That when we speak with Gentiles like to you,       We turn into [68] the air to purge ourselves;       For unto us the promise doth belong.
         LODOWICK.
 Well, Barabas, canst help me to a diamond?         BARABAS.
 O, sir, your father had my diamonds:       Yet I have one left that will serve your turn.
--       I mean my daughter; but, ere he shall have her,       I'll sacrifice her on a pile of wood:       I ha' the poison of the city [69] for him,       And the white leprosy.
            [Aside.
]         LODOWICK.
 What sparkle does it give without a foil?         BARABAS.
 The diamond that I talk of ne'er was foil'd:--       But, when he touches it, it will be foil'd.
-- [70]            [Aside.
]       Lord Lodowick, it sparkles bright and fair.
         LODOWICK.
 Is it square or pointed? pray, let me know.
         BARABAS.
 Pointed it is, good sir,--but not for you.
            [Aside.
]         LODOWICK.
 I like it much the better.
         BARABAS.
 So do I too.
         LODOWICK.
 How shews it by night?         BARABAS.
 Outshines Cynthia's rays:--       You'll like it better far o' nights than days.
            [Aside.
]         LODOWICK.
 And what's the price?         BARABAS.
 Your life, an if you have it [Aside].
--O my lord,       We will not jar about the price:  come to my house,       And I will give't your honour--with a vengeance.
            [Aside.
]         LODOWICK.
 No, Barabas, I will deserve it first.
         BARABAS.
 Good sir,       Your father has deserv'd it at my hands,       Who, of mere charity and Christian ruth,       To bring me to religious purity,       And, as it were, in catechising sort,       To make me mindful of my mortal sins,       Against my will, and whether I would or no,       Seiz'd all I had, and thrust me out o' doors,       And made my house a place for nuns most chaste.
         LODOWICK.
 No doubt your soul shall reap the fruit of it.
         BARABAS.
 Ay, but, my lord, the harvest is far off:       And yet I know the prayers of those nuns       And holy friars, having money for their pains,       Are wondrous;--and indeed do no man good;--            [Aside.
]       And, seeing they are not idle, but still doing,       'Tis likely they in time may reap some fruit,       I mean, in fullness of perfection.
         LODOWICK.
 Good Barabas, glance not at our holy nuns.
         BARABAS.
 No, but I do it through a burning zeal,--       Hoping ere long to set the house a-fire;       For, though they do a while increase and multiply,       I'll have a saying to that nunnery.
-- [71]            [Aside.
]       As for the diamond, sir, I told you of,       Come home, and there's no price shall make us part,       Even for your honourable father's sake,--       It shall go hard but I will see your death.
--            [Aside.
]       But now I must be gone to buy a slave.
         LODOWICK.
 And, Barabas, I'll bear thee company.
         BARABAS.
 Come, then; here's the market-place.
--       What's the price of this slave? two hundred crowns! do the Turks       weigh so much?         FIRST OFFICER.
 Sir, that's his price.
         BARABAS.
 What, can he steal, that you demand so much?       Belike he has some new trick for a purse;       An if he has, he is worth three hundred plates, [72]       So that, being bought, the town-seal might be got       To keep him for his life-time from the gallows:       The sessions-day is critical to thieves,       And few or none scape but by being purg'd.
         LODOWICK.
 Rat'st thou this Moor but at two hundred plates?         FIRST OFFICER.
 No more, my lord.
         BARABAS.
 Why should this Turk be dearer than that Moor?         FIRST OFFICER.
 Because he is young, and has more qualities.
         BARABAS.
 What, hast the philosopher's stone? an thou hast, break       my head with it, I'll forgive thee.
         SLAVE.
 [73] No, sir; I can cut and shave.
         BARABAS.
 Let me see, sirrah; are you not an old shaver?         SLAVE.
 Alas, sir, I am a very youth!         BARABAS.
 A youth! I'll buy you, and marry you to Lady Vanity, [74]       if you do well.
         SLAVE.
 I will serve you, sir.
         BARABAS.
 Some wicked trick or other:  it may be, under colour       of shaving, thou'lt cut my throat for my goods.
  Tell me,       hast thou thy health well?         SLAVE.
 Ay, passing well.
         BARABAS.
 So much the worse:  I must have one that's sickly, an't       be but for sparing victuals:  'tis not a stone of beef a-day       will maintain you in these chops.
--Let me see one that's       somewhat leaner.
         FIRST OFFICER.
 Here's a leaner; how like you him?         BARABAS.
 Where wast thou born?         ITHAMORE.
 In Thrace; brought up in Arabia.
         BARABAS.
 So much the better; thou art for my turn.
       An hundred crowns?  I'll have him; there's the coin.
            [Gives money.
]         FIRST OFFICER.
 Then mark him, sir, and take him hence.
         BARABAS.
 Ay, mark him, you were best; for this is he       That by my help shall do much villany.
--            [Aside.
]       My lord, farewell.
--Come, sirrah; you are mine.
--       As for the diamond, it shall be yours:       I pray, sir, be no stranger at my house;       All that I have shall be at your command.
              Enter MATHIAS and KATHARINE.
 [75]         MATHIAS.
 What make the Jew and Lodowick so private?       I fear me 'tis about fair Abigail.
            [Aside.

 [to LODOWICK.
] Yonder comes Don Mathias; let us stay: [76]       He loves my daughter, and she holds him dear;       But I have sworn to frustrate both their hopes,       And be reveng'd upon the--governor.
            [Aside.

]         KATHARINE.
 This Moor is comeliest, is he not? speak, son.
         MATHIAS.
 No, this is the better, mother, view this well.
         BARABAS.
 Seem not to know me here before your mother,       Lest she mistrust the match that is in hand:       When you have brought her home, come to my house;       Think of me as thy father:  son, farewell.
         MATHIAS.
 But wherefore talk'd Don Lodowick with you?         BARABAS.
 Tush, man! we talk'd of diamonds, not of Abigail.
         KATHARINE.
 Tell me, Mathias, is not that the Jew?         BARABAS.
 As for the comment on the Maccabees,       I have it, sir, and 'tis at your command.
         MATHIAS.
 Yes, madam, and my talk with him was [77]       About the borrowing of a book or two.
         KATHARINE.
 Converse not with him; he is cast off from heaven.
--       Thou hast thy crowns, fellow.
--Come, let's away.
         MATHIAS.
 Sirrah Jew, remember the book.
         BARABAS.
 Marry, will I, sir.
            [Exeunt KATHARlNE and MATHIAS.
]         FIRST OFFICER.
 Come, I have made a reasonable market; let's away.
            [Exeunt OFFICERS with SLAVES.
]         BARABAS.
 Now let me know thy name, and therewithal       Thy birth, condition, and profession.
         ITHAMORE.
 Faith, sir, my birth is but mean; my name's Ithamore;       my profession what you please.
         BARABAS.
 Hast thou no trade? then listen to my words,       And I will teach [thee] that shall stick by thee:       First, be thou void of these affections,       Compassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;       Be mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,       But to thyself smile when the Christians moan.
         ITHAMORE.
 O, brave, master! [78] I worship your nose [79] for this.
         BARABAS.
 As for myself, I walk abroad o' nights,       And kill sick people groaning under walls:       Sometimes I go about and poison wells;       And now and then, to cherish Christian thieves,       I am content to lose some of my crowns,       That I may, walking in my gallery,       See 'em go pinion'd along by my door.
       Being young, I studied physic, and began       To practice first upon the Italian;       There I enrich'd the priests with burials,       And always kept the sexton's arms in ure [80]       With digging graves and ringing dead men's knells:       And, after that, was I an engineer,       And in the wars 'twixt France and Germany,       Under pretence of helping Charles the Fifth,       Slew friend and enemy with my stratagems:       Then, after that, was I an usurer,       And with extorting, cozening, forfeiting,       And tricks belonging unto brokery,       I fill'd the gaols with bankrupts in a year,       And with young orphans planted hospitals;       And every moon made some or other mad,       And now and then one hang himself for grief,       Pinning upon his breast a long great scroll       How I with interest tormented him.
       But mark how I am blest for plaguing them;--       I have as much coin as will buy the town.
       But tell me now, how hast thou spent thy time?         ITHAMORE.
 Faith, master,       In setting Christian villages on fire,       Chaining of eunuchs, binding galley-slaves.
       One time I was an hostler in an inn,       And in the night-time secretly would I steal       To travellers' chambers, and there cut their throats:       Once at Jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,       I strewed powder on the marble stones,       And therewithal their knees would rankle so,       That I have laugh'd a-good [81] to see the cripples       Go limping home to Christendom on stilts.
         BARABAS.
 Why, this is something:  make account of me       As of thy fellow; we are villains both;       Both circumcised; we hate Christians both:       Be true and secret; thou shalt want no gold.
       But stand aside; here comes Don Lodowick.
              Enter LODOWICK.
 [82]         LODOWICK.
 O, Barabas, well met;       Where is the diamond you told me of?         BARABAS.
 I have it for you, sir:  please you walk in with me.
--       What, ho, Abigail! open the door, I say!              Enter ABIGAIL, with letters.
         ABIGAIL.
 In good time, father; here are letters come       ]From Ormus, and the post stays here within.
         BARABAS.
 Give me the letters.
--Daughter, do you hear?       Entertain Lodowick, the governor's son,       With all the courtesy you can afford,       Provided that you keep your maidenhead:       Use him as if he were a Philistine;       Dissemble, swear, protest, vow love to him: [83]       He is not of the seed of Abraham.
--            [Aside to her.
]       I am a little busy, sir; pray, pardon me.
--       Abigail, bid him welcome for my sake.
         ABIGAIL.
 For your sake and his own he's welcome hither.
         BARABAS.
 Daughter, a word more:  kiss him, speak him fair,       And like a cunning Jew so cast about,       That ye be both made sure [84] ere you come out.
            [Aside to her.
]         ABIGAIL.
 O father, Don Mathias is my love!         BARABAS.
 I know it:  yet, I say, make love to him;       Do, it is requisite it should be so.
--            [Aside to her.
]       Nay, on my life, it is my factor's hand;       But go you in, I'll think upon the account.
            [Exeunt ABIGAIL and LODOWICK into the house.
]       The account is made, for Lodovico [85] dies.
       My factor sends me word a merchant's fled       That owes me for a hundred tun of wine:       I weigh it thus much[snapping his fingers]!  I have wealth enough;       For now by this has he kiss'd Abigail,       And she vows love to him, and he to her.
       As sure as heaven rain'd manna for the Jews,       So sure shall he and Don Mathias die:       His father was my chiefest enemy.
              Enter MATHIAS.
         Whither goes Don Mathias? stay a while.
         MATHIAS.
 Whither, but to my fair love Abigail?         BARABAS.
 Thou know'st, and heaven can witness it is true,       That I intend my daughter shall be thine.
         MATHIAS.
 Ay, Barabas, or else thou wrong'st me much.
         BARABAS.
 O, heaven forbid I should have such a thought!       Pardon me though I weep:  the governor's son       Will, whether I will or no, have Abigail;       He sends her letters, bracelets, jewels, rings.
         MATHIAS.
 Does she receive them?         BARABAS.
 She! no, Mathias, no, but sends them back;       And, when he comes, she locks herself up fast;       Yet through the key-hole will he talk to her,       While she runs to the window, looking out       When you should come and hale him from the door.
         MATHIAS.
 O treacherous Lodowick!         BARABAS.
 Even now, as I came home, he slipt me in,       And I am sure he is with Abigail.
         MATHIAS.
 I'll rouse him thence.
         BARABAS.
 Not for all Malta; therefore sheathe your sword;       If you love me, no quarrels in my house;       But steal you in, and seem to see him not:       I'll give him such a warning ere he goes,       As he shall have small hopes of Abigail.
       Away, for here they come.
              Re-enter LODOWICK and ABIGAIL.
         MATHIAS.
 What, hand in hand! I cannot suffer this.
         BARABAS.
 Mathias, as thou lov'st me, not a word.
         MATHIAS.
 Well, let it pass; another time shall serve.
            [Exit into the house.
]         LODOWICK.
 Barabas, is not that the widow's son?         BARABAS.
 Ay, and take heed, for he hath sworn your death.
         LODOWICK.
 My death! what, is the base-born peasant mad?         BARABAS.
 No, no; but happily [86] he stands in fear       Of that which you, I think, ne'er dream upon,--       My daughter here, a paltry silly girl.
         LODOWICK.
 Why, loves she Don Mathias?         BARABAS.
 Doth she not with her smiling answer you?         ABIGAIL.
 He has my heart; I smile against my will.
            [Aside.
]         LODOWICK.
 Barabas, thou know'st I have lov'd thy daughter long.
         BARABAS.
 And so has she done you, even from a child.
         LODOWICK.
 And now I can no longer hold my mind.
         BARABAS.
 Nor I the affection that I bear to you.
         LODOWICK.
 This is thy diamond; tell me, shall I have it?         BARABAS.
 Win it, and wear it; it is yet unsoil'd.
 [87]       O, but I know your lordship would disdain       To marry with the daughter of a Jew:       And yet I'll give her many a golden cross [88]       With Christian posies round about the ring.
         LODOWICK.
 'Tis not thy wealth, but her that I esteem;       Yet crave I thy consent.
         BARABAS.
 And mine you have; yet let me talk to her.
--       This offspring of Cain, this Jebusite,       That never tasted of the Passover,       Nor e'er shall see the land of Canaan,       Nor our Messias that is yet to come;       This gentle maggot, Lodowick, I mean,       Must be deluded:  let him have thy hand,       But keep thy heart till Don Mathias comes.
            [Aside to her.
]         ABIGAIL.
 What, shall I be betroth'd to Lodowick?         BARABAS.
 It's no sin to deceive a Christian;       For they themselves hold it a principle,       Faith is not to be held with heretics:       But all are heretics that are not Jews;       This follows well, and therefore, daughter, fear not.
--            [Aside to her.
]       I have entreated her, and she will grant.
         LODOWICK.
 Then, gentle Abigail, plight thy faith to me.
         ABIGAIL.
 I cannot choose, seeing my father bids:       Nothing but death shall part my love and me.
         LODOWICK.
 Now have I that for which my soul hath long'd.
         BARABAS.
 So have not I; but yet I hope I shall.
            [Aside.
]         ABIGAIL.
 O wretched Abigail, what hast thou [89] done?            [Aside.
]         LODOWICK.
 Why on the sudden is your colour chang'd?         ABIGAIL.
 I know not:  but farewell; I must be gone.
         BARABAS.
 Stay her, but let her not speak one word more.
         LODOWICK.
 Mute o' the sudden! here's a sudden change.
         BARABAS.
 O, muse not at it; 'tis the Hebrews' guise,       That maidens new-betroth'd should weep a while:       Trouble her not; sweet Lodowick, depart:       She is thy wife, and thou shalt be mine heir.
         LODOWICK.
 O, is't the custom? then I am resolv'd: [90]       But rather let the brightsome heavens be dim,       And nature's beauty choke with stifling clouds,       Than my fair Abigail should frown on me.
--       There comes the villain; now I'll be reveng'd.
              Re-enter MATHIAS.
         BARABAS.
 Be quiet, Lodowick; it is enough       That I have made thee sure to Abigail.
         LODOWICK.
 Well, let him go.
            [Exit.
]         BARABAS.
 Well, but for me, as you went in at doors       You had been stabb'd:  but not a word on't now;       Here must no speeches pass, nor swords be drawn.
         MATHIAS.
 Suffer me, Barabas, but to follow him.
         BARABAS.
 No; so shall I, if any hurt be done,       Be made an accessary of your deeds:       Revenge it on him when you meet him next.
         MATHIAS.
 For this I'll have his heart.
         BARABAS.
 Do so.
  Lo, here I give thee Abigail!         MATHIAS.
 What greater gift can poor Mathias have?       Shall Lodowick rob me of so fair a love?       My life is not so dear as Abigail.
         BARABAS.
 My heart misgives me, that, to cross your love,       He's with your mother; therefore after him.
         MATHIAS.
 What, is he gone unto my mother?         BARABAS.
 Nay, if you will, stay till she comes herself.
         MATHIAS.
 I cannot stay; for, if my mother come,       She'll die with grief.
            [Exit.
]         ABIGAIL.
 I cannot take my leave of him for tears.
       Father, why have you thus incens'd them both?         BARABAS.
 What's that to thee?         ABIGAIL.
 I'll make 'em friends again.
         BARABAS.
       You'll make 'em friends! are there not Jews enow in Malta,       But thou must dote upon a Christian?         ABIGAIL.
 I will have Don Mathias; he is my love.
         BARABAS.
 Yes, you shall have him.
--Go, put her in.
         ITHAMORE.
 Ay, I'll put her in.
            [Puts in ABIGAIL.
]         BARABAS.
 Now tell me, Ithamore, how lik'st thou this?         ITHAMORE.
 Faith, master, I think by this       You purchase both their lives:  is it not so?         BARABAS.
 True; and it shall be cunningly perform'd.
         ITHAMORE.
 O, master, that I might have a hand in this!         BARABAS.
 Ay, so thou shalt; 'tis thou must do the deed:       Take this, and bear it to Mathias straight,            [Giving a letter.
]       And tell him that it comes from Lodowick.
         ITHAMORE.
 'Tis poison'd, is it not?         BARABAS.
 No, no; and yet it might be done that way:       It is a challenge feign'd from Lodowick.
         ITHAMORE.
 Fear not; I will so set his heart a-fire,       That he shall verily think it comes from him.
         BARABAS.
 I cannot choose but like thy readiness:       Yet be not rash, but do it cunningly.
         ITHAMORE.
 As I behave myself in this, employ me hereafter.
         BARABAS.
 Away, then!            [Exit ITHAMORE.
]       So; now will I go in to Lodowick,       And, like a cunning spirit, feign some lie,       Till I have set 'em both at enmity.
            [Exit.
]          ACT III.
              Enter BELLAMIRA.
 [91]         BELLAMIRA.
 Since this town was besieg'd, my gain grows cold:       The time has been, that but for one bare night       A hundred ducats have been freely given;       But now against my will I must be chaste:       And yet I know my beauty doth not fail.
       ]From Venice merchants, and from Padua       Were wont to come rare-witted gentlemen,       Scholars I mean, learned and liberal;       And now, save Pilia-Borza, comes there none,       And he is very seldom from my house;       And here he comes.
              Enter PILIA-BORZA.
         PILIA-BORZA.
       Hold thee, wench, there's something for thee to spend.
            [Shewing a bag of silver.
]         BELLAMIRA.
 'Tis silver; I disdain it.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Ay, but the Jew has gold,       And I will have it, or it shall go hard.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Tell me, how cam'st thou by this?         PILIA-BORZA.
 Faith, walking the back-lanes, through the gardens,       I chanced to cast mine eye up to the Jew's counting-house, where       I saw some bags of money, and in the night I clambered up with       my hooks; and, as I was taking my choice, I heard a rumbling in       the house; so I took only this, and run my way.
--But here's the       Jew's man.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Hide the bag.
              Enter ITHAMORE.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Look not towards him, let's away.
  Zoons, what a       looking thou keepest! thou'lt betray's anon.
            [Exeunt BELLAMIRA and PILIA-BORZA.
]         ITHAMORE.
 O, the sweetest face that ever I beheld!  I know she       is a courtezan by her attire:  now would I give a hundred of       the Jew's crowns that I had such a concubine.
       Well, I have deliver'd the challenge in such sort,       As meet they will, and fighting die,--brave sport!            [Exit.
]              Enter MATHIAS.
         MATHIAS.
 This is the place: [92]  now Abigail shall see       Whether Mathias holds her dear or no.

         What, dares the villain write in such base terms?            [Looking at a letter.

 O, bravely fought! and yet they thrust not home.
       Now, Lodovico! [93] now, Mathias!--So;            [Both fall.
]       So, now they have shew'd themselves to be tall [94] fellows.
              [Cries within] Part 'em, part 'em!         BARABAS.
 Ay, part 'em now they are dead.
  Farewell, farewell!            [Exit above.

         FERNEZE.
 What sight is this! [95] my Lodovico [96] slain!       These arms of mine shall be thy sepulchre.
 [97]         KATHARINE.
 Who is this? my son Mathias slain!         FERNEZE.
 O Lodowick, hadst thou perish'd by the Turk,       Wretched Ferneze might have veng'd thy death!         KATHARINE.
 Thy son slew mine, and I'll revenge his death.
         FERNEZE.
 Look, Katharine, look! thy son gave mine these wounds.
         KATHARINE.
 O, leave to grieve me!  I am griev'd enough.
         FERNEZE.
 O, that my sighs could turn to lively breath,       And these my tears to blood, that he might live!         KATHARINE.
 Who made them enemies?         FERNEZE.
 I know not; and that grieves me most of all.
         KATHARINE.
 My son lov'd thine.
         FERNEZE.
 And so did Lodowick him.
         KATHARINE.
 Lend me that weapon that did kill my son,       And it shall murder me.
         FERNEZE.
 Nay, madam, stay; that weapon was my son's,       And on that rather should Ferneze die.
         KATHARINE.
 Hold; let's inquire the causers of their deaths,       That we may venge their blood upon their heads.
         FERNEZE.
 Then take them up, and let them be interr'd       Within one sacred monument of stone;       Upon which altar I will offer up       My daily sacrifice of sighs and tears,       And with my prayers pierce impartial heavens,       Till they [reveal] the causers of our smarts,       Which forc'd their hands divide united hearts.
       Come, Katharine; [98] our losses equal are;       Then of true grief let us take equal share.

 [99]         ITHAMORE.
 Why, was there ever seen such villany,       So neatly plotted, and so well perform'd?       Both held in hand, [100] and flatly both beguil'd?              Enter ABIGAIL.
         ABIGAIL.
 Why, how now, Ithamore! why laugh'st thou so?         ITHAMORE.
 O mistress! ha, ha, ha!         ABIGAIL.
 Why, what ail'st thou?         ITHAMORE.
 O, my master!         ABIGAIL.
 Ha!         ITHAMORE.
 O mistress, I have the bravest, gravest, secret,       subtle, bottle-nosed [101] knave to my master, that ever       gentleman had!         ABIGAIL.
 Say, knave, why rail'st upon my father thus?         ITHAMORE.
 O, my master has the bravest policy!         ABIGAIL.
 Wherein?         ITHAMORE.
 Why, know you not?         ABIGAIL.
 Why, no.
         ITHAMORE.
       Know you not of Mathia[s'] and Don Lodowick['s] disaster?         ABIGAIL.
 No:  what was it?         ITHAMORE.
 Why, the devil inverted a challenge, my master       writ it, and I carried it, first to Lodowick, and imprimis       to Mathia[s];       And then they met, [and], as the story says,       In doleful wise they ended both their days.
         ABIGAIL.
 And was my father furtherer of their deaths?         ITHAMORE.
 Am I Ithamore?         ABIGAIL.
 Yes.
         ITHAMORE.
       So sure did your father write, and I carry the challenge.
         ABIGAIL.
 Well, Ithamore, let me request thee this;       Go to the new-made nunnery, and inquire       For any of the friars of Saint Jaques, [102]       And say, I pray them come and speak with me.
         ITHAMORE.
 I pray, mistress, will you answer me to one question?         ABIGAIL.
 Well, sirrah, what is't?         ITHAMORE.
 A very feeling one:  have not the nuns fine sport with       the friars now and then?         ABIGAIL.
 Go to, Sirrah Sauce! is this your question? get ye gone.
         ITHAMORE.
 I will, forsooth, mistress.
            [Exit.
]         ABIGAIL.
 Hard-hearted father, unkind Barabas!       Was this the pursuit of thy policy,       To make me shew them favour severally,       That by my favour they should both be slain?       Admit thou lov'dst not Lodowick for his sire, [103]       Yet Don Mathias ne'er offended thee:       But thou wert set upon extreme revenge,       Because the prior dispossess'd thee once,       And couldst not venge it but upon his son;       Nor on his son but by Mathias' means;       Nor on Mathias but by murdering me:       But I perceive there is no love on earth,       Pity in Jews, nor piety in Turks.
--       But here comes cursed Ithamore with the friar.
              Re-enter ITHAMORE with FRIAR JACOMO.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Virgo, salve.
         ITHAMORE.
 When duck you?         ABIGAIL.
 Welcome, grave friar.
--Ithamore, be gone.
            [Exit ITHAMORE.
]       Know, holy sir, I am bold to solicit thee.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Wherein?         ABIGAIL.
 To get me be admitted for a nun.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Why, Abigail, it is not yet long since       That I did labour thy admission,       And then thou didst not like that holy life.
         ABIGAIL.
 Then were my thoughts so frail and unconfirm'd       As [104] I was chain'd to follies of the world:       But now experience, purchased with grief,       Has made me see the difference of things.
       My sinful soul, alas, hath pac'd too long       The fatal labyrinth of misbelief,       Far from the sun that gives eternal life!         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Who taught thee this?         ABIGAIL.
 The abbess of the house,       Whose zealous admonition I embrace:       O, therefore, Jacomo, let me be one,       Although unworthy, of that sisterhood!         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Abigail, I will:  but see thou change no more,       For that will be most heavy to thy soul.
         ABIGAIL.
 That was my father's fault.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Thy father's! how?         ABIGAIL.
 Nay, you shall pardon me.
--O Barabas,       Though thou deservest hardly at my hands,       Yet never shall these lips bewray thy life!            [Aside.
]         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Come, shall we go?         ABIGAIL.
 My duty waits on you.
            [Exeunt.
]              Enter BARABAS, [105] reading a letter.
         BARABAS.
 What, Abigail become a nun again!       False and unkind! what, hast thou lost thy father?       And, all unknown and unconstrain'd of me,       Art thou again got to the nunnery?       Now here she writes, and wills me to repent:       Repentance! Spurca! what pretendeth [106] this?       I fear she knows--'tis so--of my device       In Don Mathias' and Lodovico's deaths:       If so, 'tis time that it be seen into;       For she that varies from me in belief,       Gives great presumption that she loves me not,       Or, loving, doth dislike of something done.
--       But who comes here?              Enter ITHAMORE.
                             O Ithamore, come near;       Come near, my love; come near, thy master's life,       My trusty servant, nay, my second self; [107]       For I have now no hope but even in thee,       And on that hope my happiness is built.
       When saw'st thou Abigail?         ITHAMORE.
 To-day.
         BARABAS.
 With whom?         ITHAMORE.
 A friar.
         BARABAS.
 A friar! false villain, he hath done the deed.
         ITHAMORE.
 How, sir!         BARABAS.
 Why, made mine Abigail a nun.
         ITHAMORE.
 That's no lie; for she sent me for him.
         BARABAS.
 O unhappy day!       False, credulous, inconstant Abigail!       But let 'em go:  and, Ithamore, from hence       Ne'er shall she grieve me more with her disgrace;       Ne'er shall she live to inherit aught of mine,       Be bless'd of me, nor come within my gates,       But perish underneath my bitter curse,       Like Cain by Adam for his brother's death.
         ITHAMORE.
 O master--         BARABAS.
 Ithamore, entreat not for her; I am mov'd,       And she is hateful to my soul and me:       And, 'less [108] thou yield to this that I entreat,       I cannot think but that thou hat'st my life.
         ITHAMORE.
 Who, I, master? why, I'll run to some rock,       And throw myself headlong into the sea;       Why, I'll do any thing for your sweet sake.
         BARABAS.
 O trusty Ithamore! no servant, but my friend!       I here adopt thee for mine only heir:       All that I have is thine when I am dead;       And, whilst I live, use half; spend as myself;       Here, take my keys,--I'll give 'em thee anon;       Go buy thee garments; but thou shalt not want:       Only know this, that thus thou art to do--       But first go fetch me in the pot of rice       That for our supper stands upon the fire.
         ITHAMORE.
 I hold my head, my master's hungry [Aside].
--I go, sir.
            [Exit.
]         BARABAS.
 Thus every villain ambles after wealth,       Although he ne'er be richer than in hope:--       But, husht!              Re-enter ITHAMORE with the pot.
         ITHAMORE.
 Here 'tis, master.
         BARABAS.
 Well said, [109] Ithamore!  What, hast thou brought       The ladle with thee too?         ITHAMORE.
 Yes, sir; the proverb says, [110] he that eats with the       devil had need of a long spoon; I have brought you a ladle.
         BARABAS.
 Very well, Ithamore; then now be secret;       And, for thy sake, whom I so dearly love,       Now shalt thou see the death of Abigail,       That thou mayst freely live to be my heir.
         ITHAMORE.
 Why, master, will you poison her with a mess of rice-       porridge? that will preserve life, make her round and plump, and       batten [111] more than you are aware.
         BARABAS.
 Ay, but, Ithamore, seest thou this?       It is a precious powder that I bought       Of an Italian, in Ancona, once,       Whose operation is to bind, infect,       And poison deeply, yet not appear       In forty hours after it is ta'en.
         ITHAMORE.
 How, master?         BARABAS.
 Thus, Ithamore:       This even they use in Malta here,--'tis call'd       Saint Jaques' Even,--and then, I say, they use       To send their alms unto the nunneries:       Among the rest, bear this, and set it there:       There's a dark entry where they take it in,       Where they must neither see the messenger,       Nor make inquiry who hath sent it them.
         ITHAMORE.
 How so?         BARABAS.
 Belike there is some ceremony in't.
       There, Ithamore, must thou go place this pot: [112]       Stay; let me spice it first.
         ITHAMORE.
 Pray, do, and let me help you, master.
       Pray, let me taste first.
         BARABAS.
 Prithee, do.
[ITHAMORE tastes.
]  What say'st thou now?         ITHAMORE.
 Troth, master, I'm loath such a pot of pottage should       be spoiled.
         BARABAS.
 Peace, Ithamore! 'tis better so than spar'd.
            [Puts the powder into the pot.
]       Assure thyself thou shalt have broth by the eye: [113]       My purse, my coffer, and myself is thine.
         ITHAMORE.
 Well, master, I go.
         BARABAS.
 Stay; first let me stir it, Ithamore.
       As fatal be it to her as the draught       Of which great Alexander drunk, and died;       And with her let it work like Borgia's wine,       Whereof his sire the Pope was poisoned!       In few, [114] the blood of Hydra, Lerna's bane,       The juice of hebon, [115] and Cocytus' breath,       And all the poisons of the Stygian pool,       Break from the fiery kingdom, and in this       Vomit your venom, and envenom her       That, like a fiend, hath left her father thus!         ITHAMORE.
 What a blessing has he given't! was ever pot of       rice-porridge so sauced? [Aside].
--What shall I do with it?         BARABAS.
 O my sweet Ithamore, go set it down;       And come again so soon as thou hast done,       For I have other business for thee.
         ITHAMORE.
 Here's a drench to poison a whole stable of Flanders       mares:  I'll carry't to the nuns with a powder.
         BARABAS.
 And the horse-pestilence to boot:  away!         ITHAMORE.
 I am gone:       Pay me my wages, for my work is done.
            [Exit with the pot.
]         BARABAS.
 I'll pay thee with a vengeance, Ithamore!            [Exit.
]              Enter FERNEZE, [116] MARTIN DEL BOSCO, KNIGHTS, and BASSO.
         FERNEZE.
 Welcome, great basso: [117]  how fares Calymath?       What wind drives you thus into Malta-road?         BASSO.
 The wind that bloweth all the world besides,       Desire of gold.
         FERNEZE.
 Desire of gold, great sir!       That's to be gotten in the Western Inde:       In Malta are no golden minerals.
         BASSO.
 To you of Malta thus saith Calymath:       The time you took for respite is at hand       For the performance of your promise pass'd;       And for the tribute-money I am sent.
         FERNEZE.
 Basso, in brief, shalt have no tribute here,       Nor shall the heathens live upon our spoil:       First will we raze the city-walls ourselves,       Lay waste the island, hew the temples down,       And, shipping off our goods to Sicily,       Open an entrance for the wasteful sea,       Whose billows, beating the resistless banks, [118]       Shall overflow it with their refluence.
         BASSO.
 Well, governor, since thou hast broke the league       By flat denial of the promis'd tribute,       Talk not of razing down your city-walls;       You shall not need trouble yourselves so far,       For Selim Calymath shall come himself,       And with brass bullets batter down your towers,       And turn proud Malta to a wilderness,       For these intolerable wrongs of yours:       And so, farewell.
         FERNEZE.
 Farewell.
            [Exit BASSO.
]       And now, you men of Malta, look about,       And let's provide to welcome Calymath:       Close your port-cullis, charge your basilisks, [119]       And, as you profitably take up arms,       So now courageously encounter them,       For by this answer broken is the league,       And naught is to be look'd for now but wars,       And naught to us more welcome is than wars.
            [Exeunt.
]              Enter FRIAR JACOMO [120] and FRIAR BARNARDINE.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 O brother, brother, all the nuns are sick,       And physic will not help them! they must die.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 The abbess sent for me to be confess'd:       O, what a sad confession will there be!         FRIAR JACOMO.
 And so did fair Maria send for me:       I'll to her lodging; hereabouts she lies.
            [Exit.
]              Enter ABIGAIL.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 What, all dead, save only Abigail!         ABIGAIL.
 And I shall die too, for I feel death coming.
       Where is the friar that convers'd with me? [121]         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 O, he is gone to see the other nuns.
         ABIGAIL.
 I sent for him; but, seeing you are come,       Be you my ghostly father:  and first know,       That in this house I liv'd religiously,       Chaste, and devout, much sorrowing for my sins;       But, ere I came--         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 What then?         ABIGAIL.
 I did offend high heaven so grievously       As I am almost desperate for my sins;       And one offense torments me more than all.
       You knew Mathias and Don Lodowick?         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Yes; what of them?         ABIGAIL.
 My father did contract me to 'em both;       First to Don Lodowick:  him I never lov'd;       Mathias was the man that I held dear,       And for his sake did I become a nun.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 So:  say how was their end?         ABIGAIL.
 Both, jealous of my love, envied [122] each other;       And by my father's practice, [123] which is there            [Gives writing.
]       Set down at large, the gallants were both slain.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 O, monstrous villany!         ABIGAIL.
 To work my peace, this I confess to thee:       Reveal it not; for then my father dies.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Know that confession must not be reveal'd;       The canon-law forbids it, and the priest       That makes it known, being degraded first,       Shall be condemn'd, and then sent to the fire.
         ABIGAIL.
 So I have heard; pray, therefore, keep it close.
       Death seizeth on my heart:  ah, gentle friar,       Convert my father that he may be sav'd,       And witness that I die a Christian!            [Dies.
]         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Ay, and a virgin too; that grieves me most.
       But I must to the Jew, and exclaim on him,       And make him stand in fear of me.
              Re-enter FRIAR JACOMO.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 O brother, all the nuns are dead! let's bury them.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 First help to bury this; then go with me,       And help me to exclaim against the Jew.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Why, what has he done?         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 A thing that makes me tremble to unfold.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 What, has he crucified a child? [124]         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 No, but a worse thing: 'twas told me in shrift;       Thou know'st 'tis death, an if it be reveal'd.
       Come, let's away.
            [Exeunt.
]          ACT IV.
              Enter BARABAS [125] and ITHAMORE.
  Bells within.
         BARABAS.
 There is no music to [126] a Christian's knell:       How sweet the bells ring, now the nuns are dead,       That sound at other times like tinkers' pans!       I was afraid the poison had not wrought,       Or, though it wrought, it would have done no good,       For every year they swell, and yet they live:       Now all are dead, not one remains alive.
         ITHAMORE.
       That's brave, master:  but think you it will not be known?         BARABAS.
 How can it, if we two be secret?         ITHAMORE.
 For my part, fear you not.
         BARABAS.
 I'd cut thy throat, if I did.
         ITHAMORE.
 And reason too.
       But here's a royal monastery hard by;       Good master, let me poison all the monks.
         BARABAS.
 Thou shalt not need; for, now the nuns are dead,       They'll die with grief.
         ITHAMORE.
 Do you not sorrow for your daughter's death?         BARABAS.
 No, but I grieve because she liv'd so long,       An Hebrew born, and would become a Christian:       Cazzo, [127] diabolo!         ITHAMORE.
       Look, look, master; here come two religious caterpillars.
              Enter FRIAR JACOMO and FRIAR BARNARDINE.
         BARABAS.
 I smelt 'em ere they came.
         ITHAMORE.
 God-a-mercy, nose! [128] Come, let's begone.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Stay, wicked Jew; repent, I say, and stay.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Thou hast offended, therefore must be damn'd.
         BARABAS.
 I fear they know we sent the poison'd broth.
         ITHAMORE.
 And so do I, master; therefore speak 'em fair.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Barabas, thou hast--         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Ay, that thou hast--         BARABAS.
 True, I have money; what though I have?         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Thou art a--         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Ay, that thou art, a--         BARABAS.
 What needs all this? I know I am a Jew.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Thy daughter--         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Ay, thy daughter--         BARABAS.
 O, speak not of her! then I die with grief.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Remember that--         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Ay, remember that--         BARABAS.
 I must needs say that I have been a great usurer.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Thou hast committed--         BARABAS.
 Fornication:  but that was in another country;       And besides, the wench is dead.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Ay, but, Barabas,       Remember Mathias and Don Lodowick.
         BARABAS.
 Why, what of them?         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
       I will not say that by a forged challenge they met.
         BARABAS.
 She has confess'd, and we are both undone,       My bosom inmate! [129] but I must dissemble.
--            [Aside to ITHAMORE.
]       O holy friars, the burden of my sins       Lie heavy [130] on my soul! then, pray you, tell me,       Is't not too late now to turn Christian?       I have been zealous in the Jewish faith,       Hard-hearted to the poor, a covetous wretch,       That would for lucre's sake have sold my soul;       A hundred for a hundred I have ta'en;       And now for store of wealth may I compare       With all the Jews in Malta:  but what is wealth?       I am a Jew, and therefore am I lost.
       Would penance serve [to atone] for this my sin,       I could afford to whip myself to death,--         ITHAMORE.
 And so could I; but penance will not serve.
         BARABAS.
 To fast, to pray, and wear a shirt of hair,       And on my knees creep to Jerusalem.
       Cellars of wine, and sollars [131] full of wheat,       Warehouses stuff'd with spices and with drugs,       Whole chests of gold in bullion and in coin,       Besides, I know not how much weight in pearl       Orient and round, have I within my house;       At Alexandria merchandise untold; [132]       But yesterday two ships went from this town,       Their voyage will be worth ten thousand crowns;       In Florence, Venice, Antwerp, London, Seville,       Frankfort, Lubeck, Moscow, and where not,       Have I debts owing; and, in most of these,       Great sums of money lying in the banco;       All this I'll give to some religious house,       So I may be baptiz'd, and live therein.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 O good Barabas, come to our house!         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 O, no, good Barabas, come to our house!       And, Barabas, you know--         BARABAS.
 I know that I have highly sinn'd:       You shall convert me, you shall have all my wealth.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 O Barabas, their laws are strict!         BARABAS.
 I know they are; and I will be with you.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 They wear no shirts, and they go bare-foot too.
         BARABAS.
 Then 'tis not for me; and I am resolv'd       You shall confess me, and have all my goods.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Good Barabas, come to me.
         BARABAS.
 You see I answer him, and yet he stays;       Rid him away, and go you home with me.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 I'll be with you to-night.
         BARABAS.
 Come to my house at one o'clock this night.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 You hear your answer, and you may be gone.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Why, go, get you away.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 I will not go for thee.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 Not! then I'll make thee go.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 How! dost call me rogue?              [They fight.
]         ITHAMORE.
 Part 'em, master, part 'em.
         BARABAS.
 This is mere frailty:  brethren, be content.
--       Friar Barnardine, go you with Ithamore:       You know my mind; let me alone with him.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Why does he go to thy house? let him be gone.
 [133]         BARABAS.
 I'll give him something, and so stop his mouth.
            [Exit ITHAMORE with Friar BARNARDINE.
]       I never heard of any man but he       Malign'd the order of the Jacobins:       But do you think that I believe his words?       Why, brother, you converted Abigail;       And I am bound in charity to requite it,       And so I will.
  O Jacomo, fail not, but come.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 But, Barabas, who shall be your godfathers?       For presently you shall be shriv'd.
         BARABAS.
 Marry, the Turk [134] shall be one of my godfathers,       But not a word to any of your covent.
 [135]         FRIAR JACOMO.
 I warrant thee, Barabas.
            [Exit.
]         BARABAS.
 So, now the fear is past, and I am safe;       For he that shriv'd her is within my house:       What, if I murder'd him ere Jacomo comes?       Now I have such a plot for both their lives,       As never Jew nor Christian knew the like:       One turn'd my daughter, therefore he shall die;       The other knows enough to have my life,       Therefore 'tis not requisite he should live.
 [136]       But are not both these wise men, to suppose       That I will leave my house, my goods, and all,       To fast and be well whipt?  I'll none of that.
       Now, Friar Barnardine, I come to you:       I'll feast you, lodge you, give you fair [137] words,       And, after that, I and my trusty Turk--       No more, but so:  it must and shall be done.
 [138]              Enter ITHAMORE.
         Ithamore, tell me, is the friar asleep?         ITHAMORE.
 Yes; and I know not what the reason is,       Do what I can, he will not strip himself,       Nor go to bed, but sleeps in his own clothes:       I fear me he mistrusts what we intend.
         BARABAS.
 No; 'tis an order which the friars use:       Yet, if he knew our meanings, could he scape?         ITHAMORE.
 No, none can hear him, cry he ne'er so loud.
         BARABAS.
 Why, true; therefore did I place him there:       The other chambers open towards the street.
         ITHAMORE.
 You loiter, master; wherefore stay we thus?       O, how I long to see him shake his heels!         BARABAS.
 Come on, sirrah:       Off with your girdle; make a handsome noose.
--            [ITHAMORE takes off his girdle, and ties a noose on it.
]       Friar, awake! [139]            [They put the noose round the FRIAR'S neck.
]         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 What, do you mean to strangle me?         ITHAMORE.
 Yes, 'cause you use to confess.
         BARABAS.
 Blame not us, but the proverb,--Confess and be       hanged.
--Pull hard.
         FRIAR BARNARDINE.
 What, will you have [140] my life?         BARABAS.
 Pull hard, I say.
--You would have had my goods.
         ITHAMORE.
 Ay, and our lives too:--therefore pull amain.
            [They strangle the FRIAR.
]       'Tis neatly done, sir; here's no print at all.
         BARABAS.
 Then is it as it should be.
  Take him up.
         ITHAMORE.
 Nay, master, be ruled by me a little.
  [Takes the body,       sets it upright against the wall, and puts a staff in its hand.
]       So, let him lean upon his staff; excellent! he stands as if he       were begging of bacon.
         BARABAS.
 Who would not think but that this friar liv'd?       What time o' night is't now, sweet Ithamore?         ITHAMORE.
 Towards one.
 [141]         BARABAS.
 Then will not Jacomo be long from hence.
            [Exeunt.
]              Enter FRIAR JACOMO.
 [142]         FRIAR JACOMO.
 This is the hour wherein I shall proceed; [143]       O happy hour, wherein I shall convert       An infidel, and bring his gold into our treasury!       But soft! is not this Barnardine? it is;       And, understanding I should come this way,       Stands here o' purpose, meaning me some wrong,       And intercept my going to the Jew.
--       Barnardine!       Wilt thou not speak? thou think'st I see thee not;       Away, I'd wish thee, and let me go by:       No, wilt thou not? nay, then, I'll force my way;       And, see, a staff stands ready for the purpose.
       As thou lik'st that, stop me another time!            [Takes the staff, and strikes down the body.
]              Enter BARABAS and ITHAMORE.
         BARABAS.
 Why, how now, Jacomo! what hast thou done?         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Why, stricken him that would have struck at me.
         BARABAS.
 Who is it? Barnardine! now, out, alas, he is slain!         ITHAMORE.
 Ay, master, he's slain; look how his brains drop out       on's [144] nose.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Good sirs, I have done't:  but nobody knows it but       you two; I may escape.
         BARABAS.
 So might my man and I hang with you for company.
         ITHAMORE.
 No; let us bear him to the magistrates.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Good Barabas, let me go.
         BARABAS.
 No, pardon me; the law must have his course:       I must be forc'd to give in evidence,       That, being importun'd by this Barnardine       To be a Christian, I shut him out,       And there he sate:  now I, to keep my word,       And give my goods and substance to your house,       Was up thus early, with intent to go       Unto your friary, because you stay'd.
         ITHAMORE.
 Fie upon 'em! master, will you turn Christian, when       holy friars turn devils and murder one another?         BARABAS.
 No; for this example I'll remain a Jew:       Heaven bless me! what, a friar a murderer!       When shall you see a Jew commit the like?         ITHAMORE.
 Why, a Turk could ha' done no more.
         BARABAS.
 To-morrow is the sessions; you shall to it.
--       Come, Ithamore, let's help to take him hence.
         FRIAR JACOMO.
 Villains, I am a sacred person; touch me not.
         BARABAS.
 The law shall touch you; we'll but lead you, we:       'Las, I could weep at your calamity!--       Take in the staff too, for that must be shown:       Law wills that each particular be known.
            [Exeunt.
]              Enter BELLAMIRA [145] and PILIA-BORZA.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Pilia-Borza, didst thou meet with Ithamore?         PILIA-BORZA.
 I did.
         BELLAMIRA.
 And didst thou deliver my letter?         PILIA-BORZA.
 I did.
         BELLAMIRA.
 And what thinkest thou? will he come?         PILIA-BORZA.
 I think so:  and yet I cannot tell; for, at the       reading of the letter, he looked like a man of another world.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Why so?         PILIA-BORZA.
 That such a base slave as he should be saluted by       such a tall [146] man as I am, from such a beautiful dame as you.
         BELLAMIRA.
 And what said he?         PILIA-BORZA.
 Not a wise word; only gave me a nod, as who should       say, "Is it even so?" and so I left him, being driven to a       non-plus at the critical aspect of my terrible countenance.
         BELLAMIRA.
 And where didst meet him?         PILIA-BORZA.
 Upon mine own free-hold, within forty foot of the       gallows, conning his neck-verse, [147] I take it, looking of [148]       a friar's execution; whom I saluted with an old hempen proverb,       Hodie tibi, cras mihi, and so I left him to the mercy of the       hangman:  but, the exercise [149] being done, see where he comes.
              Enter ITHAMORE.
         ITHAMORE.
 I never knew a man take his death so patiently as       this friar; he was ready to leap off ere the halter was about       his neck; and, when the hangman had put on his hempen tippet,       he made such haste to his prayers, as if he had had another       cure to serve.
  Well, go whither he will, I'll be none of his       followers in haste:  and, now I think on't, going to the       execution, a fellow met me with a muschatoes [150] like a raven's       wing, and a dagger with a hilt like a warming-pan; and he gave       me a letter from one Madam Bellamira, saluting me in such sort       as if he had meant to make clean my boots with his lips; the       effect was, that I should come to her house:  I wonder what the       reason is; it may be she sees more in me than I can find in       myself; for she writes further, that she loves me ever since she       saw me; and who would not requite such love?  Here's her house;       and here she comes; and now would I were gone!  I am not worthy       to look upon her.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 This is the gentleman you writ to.
         ITHAMORE.
 Gentleman! he flouts me:  what gentry can be in a poor       Turk of tenpence? [151]  I'll be gone.
            [Aside.
]         BELLAMIRA.
 Is't not a sweet-faced youth, Pilia?         ITHAMORE.
 Again, sweet youth! [Aside.
]--Did not you, sir, bring       the sweet youth a letter?         PILIA-BORZA.
 I did, sir, and from this gentlewoman, who, as       myself and the rest of the family, stand or fall at your service.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Though woman's modesty should hale me back,       I can withhold no longer:  welcome, sweet love.
         ITHAMORE.
 Now am I clean, or rather foully, out of the way.
            [Aside.
]         BELLAMIRA.
 Whither so soon?         ITHAMORE.
 I'll go steal some money from my master to make me       handsome [Aside].
--Pray, pardon me; I must go see a ship       discharged.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Canst thou be so unkind to leave me thus?         PILIA-BORZA.
 An ye did but know how she loves you, sir!         ITHAMORE.
 Nay, I care not how much she loves me.
--Sweet       Bellamira, would I had my master's wealth for thy sake!         PILIA-BORZA.
 And you can have it, sir, an if you please.
         ITHAMORE.
 If 'twere above ground, I could, and would have it;       but he hides and buries it up, as partridges do their eggs,       under the earth.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 And is't not possible to find it out?         ITHAMORE.
 By no means possible.
         BELLAMIRA.
 What shall we do with this base villain, then?            [Aside to PILIA-BORZA.
]         PILIA-BORZA.
 Let me alone; do but you speak him fair.
--            [Aside to her.
]       But you know [152] some secrets of the Jew,       Which, if they were reveal'd, would do him harm.
         ITHAMORE.
 Ay, and such as--go to, no more! I'll make him [153]       send me half he has, and glad he scapes so too:  I'll write unto       him; we'll have money straight.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Send for a hundred crowns at least.
         ITHAMORE.
 Ten hundred thousand crowns.
--[writing] MASTER BARABAS,--         PILIA-BORZA.
 Write not so submissively, but threatening him.
         ITHAMORE.
 [writing] SIRRAH BARABAS, SEND ME A HUNDRED CROWNS.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Put in two hundred at least.
         ITHAMORE.
 [writing] I CHARGE THEE SEND ME THREE HUNDRED BY THIS       BEARER, AND THIS SHALL BE YOUR WARRANT:  IF YOU DO NOT--NO MORE,       BUT SO.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Tell him you will confess.
         ITHAMORE.
 [writing] OTHERWISE I'LL CONFESS ALL.
--       Vanish, and return in a twinkle.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Let me alone; I'll use him in his kind.
         ITHAMORE.
 Hang him, Jew!            [Exit PILIA-BORZA with the letter.
]         BELLAMIRA.
 Now, gentle Ithamore, lie in my lap.
--       Where are my maids? provide a cunning [154] banquet;       Send to the merchant, bid him bring me silks;       Shall Ithamore, my love, go in such rags?         ITHAMORE.
 And bid the jeweller come hither too.
         BELLAMIRA.
 I have no husband; sweet, I'll marry thee.
         ITHAMORE.
 Content:  but we will leave this paltry land,       And sail from hence to Greece, to lovely Greece;--       I'll be thy Jason, thou my golden fleece;--       Where painted carpets o'er the meads are hurl'd,       And Bacchus' vineyards overspread the world;       Where woods and forests go in goodly green;--       I'll be Adonis, thou shalt be Love's Queen;--       The meads, the orchards, and the primrose-lanes,       Instead of sedge and reed, bear sugar-canes:       Thou in those groves, by Dis above,       Shalt live with me, and be my love.
 [155]         BELLAMIRA.
 Whither will I not go with gentle Ithamore?              Re-enter PILIA-BORZA.
         ITHAMORE.
 How now! hast thou the gold [?]         PILIA-BORZA.
 Yes.
         ITHAMORE.
 But came it freely? did the cow give down her milk       freely?         PILIA-BORZA.
 At reading of the letter, he stared and stamped,       and turned aside:  I took him by the beard, [156] and looked upon       him thus; told him he were best to send it:  then he hugged and       embraced me.
         ITHAMORE.
 Rather for fear than love.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Then, like a Jew, he laughed and jeered, and told       me he loved me for your sake, and said what a faithful servant       you had been.
         ITHAMORE.
 The more villain he to keep me thus:  here's goodly       'parel, is there not?         PILIA-BORZA.
 To conclude, he gave me ten crowns.
            [Delivers the money to ITHAMORE.
]         ITHAMORE.
 But ten? I'll not leave him worth a grey groat.
  Give       me a ream of paper:  we'll have a kingdom of gold for't.
 [157]         PILIA-BORZA.
 Write for five hundred crowns.
         ITHAMORE.
 [writing] SIRRAH JEW, AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE, SEND ME       FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS, AND GIVE THE BEARER A HUNDRED.
--Tell him       I must have't.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 I warrant, your worship shall have't.
         ITHAMORE.
 And, if he ask why I demand so much, tell him I scorn       to write a line under a hundred crowns.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 You'd make a rich poet, sir.
  I am gone.
            [Exit with the letter.
]         ITHAMORE.
 Take thou the money; spend it for my sake.
         BELLAMIRA.
 'Tis not thy money, but thyself I weigh:       Thus Bellamira esteems of gold;            [Throws it aside.
]       But thus of thee.
            [Kisses him.
]         ITHAMORE.
 That kiss again!--She runs division [158] of my       lips.
  What an eye she casts on me! it twinkles like a star.
            [Aside.
]         BELLAMIRA.
 Come, my dear love, let's in and sleep together.
         ITHAMORE.
 O, that ten thousand nights were put in one, that       we might sleep seven years together afore we wake!         BELLAMIRA.
 Come, amorous wag, first banquet, and then sleep.
            [Exeunt.
]              Enter BARABAS, [159] reading a letter.
         BARABAS.
 BARABAS, SEND ME THREE HUNDRED CROWNS;--       Plain Barabas!  O, that wicked courtezan!       He was not wont to call me Barabas;--       OR ELSE I WILL CONFESS;--ay, there it goes:       But, if I get him, coupe de gorge for that.
       He sent a shaggy, tatter'd, [160] staring slave,       That, when he speaks, draws out his grisly beard,       And winds it twice or thrice about his ear;       Whose face has been a grind-stone for men's swords;       His hands are hack'd, some fingers cut quite off;       Who, when he speaks, grunts like a hog, and looks       Like one that is employ'd in catzery [161]       And cross-biting; [162] such a rogue       As is the husband to a hundred whores;       And I by him must send three hundred crowns.
       Well, my hope is, he will not stay there still;       And, when he comes--O, that he were but here!              Enter PILIA-BORZA.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Jew, I must ha' more gold.
         BARABAS.
 Why, want'st thou any of thy tale? [163]         PILIA-BORZA.
 No; but three hundred will not serve his turn.
         BARABAS.
 Not serve his turn, sir!         PILIA-BORZA.
       No, sir; and therefore I must have five hundred more.
         BARABAS.
 I'll rather----         PILIA-BORZA.
 O, good words, sir, and send it you were best! see,       there's his letter.
            [Gives letter.
]         BARABAS.
 Might he not as well come as send? pray, bid him come       and fetch it:  what he writes for you, [164] ye shall have       straight.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Ay, and the rest too, or else----         BARABAS.
 I must make this villain away [Aside].
--Please you dine       with me, sir--and you shall be most heartily poisoned.
            [Aside.
]         PILIA-BORZA.
 No, God-a-mercy.
  Shall I have these crowns?         BARABAS.
 I cannot do it; I have lost my keys.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 O, if that be all, I can pick ope your locks.
         BARABAS.
       Or climb up to my counting-house window:  you know my meaning.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 I know enough, and therefore talk not to me of       your counting-house.
  The gold! or know, Jew, it is in my power       to hang thee.
         BARABAS.
 I am betray'd.
--            [Aside.
]       'Tis not five hundred crowns that I esteem;       I am not mov'd at that:  this angers me,       That he, who knows I love him as myself,       Should write in this imperious vein.
  Why, sir,       You know I have no child, and unto whom       Should I leave all, but unto Ithamore?         PILIA-BORZA.
 Here's many words, but no crowns:  the crowns!         BARABAS.
 Commend me to him, sir, most humbly,       And unto your good mistress as unknown.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Speak, shall I have 'em, sir?         BARABAS.
 Sir, here they are.
--            [Gives money.
]       O, that I should part [165] with so much gold!--            [Aside.
]       Here, take 'em, fellow, with as good a will----       As I would see thee hang'd [Aside].
  O, love stops my breath!       Never lov'd man servant as I do Ithamore.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 I know it, sir.
         BARABAS.
 Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?         PILIA-BORZA.
 Soon enough to your cost, sir.
  Fare you well.
            [Exit.
]         BARABAS.
 Nay, to thine own cost, villain, if thou com'st!       Was ever Jew tormented as I am?       To have a shag-rag knave to come [force from me]       Three hundred crowns, and then five hundred crowns!       Well; I must seek a means to rid [166] 'em all,       And presently; for in his villany       He will tell all he knows, and I shall die for't.
       I have it:       I will in some disguise go see the slave,       And how the villain revels with my gold.
            [Exit.
]              Enter BELLAMIRA, [167] ITHAMORE, and PILIA-BORZA.
         BELLAMIRA.
 I'll pledge thee, love, and therefore drink it off.
         ITHAMORE.
 Say'st thou me so? have at it! and do you hear?            [Whispers to her.
]         BELLAMIRA.
 Go to, it shall be so.
         ITHAMORE.
 Of [168] that condition I will drink it up:       Here's to thee.
         BELLAMIRA.
 [169] Nay, I'll have all or none.
         ITHAMORE.
 There, if thou lov'st me, do not leave a drop.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Love thee! fill me three glasses.
         ITHAMORE.
 Three and fifty dozen:  I'll pledge thee.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Knavely spoke, and like a knight-at-arms.
         ITHAMORE.
 Hey, Rivo Castiliano! [170] a man's a man.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Now to the Jew.
         ITHAMORE.
 Ha! to the Jew; and send me money he [171] were best.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 What wouldst thou do, if he should send thee none?         ITHAMORE.
 Do nothing:  but I know what I know; he's a murderer.
         BELLAMIRA.
 I had not thought he had been so brave a man.
         ITHAMORE.
 You knew Mathias and the governor's son; he and I       killed 'em both, and yet never touched 'em.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 O, bravely done!         ITHAMORE.
 I carried the broth that poisoned the nuns; and he       and I, snicle hand too fast, strangled a friar.
 [172]         BELLAMIRA.
 You two alone?         ITHAMORE.
       We two; and 'twas never known, nor never shall be for me.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 This shall with me unto the governor.
            [Aside to BELLAMIRA.
]         BELLAMIRA.
 And fit it should:  but first let's ha' more gold.
--            [Aside to PILIA-BORZA.
]       Come, gentle Ithamore, lie in my lap.
         ITHAMORE.
 Love me little, love me long:  let music rumble,       Whilst I in thy incony [173] lap do tumble.
              Enter BARABAS, disguised as a French musician, with a lute,            and a nosegay in his hat.
         BELLAMIRA.
 A French musician!--Come, let's hear your skill.
         BARABAS.
 Must tuna my lute for sound, twang, twang, first.
         ITHAMORE.
 Wilt drink, Frenchman? here's to thee with a--Pox on       this drunken hiccup!         BARABAS.
 Gramercy, monsieur.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Prithee, Pilia-Borza, bid the fiddler give me the       posy in his hat there.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Sirrah, you must give my mistress your posy.
         BARABAS.
 A votre commandement, madame.
            [Giving nosegay.
]         BELLAMIRA.
 How sweet, my Ithamore, the flowers smell!         ITHAMORE.
 Like thy breath, sweetheart; no violet like 'em.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Foh! methinks they stink like a hollyhock.
 [174]         BARABAS.
 So, now I am reveng'd upon 'em all:       The scent thereof was death; I poison'd it.
            [Aside.
]         ITHAMORE.
       Play, fiddler, or I'll cut your cat's guts into chitterlings.
         BARABAS.
       Pardonnez moi, be no in tune yet:  so, now, now all be in.
         ITHAMORE.
 Give him a crown, and fill me out more wine.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 There's two crowns for thee:  play.
            [Giving money.
]         BARABAS.
 How liberally the villain gives me mine own gold!            [Aside, and then plays.
]         PILIA-BORZA.
 Methinks he fingers very well.
         BARABAS.
 So did you when you stole my gold.
            [Aside.
]         PILIA-BORZA.
 How swift he runs!         BARABAS.
 You run swifter when you threw my gold out of my window.
            [Aside.
]         BELLAMIRA.
 Musician, hast been in Malta long?         BARABAS.
 Two, three, four month, madam.
         ITHAMORE.
 Dost not know a Jew, one Barabas?         BARABAS.
 Very mush:  monsieur, you no be his man?         PILIA-BORZA.
 His man!         ITHAMORE.
 I scorn the peasant:  tell him so.
         BARABAS.
 He knows it already.
            [Aside.
]         ITHAMORE.
 'Tis a strange thing of that Jew, he lives upon       pickled grasshoppers and sauced mushrooms.
 [175]         BARABAS.
 What a slave's this! the governor feeds not as I do.
            [Aside.
]         ITHAMORE.
 He never put on clean shirt since he was circumcised.
         BARABAS.
 O rascal! I change myself twice a-day.
            [Aside.
]         ITHAMORE.
 The hat he wears, Judas left under the elder when he       hanged himself.
 [176]         BARABAS.
 'Twas sent me for a present from the Great Cham.
            [Aside.
]         PILIA-BORZA.
 A nasty [177] slave he is.
--Whither now, fiddler?         BARABAS.
 Pardonnez moi, monsieur; me [178] be no well.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Farewell, fiddler [Exit BARABAS.
] One letter more       to the Jew.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Prithee, sweet love, one more, and write it sharp.
         ITHAMORE.
 No, I'll send by word of mouth now.
       --Bid him deliver thee a thousand crowns, by the same token       that the nuns loved rice, that Friar Barnardine slept in his       own clothes; any of 'em will do it.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Let me alone to urge it, now I know the meaning.
         ITHAMORE.
 The meaning has a meaning.
  Come, let's in:       To undo a Jew is charity, and not sin.
            [Exeunt.
]          ACT V.
              Enter FERNEZE, [179] KNIGHTS, MARTIN DEL BOSCO, and OFFICERS.
         FERNEZE.
 Now, gentlemen, betake you to your arms,       And see that Malta be well fortified;       And it behoves you to be resolute;       For Calymath, having hover'd here so long,       Will win the town, or die before the walls.
         FIRST KNIGHT.
 And die he shall; for we will never yield.
              Enter BELLAMIRA and PILIA-BORZA.
         BELLAMIRA.
 O, bring us to the governor!         FERNEZE.
 Away with her! she is a courtezan.
         BELLAMIRA.
 Whate'er I am, yet, governor, hear me speak:       I bring thee news by whom thy son was slain:       Mathias did it not; it was the Jew.
         PILIA-BORZA.
 Who, besides the slaughter of these gentlemen,       Poison'd his own daughter and the nuns,       Strangled a friar, and I know not what       Mischief beside.
         FERNEZE.
 Had we but proof of this----         BELLAMIRA.
 Strong proof, my lord:  his man's now at my lodging,       That was his agent; he'll confess it all.
         FERNEZE.
 Go fetch him [180] straight [Exeunt OFFICERS].
       I always fear'd that Jew.
              Re-enter OFFICERS with BARABAS and ITHAMORE.
         BARABAS.
 I'll go alone; dogs, do not hale me thus.
         ITHAMORE.
       Nor me neither; I cannot out-run you, constable.
--O, my belly!         BARABAS.
 One dram of powder more had made all sure:       What a damn'd slave was I!            [Aside.
]         FERNEZE.
 Make fires, heat irons, let the rack be fetch'd.
         FIRST KNIGHT.
 Nay, stay, my lord; 't may be he will confess.
         BARABAS.
 Confess! what mean you, lords? who should confess?         FERNEZE.
 Thou and thy Turk; 'twas that slew my son.
         ITHAMORE.
 Guilty, my lord, I confess.
  Your son and Mathias       were both contracted unto Abigail: [he] forged a counterfeit       challenge.
         BARABAS.
 Who carried that challenge?         ITHAMORE.
       I carried it, I confess; but who writ it? marry, even he that       strangled Barnardine, poisoned the nuns and his own daughter.
         FERNEZE.
 Away with him! his sight is death to me.
         BARABAS.
 For what, you men of Malta? hear me speak.
       She is a courtezan, and he a thief,       And he my bondman:  let me have law;       For none of this can prejudice my life.
         FERNEZE.
 Once more, away with him!--You shall have law.
         BARABAS.
 Devils, do your worst!--I['ll] live in spite of you.
--            [Aside.
]       As these have spoke, so be it to their souls!--       I hope the poison'd flowers will work anon.

         KATHARINE.
 Was my Mathias murder'd by the Jew?       Ferneze, 'twas thy son that murder'd him.
         FERNEZE.
 Be patient, gentle madam:  it was he;       He forg'd the daring challenge made them fight.
         KATHARINE.
 Where is the Jew? where is that murderer?         FERNEZE.
 In prison, till the law has pass'd on him.
              Re-enter FIRST OFFICER.
         FIRST OFFICER.
 My lord, the courtezan and her man are dead;       So is the Turk and Barabas the Jew.
         FERNEZE.
 Dead!         FIRST OFFICER.
 Dead, my lord, and here they bring his body.
         MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
 This sudden death of his is very strange.
              Re-enter OFFICERS, carrying BARABAS as dead.
         FERNEZE.
 Wonder not at it, sir; the heavens are just;       Their deaths were like their lives; then think not of 'em.
--       Since they are dead, let them be buried:       For the Jew's body, throw that o'er the walls,       To be a prey for vultures and wild beasts.
--       So, now away and fortify the town.
              Exeunt all, leaving BARABAS on the floor.
 [181]         BARABAS.
 [rising] What, all alone! well fare, sleepy drink!       I'll be reveng'd on this accursed town;       For by my means Calymath shall enter in:       I'll help to slay their children and their wives,       To fire the churches, pull their houses down,       Take my goods too, and seize upon my lands.
       I hope to see the governor a slave,       And, rowing in a galley, whipt to death.
              Enter CALYMATH, BASSOES, [182] and TURKS.
         CALYMATH.
 Whom have we there? a spy?         BARABAS.
 Yes, my good lord, one that can spy a place       Where you may enter, and surprize the town:       My name is Barabas; I am a Jew.
         CALYMATH.
 Art thou that Jew whose goods we heard were sold       For tribute-money?         BARABAS.
 The very same, my lord:       And since that time they have hir'd a slave, my man,       To accuse me of a thousand villanies:       I was imprisoned, but scap [']d their hands.
         CALYMATH.
 Didst break prison?         BARABAS.
 No, no:       I drank of poppy and cold mandrake juice;       And being asleep, belike they thought me dead,       And threw me o'er the walls:  so, or how else,       The Jew is here, and rests at your command.
         CALYMATH.
 'Twas bravely done:  but tell me, Barabas,       Canst thou, as thou report'st, make Malta ours?         BARABAS.
 Fear not, my lord; for here, against the trench, [183]       The rock is hollow, and of purpose digg'd,       To make a passage for the running streams       And common channels [184] of the city.
       Now, whilst you give assault unto the walls,       I'll lead five hundred soldiers through the vault,       And rise with them i' the middle of the town,       Open the gates for you to enter in;       And by this means the city is your own.
         CALYMATH.
 If this be true, I'll make thee governor.
         BARABAS.
 And, if it be not true, then let me die.
         CALYMATH.
 Thou'st doom'd thyself.
--Assault it presently.

  Enter CALYMATH, [185] BASSOES, TURKS, and            BARABAS; with FERNEZE and KNIGHTS prisoners.
         CALYMATH.
 Now vail [186] your pride, you captive Christians,       And kneel for mercy to your conquering foe:       Now where's the hope you had of haughty Spain?       Ferneze, speak; had it not been much better       To kept [187] thy promise than be thus surpris'd?         FERNEZE.
 What should I say? we are captives, and must yield.
         CALYMATH.
 Ay, villains, you must yield, and under Turkish yokes       Shall groaning bear the burden of our ire:--       And, Barabas, as erst we promis'd thee,       For thy desert we make thee governor;       Use them at thy discretion.
         BARABAS.
 Thanks, my lord.
         FERNEZE.
 O fatal day, to fall into the hands       Of such a traitor and unhallow'd Jew!       What greater misery could heaven inflict?         CALYMATH.
 'Tis our command:--and, Barabas, we give,       To guard thy person, these our Janizaries:       Entreat [188] them well, as we have used thee.
--       And now, brave bassoes, [189] come; we'll walk about       The ruin'd town, and see the wreck we made.
--       Farewell, brave Jew, farewell, great Barabas!         BARABAS.
 May all good fortune follow Calymath!            [Exeunt CALYMATH and BASSOES.
]       And now, as entrance to our safety,       To prison with the governor and these       Captains, his consorts and confederates.
         FERNEZE.
 O villain! heaven will be reveng'd on thee.
         BARABAS.
 Away! no more; let him not trouble me.
            [Exeunt TURKS with FERNEZE and KNIGHTS.
]       Thus hast thou gotten, [190] by thy policy,       No simple place, no small authority:       I now am governor of Malta; true,--       But Malta hates me, and, in hating me,       My life's in danger; and what boots it thee,       Poor Barabas, to be the governor,       Whenas [191] thy life shall be at their command?       No, Barabas, this must be look'd into;       And, since by wrong thou gott'st authority,       Maintain it bravely by firm policy;       At least, unprofitably lose it not;       For he that liveth in authority,       And neither gets him friends nor fills his bags,       Lives like the ass that Aesop speaketh of,       That labours with a load of bread and wine,       And leaves it off to snap on thistle-tops:       But Barabas will be more circumspect.
       Begin betimes; Occasion's bald behind:       Slip not thine opportunity, for fear too late       Thou seek'st for much, but canst not compass it.
--       Within here! [192]              Enter FERNEZE, with a GUARD.
         FERNEZE.
 My lord?         BARABAS.
 Ay, LORD; thus slaves will learn.
       Now, governor,--stand by there, wait within,--            [Exeunt GUARD.
]       This is the reason that I sent for thee:       Thou seest thy life and Malta's happiness       Are at my arbitrement; and Barabas       At his discretion may dispose of both:       Now tell me, governor, and plainly too,       What think'st thou shall become of it and thee?         FERNEZE.
 This, Barabas; since things are in thy power,       I see no reason but of Malta's wreck,       Nor hope of thee but extreme cruelty:       Nor fear I death, nor will I flatter thee.
         BARABAS.
 Governor, good words; be not so furious       'Tis not thy life which can avail me aught;       Yet you do live, and live for me you shall:       And as for Malta's ruin, think you not       'Twere slender policy for Barabas       To dispossess himself of such a place?       For sith, [193] as once you said, within this isle,       In Malta here, that I have got my goods,       And in this city still have had success,       And now at length am grown your governor,       Yourselves shall see it shall not be forgot;       For, as a friend not known but in distress,       I'll rear up Malta, now remediless.
         FERNEZE.
 Will Barabas recover Malta's loss?       Will Barabas be good to Christians?         BARABAS.
 What wilt thou give me, governor, to procure       A dissolution of the slavish bands       Wherein the Turk hath yok'd your land and you?       What will you give me if I render you       The life of Calymath, surprise his men,       And in an out-house of the city shut       His soldiers, till I have consum'd 'em all with fire?       What will you give him that procureth this?         FERNEZE.
 Do but bring this to pass which thou pretendest,       Deal truly with us as thou intimatest,       And I will send amongst the citizens,       And by my letters privately procure       Great sums of money for thy recompense:       Nay, more, do this, and live thou governor still.
         BARABAS.
 Nay, do thou this, Ferneze, and be free:       Governor, I enlarge thee; live with me;       Go walk about the city, see thy friends:       Tush, send not letters to 'em; go thyself,       And let me see what money thou canst make:       Here is my hand that I'll set Malta free;       And thus we cast [194] it:  to a solemn feast       I will invite young Selim Calymath,       Where be thou present, only to perform       One stratagem that I'll impart to thee,       Wherein no danger shall betide thy life,       And I will warrant Malta free for ever.
         FERNEZE.
 Here is my hand; believe me, Barabas,       I will be there, and do as thou desirest.
       When is the time?         BARABAS.
 Governor, presently;       For Calymath, when he hath view'd the town,       Will take his leave, and sail toward Ottoman.
         FERNEZE.
 Then will I, Barabas, about this coin,       And bring it with me to thee in the evening.
         BARABAS.
 Do so; but fail not:  now farewell, Ferneze:--            [Exit FERNEZE.
]       And thus far roundly goes the business:       Thus, loving neither, will I live with both,       Making a profit of my policy;       And he from whom my most advantage comes,       Shall be my friend.
       This is the life we Jews are us'd to lead;       And reason too, for Christians do the like.
       Well, now about effecting this device;       First, to surprise great Selim's soldiers,       And then to make provision for the feast,       That at one instant all things may be done:       My policy detests prevention.
       To what event my secret purpose drives,       I know; and they shall witness with their lives.
            [Exeunt.
]              Enter CALYMATH and BASSOES.
 [195]         CALYMATH.
 Thus have we view'd the city, seen the sack,       And caus'd the ruins to be new-repair'd,       Which with our bombards' shot and basilisk[s] [196]       We rent in sunder at our entry:       And, now I see the situation,       And how secure this conquer'd island stands,       Environ'd with the Mediterranean sea,       Strong-countermin'd with other petty isles,       And, toward Calabria, [197] back'd by Sicily       (Where Syracusian Dionysius reign'd),       Two lofty turrets that command the town,       I wonder how it could be conquer'd thus.
              Enter a MESSENGER.
         MESSENGER.
 From Barabas, Malta's governor, I bring       A message unto mighty Calymath:       Hearing his sovereign was bound for sea,       To sail to Turkey, to great Ottoman,       He humbly would entreat your majesty       To come and see his homely citadel,       And banquet with him ere thou leav'st the isle.
         CALYMATH.
 To banquet with him in his citadel!       I fear me, messenger, to feast my train       Within a town of war so lately pillag'd,       Will be too costly and too troublesome:       Yet would I gladly visit Barabas,       For well has Barabas deserv'd of us.
         MESSENGER.
 Selim, for that, thus saith the governor,--       That he hath in [his] store a pearl so big,       So precious, and withal so orient,       As, be it valu'd but indifferently,       The price thereof will serve to entertain       Selim and all his soldiers for a month;       Therefore he humbly would entreat your highness       Not to depart till he has feasted you.
         CALYMATH.
 I cannot feast my men in Malta-walls,       Except he place his tables in the streets.
         MESSENGER.
 Know, Selim, that there is a monastery       Which standeth as an out-house to the town;       There will he banquet them; but thee at home,       With all thy bassoes and brave followers.
         CALYMATH.
 Well, tell the governor we grant his suit;       We'll in this summer-evening feast with him.
         MESSENGER.
 I shall, my lord.
            [Exit.
]         CALYMATH.
 And now, bold bassoes, let us to our tents,       And meditate how we may grace us best,       To solemnize our governor's great feast.

 Rather than thus to live as Turkish thralls,       What will we not adventure?         FERNEZE.

 Leave nothing loose, all levell'd to my mind.
       Why, now I see that you have art, indeed:       There, carpenters, divide that gold amongst you;            [Giving money.

         FIRST CARPENTER.
 We shall, my lord, and thank you.
            [Exeunt CARPENTERS.
]         BARABAS.
 And, if you like them, drink your fill and die;       For, so I live, perish may all the world!       Now, Selim Calymath, return me word       That thou wilt come, and I am satisfied.
              Enter MESSENGER.
         Now, sirrah; what, will he come?         MESSENGER.
 He will; and has commanded all his men       To come ashore, and march through Malta-streets,       That thou mayst feast them in thy citadel.
         BARABAS.
 Then now are all things as my wish would have 'em;       There wanteth nothing but the governor's pelf;       And see, he brings it.
              Enter FERNEZE.
                                 Now, governor, the sum?         FERNEZE.
 With free consent, a hundred thousand pounds.
         BARABAS.
 Pounds say'st thou, governor? well, since it is no more,       I'll satisfy myself with that; nay, keep it still,       For, if I keep not promise, trust not me:       And, governor, now partake my policy.
       First, for his army, they are sent before,       Enter'd the monastery, and underneath       In several places are field-pieces pitch'd,       Bombards, whole barrels full of gunpowder,       That on the sudden shall dissever it,       And batter all the stones about their ears,       Whence none can possibly escape alive:       Now, as for Calymath and his consorts,       Here have I made a dainty gallery,       The floor whereof, this cable being cut,       Doth fall asunder, so that it doth sink       Into a deep pit past recovery.
       Here, hold that knife; and, when thou seest he comes,            [Throws down a knife.
]       And with his bassoes shall be blithely set,       A warning-piece shall be shot off [202] from the tower,       To give thee knowledge when to cut the cord,       And fire the house.
  Say, will not this be brave?         FERNEZE.
 O, excellent! here, hold thee, Barabas;       I trust thy word; take what I promis'd thee.
         BARABAS.
 No, governor; I'll satisfy thee first;       Thou shalt not live in doubt of any thing.
       Stand close, for here they come.
            [FERNEZE retires.
]                                         Why, is not this       A kingly kind of trade, to purchase towns       By treachery, and sell 'em by deceit?       Now tell me, worldlings, underneath the sun [203]       If greater falsehood ever has been done?              Enter CALYMATH and BASSOES.
         CALYMATH.
 Come, my companion-bassoes:  see, I pray,       How busy Barabas is there above       To entertain us in his gallery:       Let us salute him.
--Save thee, Barabas!         BARABAS.
 Welcome, great Calymath!         FERNEZE.
 How the slave jeers at him!            [Aside.
]         BARABAS.
 Will't please thee, mighty Selim Calymath,       To ascend our homely stairs?         CALYMATH.
 Ay, Barabas.
--       Come, bassoes, ascend.
 [204]         FERNEZE.
 [coming forward] Stay, Calymath;       For I will shew thee greater courtesy       Than Barabas would have afforded thee.
         KNIGHT.
 [within] Sound a charge there!            [A charge sounded within:  FERNEZE cuts the cord; the floor            of the gallery gives way, and BARABAS falls into a caldron            placed in a pit.
              Enter KNIGHTS and MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
 [205]         CALYMATH.
 How now! what means this?         BARABAS.
 Help, help me, Christians, help!         FERNEZE.
 See, Calymath! this was devis'd for thee.
         CALYMATH.
 Treason, treason! bassoes, fly!         FERNEZE.
 No, Selim, do not fly:       See his end first, and fly then if thou canst.
         BARABAS.
 O, help me, Selim! help me, Christians!       Governor, why stand you all so pitiless?         FERNEZE.
 Should I in pity of thy plaints or thee,       Accursed Barabas, base Jew, relent?       No, thus I'll see thy treachery repaid,       But wish thou hadst behav'd thee otherwise.
         BARABAS.
 You will not help me, then?         FERNEZE.
 No, villain, no.
         BARABAS.
 And, villains, know you cannot help me now.
--       Then, Barabas, breathe forth thy latest fate,       And in the fury of thy torments strive       To end thy life with resolution.
--       Know, governor, 'twas I that slew thy son,--       I fram'd the challenge that did make them meet:       Know, Calymath, I aim'd thy overthrow:       And, had I but escap'd this stratagem,       I would have brought confusion on you all,       Damn'd Christian [206] dogs, and Turkish infidels!       But now begins the extremity of heat       To pinch me with intolerable pangs:       Die, life! fly, soul! tongue, curse thy fill, and die!            [Dies.
]         CALYMATH.
 Tell me, you Christians, what doth this portend?         FERNEZE.
 This train [207] he laid to have entrapp'd thy life;       Now, Selim, note the unhallow'd deeds of Jews;       Thus he determin'd to have handled thee,       But I have rather chose to save thy life.
         CALYMATH.
 Was this the banquet he prepar'd for us?       Let's hence, lest further mischief be pretended.
 [208]         FERNEZE.
 Nay, Selim, stay; for, since we have thee here,       We will not let thee part so suddenly:       Besides, if we should let thee go, all's one,       For with thy galleys couldst thou not get hence,       Without fresh men to rig and furnish them.
         CALYMATH.
 Tush, governor, take thou no care for that;       My men are all aboard,       And do attend my coming there by this.
         FERNEZE.
 Why, heard'st thou not the trumpet sound a charge?         CALYMATH.
 Yes, what of that?         FERNEZE.
 Why, then the house was fir'd,       Blown up, and all thy soldiers massacred.
         CALYMATH.
 O, monstrous treason!         FERNEZE.
 A Jew's courtesy;       For he that did by treason work our fall,       By treason hath deliver'd thee to us:       Know, therefore, till thy father hath made good       The ruins done to Malta and to us,       Thou canst not part; for Malta shall be freed,       Or Selim ne'er return to Ottoman.
         CALYMATH.
 Nay, rather, Christians, let me go to Turkey,       In person there to mediate [209] your peace:       To keep me here will naught advantage you.
         FERNEZE.
 Content thee, Calymath, here thou must stay,       And live in Malta prisoner; for come all [210] the world       To rescue thee, so will we guard us now,       As sooner shall they drink the ocean dry,       Than conquer Malta, or endanger us.
       So, march away; and let due praise be given       Neither to Fate nor Fortune, but to Heaven.

 "What Kind of Shoes Are the Shoes You Wear?"    "What makes you wear such funny shoes?"    Linda Strong thrust forward a foot and critically examined the narrow  vamp, the projecting sole, the broad, low heel of her well-worn brown  calfskin shoe.
 Then her glance lifted to the face of Donald Whiting, one  of the most brilliant and popular seniors of the high school.
 Her eyes  narrowed in a manner habitual to her when thinking intently.
    "Never you mind my shoes," she said deliberately.
 "Kindly fix your  attention on my head piece.
 When you see me allowing any Jap in my class  to make higher grades than I do, then I give you leave to say anything  you please concerning my head.
"    An angry red rushed to the boy's face.
 It was an irritating fact that in  the senior class of that particular Los Angeles high school a Japanese  boy stood at the head.
 This was embarrassing to every senior.
    "I say," said Donald Whiting, "I call that a mean thrust.
"    "I have a particular reason," said Linda.
    "And I have 'a particular reason'," said Donald, "for being interested  in your shoes.
"    Linda laughed suddenly.
 When Linda laughed, which was very seldom, those  within hearing turned to look at her.
 Hers was not a laugh that can be  achieved.
 There were a few high places on the peak of Linda's soul, and  on one of them homed a small flock of notes of rapture; notes as sweet  as the voice of the white-banded mockingbird of Argentina.
    "How surprising!" exclaimed Linda.
 "We have been attending the same  school for three years; now, you stop me suddenly to tell me that you  are interested in the shape of my shoes.
"    "I have been watching them all the time," said Donald.
 "Can't understand  why any girl wants to be so different.
 Why don't you dress your hair the  same as the other girls and wear the same kind of clothes and shoes?"    "Now look here," interposed Linda "You are flying the track.
I am willing  to justify my shoes, if I can, but here you go including my dress and a  big psychological problem, as well; but I think perhaps the why of the  shoes will explain the remainder.
 Does the name 'Alexander Strong' mean  anything to you?"    "The great nerve specialist?" asked Donald.
    "Yes," said Linda.
 "The man who was the author of half-dozen books  that have been translated into many foreign tongue' and are used as  authorities all over the world.
 He happened to be my father There are  two children in our family.
 I have a sister four years older than I am  who is exactly like Mother, and she and Mother were inseparable.
 I am  exactly like Father; because we understood each other, and because both  of us always new, although we never mentioned it; that Mother preferred  my sister Eileen to me, Father tried to make it up to me, so from the  time I can remember I was at his heels.
 It never bothered him to have me  playing around in the library while he was writing his most complicated  treatise.
 I have waited in his car half a day at a time, playing or  reading, while he watched a patient or delivered a lecture at some  medical college.
 His mental relaxation was to hike or to motor to the  sea, to the mountains, to the canyons or the desert, and he very seldom  went without me even on long trips when he was fishing or hunting with  other men.
 There was not much to know concerning a woman's frame or he  psychology that Father did not know, so there were two reason why he  selected my footwear as he did.
 One was because he be believed high  heels and pointed toes an outrage against the nervous province, and the  other was that I could not possibly have kept pace with him except in  shoes like these.
 No doubt, they are the same kind I shall wear all my  life, for walking.
 You probably don't know it, but my home lies near the  middle of Lilac Valley and I walk over a mile each morning and evening  to and from the cars.
 Does this sufficiently explain my shoes?"    "I should think you'd feel queer," said Donald.
    "I suspect I would if I had time to brood over it," Linda replied, "but  I haven't.
 I must hustle to get to school on time in the morning.
 It's  nearly or quite dark before I reach home in the evening.
 My father  believed in having a good time.
 He had superb health, so he spent most  of what he made as it came to him.
 He counted on a long life.
 It never  occurred to him that a little piece of machinery going wrong would  plunge him into Eternity in a second.
"    "Oh, I remember!" cried the boy.
    Linda's face paled slightly.
    "Yes," she said, "it happened four years ago and I haven't gotten away  from the horror of it yet, enough ever to step inside of a motor car;  but I am going to get over that one of these days.
 Brakes are not all  defective, and one must take one's risks.
"    "You just bet I would," said Donald.
 "Motoring is one of the greatest  pleasures of modern life.
 I'll wager it makes some of the gay old boys,  like Marcus Aurelius for example, want to turn over in their graves when  they see us flying along the roads of California the way we do.
"    "What I was getting at," said Linda, "was a word of reply to the  remainder of your indictment against me.
 Dad's income stopped with him,  and household expenses went on, and war came, so there isn't enough  money to dress two of us as most of the high school girls are dressed.
  Eileen is so much older that it's her turn first, and I must say she is  not at all backward about exercising her rights.
 I think that will  have to suffice for the question of dress but you may be sure that I am  capable of wearing the loveliest dress imaginable, that would be for a  school girl, if I had it to wear.
"    "Ah, there's the little 'fly in your ointment'--'dress that would be  suitable.
' I bet in your heart you think the dresses that half the girls  in high school are wearing are NOT SUITABLE!"    "Commendable perspicacity, O learned senior," said Linda, "and amazingly  true.
 In the few short years I had with Daddy I acquired a fixed idea as  to what kind of dress is suitable and sufficiently durable to wear while  walking my daily two miles.
 I can't seem to become reconciled to the  custom of dressing the same for school as for a party.
 You get my idea?"    "I get it all right enough," said Donald, "but I must think awhile  before I decide whether I agree with you.
 Why should you be right, and  hundreds of other girls be wrong?"    "I'll wager your mother would agree with me," suggested Linda.
    "Did yours?" asked Donald.
    "Halfway," answered Linda.
 "She agreed with me for me, but not for  Eileen.
"    "And not for my sister," said Donald.
 "She wears the very foxiest  clothes that Father can afford to pay for, and when she was going to  school she wore them without the least regard as to whether she was  going to school or to a tea party or a matinee.
 For that matter she  frequently went to all three the same day.
    "And that brings us straight to the point concerning you," said Linda.
    "Sure enough!" said Donald.
 "There is me to be considered! What is it  you have against me?"    Linda looked at him meditatively.
    "You SEEM exceptionally strong," she said.
 "No doubt are good in  athletics.
 Your head looks all right; it indicates brains.
 What I want  to know is why in the world you don't us them.
"    "What are you getting at, anyway?" asked Donald, with more than a hint  of asperity in his voice.
    "I am getting at the fact," said Linda, "that a boy as big as you and as  strong as you and with as good brain and your opportunity has allowed  a little brown Jap to cross the Pacific Ocean and a totally strange  country to learn a language foreign to him, and, and, with the same  books and the same chances, to beat you at your own game.
 You and every  other boy in your classes ought to thoroughly ashamed of yourselves.
  Before I would let a Jap, either boy or girl, lead in my class, I would  give up going to school and go out and see if I could beat him growing  lettuce and spinach.
"    "It's all very well to talk," said Donald hotly.
    "And it's better to make good what you say," broke in Linda, with equal  heat.
 "There are half a dozen Japs in my classes but no one of them is  leading, you will notice, if I do wear peculiar shoes.
"    "Well, you would be going some if you beat the leading Jap in the senior  class," said Donald.
    "Then I would go some," said Linda.
 "I'd beat him, or I'd go straight up  trying.
 You could do it if you'd make up your mind to.
 The trouble with  you is that you're wasting your brain on speeding an automobile, on  dances, and all sorts of foolishness that is not doing you any good in  any particular way.
 Bet you are developing nerves smoking cigarettes.
  You are not concentrating.
 Oka Sayye is not thinking of a thing except  the triumph of proving to California that he is head man in one of the  Los Angeles high schools.
 That's what I have got against you, and every  other white boy in your class, and in the long run it stacks up bigger  than your arraignment of my shoes.
"    "Oh, darn your shoes!" cried Donald hotly.
 "Forget 'em! I've got to move  on or I'll be late for trigonometry, but I don't know when I've had such  a tidy little fight with a girl, and I don't enjoy feeling that I have  been worsted.
 I propose another session.
 May I come out to Lilac  Valley Saturday afternoon and flay you alive to pay up for my present  humiliation?"    "Why, if your mother happened to be motoring that way and would care to  call, I think that would be fine," said Linda.
    "Well, for the Lord's sake!" exclaimed the irate senior.
 "Can't a fellow  come and fight with you without being refereed by his mother? Shall I  bring Father too?"    "I only thought," said Linda quietly, "that you would like your mother  to see the home and environment of any girl whose acquaintance you made,  but the fight we have coming will in all probability be such a pitched  battle that when I go over the top, you won't ever care to follow me and  start another issue on the other side.
 You're dying right now to ask why  I wear my hair in braids down my back instead of in cootie coops over my  ears.
"    "I don't give a hang," said Donald ungallantly, "as to how you; wear  your hair, but I am coming Saturday to fight, and I don't think Mother  will take any greater interest in the matter than to know that I am  going to do battle with a daughter of Doctor I Strong.
"    "That is a very nice compliment to my daddy, thank you, said Linda,  turning away and proceeding in the direction of her own classrooms.
  There was a brilliant sparkle in her eyes and she sang in a muffled  voice, yet distinctly enough to be heard:    "The shoes I wear are common-sense shoes, And you may wear them if you  choose.
"    "By gracious! She's no fool," he said to himself.
 In three minutes'  unpremeditated talk the "Junior Freak," as he mentally denominated her,  had managed to irritate him, to puncture his pride, to entertain and  amuse him.
    "I wonder--" he said as he went his way; and all day he kept on  wondering, when he was not studying harder than ever before in all his  life.
    That night Linda walked slowly along the road toward home.
 She was  not seeing the broad stretch of Lilac Valley, on every hand green with  spring, odorous with citrus and wild bloom, blue walled with lacy lilacs  veiling the mountain face on either side; and she was not thinking  of her plain, well-worn dress or her common-sense shoes.
 What she was  thinking was of every flaying, scathing, solidly based argument she  could produce the following Saturday to spur Donald Whiting in some way  to surpass Oka Sayye.
 His chance remark that morning, as they stood near  each other waiting a few minutes in the hall, had ended in his asking to  come to see her, and she decided as she walked homeward that his first  visit in all probability would be his last, since she had not time to  spare for boys, when she had so many different interests involved; but  she did decide very finely in her own mind that the would make that  visit a memorable one for him.
    In arriving at this decision her mind traveled a number of devious  roads.
 The thought that she had been criticized did not annoy her as to  the kind of criticism, but she did resent the quality of truth about it.
  She was right in following the rules her father had laid down for her  health and physical well-being, but was it right that she should wear  shoes scuffed, resoled, and even patched, when there was money enough  for Eileen to have many pairs of expensive laced boots, walking shoes,  and fancy slippers? She was sure she was right in wearing dresses  suitable for school, but was it right that she must wear them until  they were sunfaded, stained, and disreputable? Was it right that Eileen  should occupy their father and mother's suite, redecorated and daintily  furnished according to her own taste, to keep the parts of the house  that she cared to use decorated with flowers and beautifully appointed,  while Linda must lock herself in a small stuffy bedroom room, dingy and  none too comfortable, when in deference to her pride she wished to work  in secret until she learned whether she could succeed.
    Then she began thinking, and decided that the only available place in  the house for her use was the billiard room.
 She made up her mind that  she would demand the sole right to this big attic room.
 She would sell  the table and use the money to buy herself a suitable worktable and  a rug.
 She would demand that Eileen produce enough money for better  clothing for her, and then she remembered what she had said to Donald  Whiting about conquering her horror for a motor car.
 Linda turned in  at the walk leading to her home, but she passed the front entrance and  followed around to the side.
 As she went she could hear voices in the  living room and she knew that Eileen was entertaining some of her  many friends; for Eileen was that peculiar creature known as a social  butterfly.
 Each day of her life friends came; or Eileen went--mostly  the latter, for Eileen had a knack of management and she so managed  her friends that, without their realizing it, they entertained her many  times while she entertained them once.
 Linda went to the kitchen, Laid  her books and package of mail on the table, and, walking over to the  stove, she proceeded deliberately and heartily to kiss the cook.
    "Katy, me darlin'," she said, "look upon your only child.
 Do you notice  a 'lean and hungry look' on her classic features?"    Katy turned adoring eyes to the young girl.
    "It's growing so fast ye are, childie," she said.
 "It's only a little  while to dinner, and there's company tonight, so hadn't ye better wait  and not spoil your appetite with piecing?"    "Is there going to be anything 'jarvis'?" inquired Linda.
    '"I'd say there is," said Katy.
 "John Gilman is here and two friends of  Eileen's.
 It's a near banquet, lassie.
"    "Then I'll wait," said Linda.
 "I want the keys to the garage.
"    Katy handed them to her and Linda went down the back walk beneath an  arch of tropical foliage, between blazing walls of brilliant flower  faces, unlocked the garage, and stood looking at her father's runabout.
    In the revolution that had taken place in their home after the passing  of their father and mother, Eileen had dominated the situation and done  as she pleased, with the exception of two instances.
 Linda had shown  both temper and determination at the proposal to dismantle the library  and dispose of the cars.
 She had told Eileen that she might take the  touring car and do as she pleased with it.
 For her share she wanted  her father's roadster, and she meant to have it.
 She took the same firm  stand concerning the Library.
 With the rest of the house Eileen might do  as she would.
 The library was to remain absolutely untouched and what it  contained was Linda's.
 To this Eileen had agreed, but so far Linda had  been content merely to possess her property.
    Lately, driven by the feeling that she must find a way in which she  could earn money, she had been secretly working on some plans that she  hoped might soon yield her small returns.
 As for the roadster, she as  well as Eileen had been horror-stricken when the car containing their  father and mother and their adjoining neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Thorne,  driven by Marian Thorne, the playmate and companion from childhood  of the Strong girls, had become uncontrollable and plunged down the  mountain in a disaster that had left only Marian, protected by the  steering gear, alive.
 They had simply by mutual agreement begun using  the street cars when they wanted to reach the city.
    Linda stood looking at the roadster, jacked up and tucked under a  heavy canvas tent that she and her father had used on their hunting and  fishing trips.
 After a long time she laid strong hands on the canvas and  dragged it to one side.
 She looked the car over carefully and then, her  face very white and her hands trembling, she climbed into it and slowly  and mechanically went through the motions of starting it.
 For another  intent period she sat with her hands on the steering gear, staring  straight ahead, and then she said slowly: "Something has got to be done.
  It's not going to be very agreeable, but I am going to do it.
 Eileen:  has had things all her own way long enough.
 I am getting such a big girl  I ought to have a few things in my life as I want them.
 Something must  be done.
"    Then Linda proceeded to do something.
 What she did was to lean forward,  rest her head upon the steering wheel and fight to keep down deep,  pitiful sobbing until her whole slender body twisted in the effort.
    She was yielding to a breaking up after four years of endurance, for the  greater part in silence.
 As the months of the past year had rolled their  deliberate way, Linda had begun to realize that the course her elder  sister had taken was wholly unfair to her, and slowly a tumult of revolt  was growing in her soul.
 Without a doubt the culmination had resulted  from her few minutes' talk with Donald Whiting in the hall that morning.
  It had started Linda to thinking deeply, and the more deeply she thought  the clearly she saw the situation.
 Linda was a loyal soul and her heart  was honest.
 She was quite willing that Eileen should: exercise her  rights as head of the family, that she should take the precedence to  which she was entitled by her four years' seniority, that she should  spend the money which accrued monthly from their father's estate as she  saw fit, up to a certain point.
 That point was where things ceased to  be fair or to be just.
 If there had been money to do no more for Eileen  than had been done for Linda, it would not have been in Linda's heart  to utter a complaint.
 She could have worn scuffed shoes and old dresses,  and gone her way with her proud young head held very high and a jest on  her lips; but when her mind really fastened on the problem and she began  to reason, she could not feel that Eileen was just to her or that she  was fair in her administration of the money which should have been  divided more nearly equally between them, after the household expenses  had been paid.
 Once rebellion burned in her heart the flames leaped  rapidly, and Linda began to remember a thousand small things that she  had scarcely noted at the time of their occurrence.
    She was leaning on the steering wheel, tired with nerve strain, when she  heard Katy calling her, and realized that she was needed in the kitchen.
  As a matter of economy Eileen, after her parents' passing, had dismissed  the housemaid, and when there were guests before whom she wished to make  a nice appearance Linda had been impressed either to wait on the table  or to help in the kitchen in order that Katy might attend the dining  room, so Linda understood what was wanted when Katy called her.
 She ran  her fingers over the steering wheel, worn bright by the touch of her  father's and her own hands, and with the buoyancy of youth, found  comfort.
 Once more she mechanically went through the motions of starting  the car, then she stepped down, closed the door, and stood an instant  thinking.
    "You're four years behind the times," she said slowly.
 "No doubt there's  a newer and a better model; I suspect the tires are rotten, but the  last day I drove you for Daddy you purred like a kitten, and ran like  a clock, and if you were cleaned and oiled and put in proper shape,  there's no reason in the world why I should not drive you again, as I  have driven you hundreds of miles when Daddy was tired or when he wanted  to teach me the rules of good motoring, and the laws of the road.
 I can  do it all right.
 I have got to do it, but it will be some time before  I'll care to tackle the mountains.
"    Leaving the cover on the floor, she locked the door and returned to the  kitchen.
    "All right, Katy, what is the programme?" she inquired as lightly as she  could.
    Katy had been cook in the Strong family ever since they had moved to  Lilac Valley.
 She had obeyed Mrs. Strong and Eileen.
 She had worshiped  the Doctor and Linda It always had been patent to her eyes that Mrs.  Strong was extremely partial to Eileen, so Katy had joined forces with  the Doctor in surreptitiously doing everything her warm Irish heart  prompted to prevent Linda from feeling neglected.
 Her quick eyes saw the  traces of tears on Linda's face, and she instantly knew that the trip  the girl had made to the garage was in some way connected with some  belongings of her father's, so she said: "I am serving tonight but I  want you to keep things smoking hot and to have them dished up ready for  me so that everything will go smoothly.
"    "What would happen," inquired Linda, "if everything did NOT go smoothly?  Katy, do you think the roof would blow straight up if I had MY way about  something, just for a change?"    "No, I think the roof would stay right where it belongs," said Katy with  a chuckle, "but I do think its staying there would not be because Miss  Eileen wanted it to.
"    "Well," said Linda deliberately, "we won't waste any time on thinking  We are going to have some positive knowledge on the subject pretty  immediately.
 I don't feel equal to starting any domestic santana today,  but the forces are gathering and the blow is coming soon.
 To that I have  firmly made up my mind.
"    "It's not the least mite I'm blaming you, honey," said Katy.
    "Ye've got to be such a big girl that it's only fair things in this  house should go a good deal different.
"    "Is Marian to be here?" asked Linda as she stood beside the stove  peering into pans and kettles.
    "Miss Eileen didn't say," replied Katy.
    Linda's eyes reddened suddenly.
 She slammed down a lid with vicious  emphasis.
    "That is another deal Eileen's engineered," she said, "that is just  about as wrong as anything possibly can be.
 What makes me the maddest  about it is that John Gilman will let Eileen take him by the nose and  lead him around like a ringed calf.
 Where is his common sense? Where is  his perception? Where is his honor?"    "Now wait, dearie," said Katy soothingly, "wait.
 John Gilman is a mighty  fine man.
 Ye know how your father loved him and trusted him and gave  him charge of all his business affairs.
 Ye mustn't go so far as to be  insinuating that he is lacking in honor.
"    "No," said Linda, "that was not fair.
 I don't in the least know that he  ever ASKED Marian to marry him; but I do know that as long as he was a  struggling, threadbare young lawyer Marian was welcome to him, and they  had grand times together.
 The minute he won the big Bailey suit and came  into public notice and his practice increased until he was independent,  that minute Eileen began to take notice, and it looks to me now as if  she very nearly had him.
"    "And so far as I can see," said Katy, "Miss Marian is taking it without  a struggle.
 She is not lifting a finger or making a move to win him  back.
"    "Of course she isn't!" said Linda indignantly.
 "If she thought he  preferred some other girl to her, she would merely say: 'If John has  discovered that he likes Eileen the better, why, that is all right;  but there wouldn't be anything to prevent seeing Eileen take John from  hurting like the deuce.
 Did you ever lose a man you loved, Katy?"    "That I did not!" said Katy emphatically.
 "We didn't do any four or  five years' philanderin' to see if a man 'could make good' when I was a  youngster.
 When a girl and her laddie stood up to each other and looked  each other straight in the eye and had the great understanding, there  weren't no question of whether he could do for her what her father and  mither had been doing, nor of how much he had to earn before they would  be able to begin life together.
 They just caught hands and hot-footed it  to the praste and told him to read the banns the next Sunday, and when  the law allowed they was man and wife and taking what life had for them  the way it came, and together.
 All this philanderin' that young folks do  nowadays is just pure nonsense, and waste of time.
"    "Sure!" laughed Linda.
 "When my brave comes along with his blanket I'll  just step under, and then if anybody tries to take my man I'll have the  right to go on the warpath and have a scalping party that would be some  satisfaction to the soul.
"    Then they served the dinner, and when the guests had left the dining  room, Katy closed the doors, and brought on the delicacies she had  hidden for Linda and patted and cajoled her while she ate like any  healthy, hungry young creature.
        .
 Cotyledon of Multiflores Canyon    "'Ave, atque vale!' Cotyledon!"    Linda slid down the side of the canyon with the deftness of the expert.
  At the first available crevice she thrust in her Alpine stick, and  bracing herself, gained a footing.
 Then she turned and by use of her  fingers and toes worked her way back to the plan, she had passed.
 She  was familiar with many members of she family, but such a fine specimen  she seldom had found and she could not recall having seen it in all of  her botanies.
 Opposite the plant she worked out a footing, drove her  stick deep at the base of a rock to brace herself, and from the knapsack  on her back took a sketchbook and pencil and began rapidly copying the  thick fleshy leaves of the flattened rosette, sitting securely at the  edge of a rock.
 She worked swiftly and with breathless interest.
 When  she had finished the flower she began sketching in the moss-covered face  of the boulder against which it grew, and other bits of vegetation near.
    "I think, Coty," she said, "it is very probable that I can come a few  simoleons with you.
 You are becoming better looking ever minute.
"    For a touch of color she margined one side of her drawing with a little  spray of Pentstemon whose bright tubular flower the canyon knew as  "hummingbird's dinner horn.
" That gave, her the idea of introducing  a touch of living interest, so bearing down upon the flowers from  the upper right-hand corner of her drawing she deftly sketched in a  ruby-throated hummingbird, and across the bottom of the sheet the lace  of a few leaves of fern.
 Then she returned the drawing and pencil to her  knapsack, and making sure of her footing, worked her way forward.
 With  her long slender fingers she began teasing the plant loose from the  rock and the surrounding soil.
 The roots penetrated deeper than she  had supposed and in her interest she forgot her precarious footing and  pulled hard.
 The plant gave way unexpectedly, and losing her balance,  Linda plunged down the side of the canyon catching wildly at shrubs and  bushes and bruising herself severely on stones, finally landing in a  sitting posture on the road that traversed the canyon.
    She was not seriously hurt, but she did not present a picturesque figure  as she sprawled in the road, her booted feet thrust straight before her,  one of her long black braids caught on a bush at her back, her blouse  pulled above her breeches, the contents of her knapsack decorating the  canyon side and the road around her; but high in one hand, without break  or blemish, she triumphantly held aloft the rare Cotyledon.
 She shrugged  her shoulders, wiggled her toes, and moved her arms to assure herself  that no bones were broken; then she glanced at her drawings and the  fruits of her day's collecting scattered on the roadside around her.
 She  was in the act of rising when a motor car containing two young men shot  around a curve of the canyon, swerved to avoid running over her, and  stopped as abruptly as possible.
    "It's a girl!" cried the driver, and both men sprang to the road  and hurried to Linda's assistance.
 Her dark cheeks were red with  mortification, but she managed to recover her feet and tuck in her  blouse before they reached her.
    "We heard you coming down," said the elder of the young men, "and we  thought you might be a bear.
 Are you sure you're not hurt?"    Linda stood before them, a lithe slender figure, vivid with youth and  vitality.
    "I am able to stand," she said, "so of course I haven't broken any  bones.
 I think I am fairly well battered, but you will please to observe  that there isn't a scratch on Cotyledon, and I brought her down--at  least I think it's she--from the edge of that boulder away up there.
  Isn't she a beauty? Only notice the delicate frosty 'bloom' on her  leaves!"    "I should prefer," said the younger of the men, "to know whether you have  any broken bones.
"    "I'm sure I am all right," answered Linda.
 "I have falling down  mountains reduced to an exact science.
 I'll bet you couldn't slide that  far and bring down Coty without a scratch.
"    "Well, which is the more precious," said the young man.
 "Yourself or  the specimen?"    "Why, the specimen!" answered Linda in impatience.
 "California is full  of girls; but this is the finest Cotyledon of this family I have ever  seen.
 Don't mistake this for any common stonecrop.
 It looks to me like  an Echeveria.
 I know what I mean to do with the picture I have made of  her, and I know exactly where she is going to grow from this day on.
"    "Is there any way we can help you?" inquired the elder of the two men.
    For the first time Linda glanced at him, and her impression was that he  was decidedly attractive.
    "No, thank you!" she answered briskly.
 "I am going to climb back up to  the boulder and collect the belongings I spilled on the way down.
 Then  I am going to carry Coty to the car line in a kind of triumphal march,  because she is the rarest find that I have ever made.
 I hope you have  no dark designs on Coty, because this is 'what the owner had to do to  redeem her.
'"    Linda indicated her trail down the canyon side, brushed soil and twigs  from her trousers, turned her straight young back, carefully set down  her specimen, and by the aid of her recovered stick began expertly  making her way up the canyon side.
 "Here, let me do that," offered the  younger man.
 "You rest until I collect your belongings.
" Linda glanced  back over her shoulder.
 "Thanks," she said.
 "I have a mental inventory  of all the pencils and knives and trowels I must find.
 You might  overlook the most important part of my paraphernalia; and really I am  not damaged.
 I'm merely hurt.
 Good-bye!"    Linda started back up the side of the canyon, leaving the young men to  enter their car and drive away.
 For a minute both of them stood watching  her.
    "What will girls be wearing and doing next?" asked the elder of the two  as he started his car.
    "What would you have a girl wear when she is occupied with coasting down  canyons?" said his friend.
 "And as for what she is doing, it's probable  that every high-school girl in Los Angeles has a botanical collection to  make before she graduates.
"    "I see!" said the man driving.
 "She is only a high-school kid, but  did you notice that she is going to make an extremely attractive young  woman?"    "Yes, I noticed just that; I noticed it very particularly," answered  the younger man.
 "And I noticed also that she either doesn't know it, or  doesn't give a flip.
"      Linda collected her belongings, straightened her hair and  clothing, and, with her knapsack in place, and leaning rather on heavily  on her walking stick, made her way down the road to the abutment of a  small rustic bridge where she stopped to rest.
 The stream at her feet  was noisy and icy cold.
 It rushed through narrow defiles in the rock,  beat itself to foam against the faces a of the big stones, fell over  jutting cliffs, spread in whispering pools, wound back and forth  across the road at its will, singing every foot of its downward way  and watering beds of crisp, cool miners' lettuce, great ferns, and  heliotrope, climbing clematis, soil and blue-eyed grass.
 All along  its length grew willows, and in a few places white-bodied sycamores.
  Everywhere over the walls red above it that vegetation could find a  footing grew mosses, vines, flowers, and shrubs.
 On the shadiest side  homed most of the ferns and the Cotyledon.
 In the sun, larkspur, lupin,  and monkey flower; everywhere wild rose, holly, mahogany, gooseberry,  and bayoneted yucca all intermingling in a curtain of variegated greens,  brocaded with flower arabesques of vivid red, white, yellow, and blue.
  Canyon wrens and vireos sang as they nested.
 The air was clear, cool,  and salty from the near-by sea.
 Myriad leaf shadows danced on the black  roadbed, level as a barn floor, and across it trailed the wavering  image of hawk and vulture, gull and white sea swallow.
 Linda studied the  canyon with intent eyes, but bruised flesh pleaded, so reluctantly she  arose, shouldered her belongings, and slowly followed the road out to  the car line that passed through Lilac Valley, still carefully bearing  in triumph the precious Cotyledon.
 An hour later she entered the  driveway of her home.
 She stopped to set her plant carefully in the wild  garden she and her father had worked all her life at collecting, then  followed the back porch and kitchen route.
    "Whatever have ye been doing to yourself, honey?" cried Katy.
    "I came a cropper down Multiflores Canyon where it is so steep that it  leans the other way.
 I pretty well pulverized myself for a pulverulent,  Katy, which is a poor joke.
"    "Now ain't that just my luck!" wailed Katy, snatching a cake cutter and  beginning hurriedly to stamp out little cakes from the dough before her.
    "Well, I don't understand in exactly what way," said Linda, absently  rubbing her elbows and her knees.
 "Seems to me it's my promontories that  have been knocked off, not yours, Katy.
"    "Yes, and ain't it just like ye," said Katy, "to be coming in late, and  all banged up when Miss Eileen has got sudden notice that there is going  to be company again and I have an especial dinner to serve, and never in  the world can I manage if ye don't help me!"    "Why, who is coming now?" asked Linda, seating herself on the nearest  chair and beginning to unfasten her boots slowly.
    "Well, first of all, there is Mr. Gilman, of course.
"    "'Of course,'" conceded Linda.
 "If he tried to get past our house,  Eileen is perfectly capable of setting it on fire to stop him.
 She's got  him 'vamped' properly.
"    "Oh I don't know that ye should say just that," said Katy "Eileen is a  mighty pretty girl, and she is SOME manager.
"    "You can stake your hilarious life she is," said Linda, viciously  kicking a boot to the center of the kitchen.
 "She can manage to go  downtown for lunch and be invited out to dinner thirteen times a week,  and leave us at home to eat bread and milk, bread heavily stressed.
  She can manage to get every cent of the income from the property in her  fingers, and a great big girl like me has to go to high school looking  so tacky that even the boys are beginning to comment on it.
 Manage, I'll  say she can manage, not to mention managing to snake John Gilman right  out of Marian's fingers.
 I doubt if Marian fully realizes yet that she's  lost her man; and I happen to know that she just plain loved John!"    The second boot landed beside the first, then Linda picked them both up  and started toward the back hall.
    "Honey, are ye too bad hurt to help me any?" asked Katy, as she passed  her.
    "Of course not," said Linda.
 "Give me a few minutes to take a bath and  step into my clothes and then I'll be on the job.
"    With a black scowl on her face, Linda climbed the dingy back stairway  in her stocking-feet.
 At the head of the stairs she paused one minute,  glanced at the gloom of her end of the house, then she turned and walked  to the front of the hall where there were potted ferns, dainty white  curtains, and bright rugs.
 The door of the guest room stood open and she  could see that it was filled with fresh flowers and ready for occupancy.
  The door of her sister's room was slightly ajar and she pushed it open  and stood looking inside.
 In her state of disarray she made a shocking  contrast to the flowerlike figure busy before a dressing table.
 Linda  was dark, narrow, rawboned, overgrown in height, and forthright of  disposition.
 Eileen was a tiny woman, delicately moulded, exquisitely  colored, and one of the most perfectly successful tendrils from the  original clinging vine in her intercourse with men, and with such women  as would tolerate the clinging-vine idea in the present forthright days.
  With a strand of softly curled hair in one hand and a fancy pin in the  other, Eileen turned a disapproving look upon her sister.
    "What's the great idea?" demanded Linda shortly.
    "Oh, it's perfectly splendid," answered Eileen.
 "John Gilman's best  friend is motoring around here looking for a location to build a home.
  He is an author and young and good looking and not married, and he  thinks he would like to settle somewhere near Los Angeles.
 Of course  John would love to have him in Lilac Valley because he hopes to build a  home here some day for himself.
 His name is Peter Morrison and John says  that his articles and stories have horse sense, logic, and humor, and he  is making a lot of money.
"    "Then God help John Gilman, if he thinks now that he is in love with  you," said Linda dryly.
    Eileen arched her eyebrows, thinned to a hair line, and her lips drew  together in disapproval.
    "What I can't understand," she said, "is how you can be so unspeakably  vulgar, Linda.
"    Linda laughed sharply.
    "And this Peter Morrison and John are our guests for dinner?"    "Yes," said Eileen.
 "I am going to show them this valley inside and out.
  I'm so glad it's spring.
 We're at our very best.
 It would be perfectly  wonderful to have an author for a neighbor, and he must be going to  build a real house, because he has his architect with him; and John says  that while he is young, he has done several awfully good houses.
 He has  seen a couple of them in in San Francisco.
"    Linda shrugged her shoulders.
    "Up the flue goes Marian's chance of drawing the plans for John Gilman's  house," she said.
 "I have heard him say a dozen times he would not build  a house unless Marian made the plans.
"    Eileen deftly placed the strand of hair and set the jewelled pin with  precision.
    "Just possibly things have changed slightly," she suggested.
    "Yes," said Linda, "I observe that they have.
 Marian has sold the home  she adored.
 She is leaving friends she loved and trusted, and who were  particularly bound to her by a common grief without realizing exactly  how it is happening.
 She certainly must know that you have taken her  lover, and I have not a doubt but that is the reason she has discovered  she can no longer work at home, that she must sell her property and  spend the money cooped up in a city, to study her profession further.
"    "Linda," said Eileen, her face pale with anger, "you are positively  insufferable.
 Will you leave my room and close the door after you?"    "Well, Katy has just informed me," said Linda, "that this dinner party  doesn't come off without my valued assistance, and before I agree to  assist, I'll know ONE thing.
 Are you proposing to entertain these three  men yourself, or have you asked Marian?"    Eileen indicated an open note lying on her dressing table.
    "I did not know they were coming until an hour ago," she said.
 "_I_  barely had time to fill the vases and dust, and then I ran up to dress  so that there would be someone presentable when they arrive.
"    "All right then, we'll agree that this is a surprise party, but if John  Gilman has told you so much about them, you must have been expecting  them, and in a measure prepared for them at any time.
 Haven't you talked  it over with Marian, and told her that you would want her when they  came?"    Eileen was extremely busy with another wave of hair.
 She turned her back  and her voice was not quite steady as she answered.
 "Ever since Marian  got this 'going to the city to study' idea in her head I have scarcely  seen her.
 She had an awful job to empty the house, and pack such things  as she wants to keep, and she is working overtime on a very special plan  that she thinks maybe she'll submit in a prize competition offered by  a big firm of San Francisco architects, so I have scarcely seen her for  six weeks.
"    "And you never once went over to help her with her work, or to encourage  her or to comfort her? You can't think Marian can leave this valley and  not be almost heartbroken," said Linda.
 "You just make me almost wonder  at you.
 When you think of the kind of friends that Marian Thorne's  father and mother, and our father and mother were, and how we children  were reared together, and the good times we have had in these two  houses--and then the awful day when the car went over the cliff, and  how Marian clung to us and tried to comfort us, when her own health was  broken--and Marian's the same Marian she has always been, only nicer  every day--how you can sit there and say you have scarcely seen her in  six of the hardest weeks of her life, certainly surprises me.
 I'll tell  you this: I told Katy I would help her, but I won't do it if you don't  go over and make Marian come tonight.
"    Eileen turned to her sister and looked at her keenly.
 Linda's brow was  sullen, and her jaw set.
    "A bed would look mighty good to me and I will go and get into mine this  minute if you don't say you will go and ask her, in such a way that she  comes," she threatened.
    Eileen hesitated a second and then said: "All right, since you make such  a point of it I will ask her.
"    "Very well," said Linda.
 "Then I'll help Katy the very best I can.
"        .
 The House of Dreams    In less than an hour, Linda was in the kitchen, dressed in an old green  skirt and an orange blouse.
 Katy pinned one of her aprons on the girl  and told her that her first job was to set the table.
    "And Miss Eileen has given most particular orders that I use the very  best of everything.
 Lay the table for four, and you are to be extremely  careful in serving not to spill the soup.
"    Linda stood very quietly for a second, her heavy black brows drawn  together in deep thought.
    "When did Eileen issue these instructions?" she inquired.
    "Not five minutes ago," said Katy.
 "She just left me kitchen and I'll  say I never saw her lookin' such a perfect picture.
 That new dress of  hers is the most becoming one she has ever had.
"    Almost unconsciously, Linda's hand reached to the front of her well-worn  blouse, and she glanced downward at her skirt and shoes.
    "Um-hm," she said meditatively, "another new dress for Eileen, which  means that I will get nothing until next month's allowance comes in, if  I do then.
 The table set for four, which, interpreted, signifies that  she has asked Marian in such a way that Marian won't come.
 And the  caution as to care with the soup means that I am to serve my father's  table like a paid waitress.
 Katy, I have run for over three years on  Eileen's schedule, but this past year I am beginning to use my brains  and I am reaching the place of self-assertion.
 That programme won't do,  Katy.
 It's got to be completely revised.
 You just watch me and see how I  follow those instructions.
"    Then Linda marched out of the kitchen door and started across the lawn  in the direction of a big brown house dimly outlined through widely  spreading branches of ancient live oaks, palm, and bamboo thickets.
  She entered the house without knocking and in the hall uttered a low  penetrating whistle.
 It was instantly answered from upstairs.
 Linda  began climbing, and met Marian at the top.
    "Why, Marian," she cried, "I had no idea you were so far along.
 The  house is actually empty.
"    "Practically everything went yesterday," answered Marian.
 "Those things  of Father's and Mother's and my own that I wish to keep I have put in  storage, and the remainder went to James's Auction Rooms.
 The house is  sold, and I am leaving in the morning.
"    "Then that explains," questioned Linda, "why you refused Eileen's  invitation to dinner tonight?"    "On the contrary," answered Marian, "an invitation to dinner tonight  would be particularly and peculiarly acceptable to me, since the kitchen  is barren as the remainder of the house, and I was intending to slip  over when your room was lighted to ask if I might spend the night with  you.
"    Linda suddenly gathered her friend in her arms and held her tight.
    "Well, thank heaven that you felt sufficiently sure of me to come to me  when you needed me.
 Of course you shall spend the night with me; and I  must have been mistaken in thinking Eileen had been here.
 She probably  will come any minute.
 There are guests for the night.
 John is bringing  that writer friend of his.
 Of course you know about him.
 It's Peter  Morrison.
"    Marian nodded her head.
 "Of course! John has always talked of him.
 He  had some extremely clever articles in The Post lately.
"    "Well, he is one," said Linda, "and an architect who is touring with him  is two; they are looking for a location to build a house for the writer.
  You can see that it would be a particularly attractive feather in our  cap if he would endorse our valley sufficiently to home in it.
 So  Eileen has invited them to sample our brand of entertainment, and in the  morning no doubt she will be delighted to accompany them and show them  all the beautiful spots not yet preempted.
"    "Oh, heavens," cried Marian, "I'm glad I never showed her my spot!"    "Well, if you are particular about wanting a certain place I sincerely  hope you did not," said Linda.
    "I am sure I never did," answered Marian.
 "I so love one spot that I  have been most secretive about it.
 I am certain I never went further  than to say there was a place on which I would love to build for myself  the house of my dreams.
 I have just about finished getting that home  on paper, and I truly have high hopes that I may stand at least a fair  chance of winning with it the prize Nicholson and Snow are offering.
  That is one of the reasons why I am hurrying on my way to San Francisco  much sooner than I had expected to go.
 I haven't a suitable dinner dress  because my trunks have gone, but among such old friends it won't matter.
  I have one fussy blouse in my bag, and I'll be over as soon as I can see  to closing up the house and dressing.
"    Linda hurried home, and going to the dining room, she laid the table for  six in a deft and artistic manner.
 She filled a basket with beautiful  flowers of her own growing for a centerpiece, and carefully followed  Eileen's instruction to use the best of everything.
 When she had  finished she went to the kitchen.
    "Katy," she said, "take a look at my handiwork.
"    "It's just lovely," said Katy heartily.
    "I quite agree with you," answered Linda, "and now in pursuance of a  recently arrived at decision, I have resigned, vamoosed, quit, dead  stopped being waitress for Eileen.
 I was seventeen my last birthday.
  Hereafter when there are guests I sit at my father's table, and you will  have to do the best you can with serving, Katy.
"    "And it's just exactly right ye are," said Katy.
 "I'll do my best, and  if that's not good enough, Miss Eileen knows what she can do.
"    "Now listen to you," laughed Linda.
 "Katy, you couldn't be driven to  leave me, by anything on this earth that Eileen could do; you know you  couldn't.
"    Katy chuckled quietly.
 "Sure, I wouldn't be leaving ye, lambie," she  said.
 "We'll get everything ready, and I can serve I six as nicely as  anyone.
 But you're not forgetting that Miss Eileen said most explicit to  lay the table for FOUR?'    "I am not forgetting," said Linda.
 "For Eileen's sake I am I sorry  to say that her ship is on the shoals.
 She is not going to have clear  sailing with little sister Linda any longer.
 This is the year of woman's  rights, you know, Katy, and I am beginning to realize that my rights  have been badly infringed upon for lo these many years.
 If Eileen  chooses to make a scene before guests, that is strictly up to Eileen.
  Now what is it you want me to do?"    Katy directed and Linda worked swiftly.
 Soon they heard a motor stop,  and laughing voices told them that the guests had arrived.
    "Now I wonder," said Linda, "whether Marian is here yet.
"    At that minute Marian appeared at the kitchen door.
    "Linda," she said breathlessly, "I am feeling queer about this.
 Eileen  hasn't been over.
"    "Oh, that's all right," said Linda casually.
 "The folks have come, and  she was only waiting to make them a bit at home before she ran after  you.
"    Marian hesitated.
    "She was not allowing me much time to dress.
"    "That's 'cause she knew you did not need it," retorted Linda.
 "The more  you fuss up, the less handsome you are, and you never owned anything in  your life so becoming as that old red blouse.
 So farewell, Katy, we're  due to burst into high society tonight.
 We're going to help Eileen vamp  a lawyer, and an author, and an architect, one apiece.
 Which do you  prefer, Marian?"    "I'll take the architect," said Marian.
 "We should have something in  common since I am going to be a great architect myself one of these  days.
"    "Why, that is too bad," said Linda.
 "I'll have to rearrange the table if  you insist, because I took him, and left you the author, and it was for  love of you I did it.
 I truly wanted him myself, all the time.
"    They stopped in the dining room and Marian praised Linda's work in  laying the table; and then, together they entered the living room.
    At the moment of their entrance, Eileen was talking animatedly about the  beauties of the valley as a location for a happy home.
 When she saw the  two girls she paused, the color swiftly faded from her face, and Linda,  who was watching to see what would happen, noticed the effort she made  at self-control, but she was very sure that their guests did not.
    It never occurred to Linda that anyone would consider good looks in  connection with her overgrown, rawboned frame and lean face, but she was  accustomed to seeing people admire Marian, for Marian was a perfectly  modeled woman with peach bloom cheeks, deep, dark eyes, her face framed  in a waving mass of hair whose whiteness dated from the day that the  brakes of her car failed and she plunged down the mountain with her  father beside her, and her mother and Doctor and Mrs. Strong in the back  seat.
 Ten days afterward Marian's head of beautiful dark hair was muslin  white.
 Now it framed a face of youth and beauty with peculiar pathos.
  "Striking" was perhaps the one adjective which would best describe her.
    John Gilman came hastily to greet them.
 Linda, after a swift glance  at Eileen, turned astonished eyes on their guests.
 For one second  she looked at the elder of them, then at the younger.
 There was no  recognition in her eyes, and there was a decided negative in a swift  movement of her head.
 Both men understood that she did not wish them to  mention that they ever had seen her previously.
 For an instant there  was a strained situation.
 Eileen was white with anger.
 John Gilman was  looking straight at Marian, and in his soul he must have wondered if  he had been wise in neglecting her for Eileen.
 Peter Morrison and his  architect, Henry Anderson, had two things to think about.
 One was the  stunning beauty of Marian Thorne as she paused in the doorway, the light  misting her white hair and deepening the tints of her red waist The  other was why the young girl facing them had forbidden them to reveal  that two hours before they had seen her in the canyon.
 Katy, the  efficient life-saver of the Strong family, announced dinner, and Linda  drew back the curtains and led the way to the dining room, saying  when they had arrived: "I didn't have time in my hour's notice to make  elaborate place cards as I should have liked to do, so these little pen  sketches will have to serve.
"    To cover his embarrassment and to satisfy his legal mind, John Gilman  turned to Linda, asking: "Why 'an hour'? I told Eileen a week ago I was  expecting the boys today.
"    "But that does not prove that Eileen mentioned it to me," answered Linda  quietly; "so you must find your places from the cards I could prepare in  a hurry.
"    This same preparation of cards at the round table placed Eileen between  the architect and the author, Marian between the author and John Gilman,  and Linda between Gilman and the architect, which added one more tiny  gale to the storm of fury that was raging in the breast of white-faced  Eileen.
 The situation was so strained that without fully understanding  it, Marian, who was several years older than either of the Strong  sisters, knew that although she was tired to the point of exhaustion  she should muster what reserve force she could to the end of making the  dinner party particularly attractive, because she was deeply interested  in drawing to the valley every suitable home seeker it was possible  to locate there.
 It was the unwritten law of the valley that whenever  a home seeker passed through, every soul who belonged exerted the  strongest influence to prove that the stars hung lower and shone bigger  and in bluer heavens than anywhere else on earth; that nowhere could  be found air to equal the energizing salt breezes from the sea, snow  chilled, perfumed with almond and orange; that the sun shone brighter  more days in the year, and the soil produced a greater variety of  vegetables and fruits than any other spot of the same size on God's  wonderful footstool.
 This could be done with unanimity and enthusiasm  by every resident of Lilac Valley for the very simple reason that it was  the truth.
 The valley stood with its steep sides raying blue from myriad  wild lilacs; olives and oranges sloped down to the flat floor, where  cultivated ranches and gardens were so screened by eucalyptus and pepper  trees, palm and live oak, myriads of roses of every color and variety,  and gaudy plants gathered there from the entire girth of the  tropical world, that to the traveler on the highway trees and flowers  predominated.
 The greatest treasure of the valley was the enthusiastic  stream of icy mountain water that wandered through the near-by canyon  and followed the length of the valley on its singing, chuckling way  to the ocean.
 All the residents of Lilac Valley had to do to entrance  strangers with the location was to show any one of a dozen vantage  points, and let visitors test for themselves the quality of the sunshine  and air, and study the picture made by the broad stretch of intensively  cultivated valley, walled on either side by mountains whose highest  peaks were often cloud-draped and for ever shifting their delicate  pastel shades from gray to blue, from lavender to purple, from tawny  yellow to sepia, under the play of the sun and clouds.
    They had not been seated three minutes before Linda realized from her  knowledge of Eileen that the shock had been too great, if such a thing  might be said of so resourceful a creature as Eileen.
 Evidently she was  going to sulk in the hope that this would prove that any party was a  failure at which she did not exert herself to be gracious.
 It had not  been in Linda's heart to do more than sit quietly in the place belonging  by right to her, but when she realized what was going to happen, she  sent Marian one swift appealing glance, and then desperately plunged  into conversation to cover Eileen's defection.
    "I have been told," she said, addressing the author, "that you are  looking for a home in California.
 Is this true, or is it merely that  every good Californian hopes this will happen when any distinguished  Easterner comes our way?"    "I can scarcely answer you," said Peter Morrison, "because my ideas on  the subject are still slightly nebulous, but I am only too willing to  see them become concrete.
"    "You have struck exactly the right place," said Linda.
 "We have concrete  by the wagon load in this valley and we are perfectly willing to donate  the amount required to materialize your ideas.
 Do you dream of a whole  ranch or only a nest?"    "Well, the fact is," answered Peter Morrison with a most attractive  drawl in his slow speech, "the fact is the dimensions of my dream must  fit my purse.
 Ever since I finished college I have been in newspaper  work and I have lived in an apartment in New York except while I was  abroad.
 When I came back my paper sent me to San Francisco and from  there I motored down to see for myself if the wonderful things that are  written about Los Angeles County are true.
"    "That is not much of a compliment to us," said Linda slowly.
 "How do you  think we would dare write them if they were not true?"    This caused such a laugh that everyone felt much easier.
 Marian turned  her dark eyes toward Peter Morrison.
    "Linda and I are busy people," she said.
 "We waste little time  in indirections, so I hope it's not out of the way for me to ask  straightforwardly if you are truly in earnest, about wanting a home in  Lilac Valley?"    "Then I'll have to answer you," said Peter, "that I have an attractive  part of the 'makin's' and I am in deadly earnest about wanting a home  somewhere.
 I am sick in my soul of narrow apartments and wheels and the  rush and roar of the city.
 There was a time when I ate and drank it.
  It was the very breath of life to me.
 I charged on Broadway like a  caterpillar tank charging in battle; but it is very remarkable how  quickly one changes in this world.
 I have had some success in my work,  and the higher I go, the better work I feel I can do in a quiet place  and among less enervating surroundings.
 John and I were in college  together, roommates, and no doubt he has told you that we graduated with  the same class.
 He has found his location here and I would particularly  enjoy having a home near him.
 They tell me there are well-trained  servants to look after a house and care for a bachelor, so I truly feel  that if I can find a location I would like, and if Henry can plan me a  house, and I can stretch my purse to cover the investment, that there  is a very large possibility that somewhere within twenty miles of Los  Angeles I may find the home of my dreams.
"    "One would almost expect," said Marian, "that a writer would say  something more original.
 This valley is filled with people who came here  saying precisely what you have said; and the lure of the land won them  and here they are, shameless boosters of California.
"    "Why shameless?" inquired Henry Anderson.
    "Because California so verifies the wildest statement that can be made  concerning her that one may go the limit of imagination without shame,"  laughed Marian.
 "I try in all my dealings to stick to the straight and  narrow path.
"    "Oh, kid, don't stick to the straight and narrow," broke in Linda,  "there's no scenery.
"    Eileen laid down her fork and stared in white-lipped amazement at the  two girls, but she was utterly incapable of forgetting herself and her  neatly arranged plans to have the three cultivated and attractive  young men all to herself for the evening.
 She realized too, from the  satisfaction betrayed in the glances these men were exchanging among  each other, the ease with which they sat, and the gusto with which they  ate the food Katy was deftly serving them, that something was happening  which never had happened at the Strong table since she had presided  as its head, her sole endeavor having been to flatter her guests or to  extract flattery for herself from them.
    "That is what makes this valley so adorable," said Marian when at last  she could make herself heard.
 "It is neither straight nor narrow.
 The  wing of a white sea swallow never swept a lovelier curve on the breast  of the ocean than the line of this valley.
 My mother was the dearest  little woman, and she used to say that this valley was outlined by a  gracious gesture from the hand of God in the dawn of Creation.
"    Peter Morrison deliberately turned in his chair, his eyes intent on  Marian's earnest face.
    "You almost make me want to say, in the language of an old hymn I used  to hear my mother sing, 'Here will I set up my rest.
' With such a name  as Lilac Valley and with such a thought in the heart concerning it, I  scarcely feel that there is any use in looking further.
 How about it,  Henry? Doesn't it sound conclusive to you?"    "It certainly does," answered Henry Anderson, "and from what I could see  as we drove in, it looks as well as it sounds.
"    Peter Morrison turned to his friend.
    "Gilman," he said, "you're a lawyer; you should know the things I'd like  to.
 Are there desirable homesites still to be found in the valley,  and does the inflation of land at the present minute put it out of my  reach?"    "Well, that is on a par with the average question asked a lawyer,"  answered Gilman, "but part of it I can answer definitely and at once.
  I think every acre of land suitable for garden or field cultivation is  taken.
 I doubt if there is much of the orchard land higher up remaining  and what there is would command a rather stiff price; but if you would  be content with some small plateau at the base of a mountain where you  could set any sort of a house and have--say two or three acres, mostly  of sage and boulders and greasewood and yucca around it.
"    "Why in this world are you talking about stones and sage and  greasewood?" cried Linda.
 "Next thing they'll be asking about mountain  lions and rattlesnakes.
"    "I beg your pardon," said Gilman, "I fear none of us has remembered to  present Miss Linda as a coming naturalist.
 She got her start from her  father, who was one of the greatest nerve specialists the world ever  has known.
 She knows every inch of the mountains, the canyons and the  desert.
 She always says that she cut her teeth on a chunk of adobe,  while her father hunted the nests of trap-door spiders out in Sunland.
  What should I have said when describing a suitable homesite for Peter,  Linda?"    "You should have assumed that immediately, Peter,"--Linda lifted her  eyes to Morrison's face with a sparkle of gay challenge, and by way of  apology interjected--"I am only a kid, you know, so I may call John's  friend Peter--you should have assumed that sage and greasewood would  simply have vanished from any home location chosen by Peter, leaving it  all lacy blue with lilac, and misty white with lemonade bush, and lovely  gold with monkey flower, and purple with lupin, and painted blood red  with broad strokes of Indian paint brush, and beautifully lighted with  feathery flames from Our Lord's Candles, and perfumy as altar incense  with wild almond.
"    "Oh, my soul," said Peter Morrison.
 "Good people, I have located.
 I have  come to stay.
 I would like three acres but I could exist with two; an  acre would seem an estate to me, and my ideas of a house, Henry, are  shriveling.
 I did have a dream of something that must have been precious  near a home.
 There might have been an evanescent hint of flitting  draperies and inexperienced feet in it, but for the sake of living and  working in such a location as Miss Linda describes, I would gladly cut  my residence to a workroom and a sleeping room and kitchen.
"    "Won't do," said Linda.
 "A house is not a house in California without  a furnace and a bathroom.
 We are cold as blue blazes here when the sun  goes down and the salty fog creeps up from the sea, and the icy mist  rolls down from the mountains to chill our bones; and when it has not  rained for six months at a stretch, your own private swimming pool is  a comfort.
 This to add verisimilitude to what everyone else in Lilac  Valley is going to tell you.
"    "I hadn't thought I would need a fire," said Peter, "and I was depending  on the ocean for my bathtub.
 I am particularly fond of a salt rub.
"    So far, Eileen had not deigned to enter the conversation.
 It was all so  human, so far from her ideas of entertaining that the disapproval on her  lips was not sufficiently veiled to be invisible, and John Gilman,  glancing in her direction, realized that he was having the best time he  had ever had in the Strong household since the passing of his friends,  Doctor and Mrs. Strong, vaguely wondered why.
 And it occurred to him  that Linda and Marian were dominating the party.
 He said the most  irritating thing possible in the circumstances: "I am afraid you are not  feeling well this evening, Eileen.
"    Eileen laughed shortly.
    "The one perfect thing about me," she said with closely cut precision,  "is my health.
 I haven't the faintest notion what it means to be ill.
 I  am merely waiting for the conversation to take a I turn where I can join  in it intelligently.
"    "Why, bless the child!" exclaimed Linda.
 "Can't you talk intelligently  about a suitable location for a home? On what subject is a woman  supposed to be intelligent if she is not at her best on the theme of  home.
 If you really are not interested you had better begin to polish  up, because it appeals to me that the world goes just so far in one  direction, and then it whirls to the right-about and goes equally as far  in the opposite direction.
 If Daddy were living I think he would say we  have reached the limit with apartment house homes minus fireplaces, with  restaurant dining minus a blessing, with jazz music minus melody, with  jazz dancing minus grace, with national progress minus cradles.
"    "Linda!" cried Eileen indignantly.
    "Good gracious!" cried Linda.
 "Do I get the shillalah for that? Weren't  all of us rocked in cradles? I think that the pendulum has swung far  and it is time to swing back to where one man and one woman choose any  little spot on God's footstool, build a nest and plan their lives in  accord with personal desire and inclination instead of aping their  neighbors.
"    "Bravo!" cried Henry Anderson.
 "Miss Linda, if you see any suitable  spot, and you think I would serve for a bug-catcher, won't you please  stake the location?"    "Well, I don't know about that," said Linda.
 "Would it be the old case  of 'I furnish the bread and you furnish the water'?"    "No," said Peter Morrison, "it would not.
 Henry is doing mighty well.
 I  guarantee that he would furnish a cow that would produce real cream.
"    "How joyous!" said Linda.
 "I feel quite competent to manage the bread  question.
 We'll call that settled then.
 When I next cast an appraising  eye over my beloved valley, I shan't select the choicest spot in it for  Peter Morrison to write a book in; and I want to warn you people when  you go hunting to keep a mile away from Marian's plot.
 She has had her  location staked from childhood and has worked on her dream house until  she has it all ready to put the ice in the chest and scratch the match  for the living room fire-logs.
 The one thing she won't ever tell is  where her location is, but wherever it is, Peter Morrison, don't you  dare take it.
"    "I wouldn't for the world," said Peter Morrison gravely.
 "If Miss Thorne  will tell me even on which side of the valley her location lies, I will  agree to stay on the other side.
"    "Well there is one thing you can depend upon," said the irrepressible  Linda before Marian had time to speak.
 "It is sure to be on the sunny  side.
 Every living soul in California is looking for a place in the  sun.
"    "Then I will make a note of it," said Peter Morrison.
 "But isn't there  enough sun in all this lovely valley that I may have a place in it too?"    "You go straight ahead and select any location you like," said Marian.
  "I give you the freedom of the valley.
 There's not one chance in ten  thousand that you would find or see anything attractive about the one  secluded spot I have always hoped I might some day own.
"    "This is not fooling, then?" asked Peter Morrison.
 "You truly have a  place selected where you would like to live?"    "She truly has the spot selected and she truly has the house on paper  and it truly is a house of dreams," said Linda.
 "I dream about it  myself.
 When she builds it and lives in it awhile and finds out all the  things that are wrong with it, then I am going to build one like it,  only I shall eliminate all the mistakes she has made.
"    "I have often wondered," said Henry Anderson, "if such a thing ever  happened as that people built a house and lived in it, say ten years,  and did not find one single thing about it that they would change if  they had it to build over again.
 I never have heard of such a case.
 Have  any of you?"    "I am sure no one has," said John Gilman meditatively, "and it's a queer  thing.
 I can't see why people don't plan a house the way they want it  before they build.
"    Marian turned to him--the same Marian he had fallen in love with when  they were children.
    "Mightn't it be," she asked, "that it is due to changing conditions  caused by the rapid development of science and invention? If one had  built the most perfect house possible five years ago and learned today  that infinitely superior lighting and heating and living facilities  could be installed at much less expense and far greater convenience,  don't you think that one would want to change? Isn't life a series of  changes? Mustn't one be changing constantly to keep abreast of one's day  and age?"    "Why, surely," answered Gilman, "and no doubt therein lies at least part  of the answer to Anderson's question.
"    "And then," added Marian, "things happen in families.
 Sometimes more  babies than they expect come to newly married people and they require  more room.
"    "My goodness, yes!" broke in Linda.
 "Just look at Sylvia Townsend--twins  to begin with.
"    "Linda!" breathed Eileen, aghast.
    "So glad you like my name, dear," murmured Linda sweetly.
    "And then," continued Marian, "changes come to other people as they have  to me.
 I can't say that I had any fault to find with either the comforts  or the conveniences of Hawthorne House until Daddy and Mother were swept  from it at one cruel sweep; and after that it was nothing to me but  a haunted house, and I don't feel that I can be blamed for wanting to  leave it.
 I will be glad to know that there are people living in it who  won't see a big strong figure meditatively smoking before the fireplace  and a gray dove of a woman sitting on the arm of his chair.
 I will be  glad, if Fate is kind to me and people like my houses, to come back  to the valley when I can afford to and build myself a home that has no  past--a place, in fact, where I can furnish my own ghost, and if I meet  myself on the stairs then I won't be shocked by me.
    "I don't think there is a soul in the valley who blames you for selling  your home and going, Marian," said Linda soberly.
 "I think it would be  foolish if you did not.
"    The return to the living room brought no change.
 Eileen pouted while  Linda and Marian thoroughly enjoyed themselves and gave the guests a  most entertaining evening.
 So disgruntled was Eileen, when the young  men had gone, that she immediately went to her room, leaving Linda and  Marian to close the house and make their own arrangements for the night.
  Whereupon Linda deliberately led Marian to the carefully dusted and  flower-garnished guest room and installed her with every comfort and  convenience that the house afforded.
 Then bringing her brushes from her  own room, she and Marian made themselves comfortable, visiting far into  the night.
    "I wonder," said Linda, "if Peter Morrison will go to a real estate man  in the morning and look over the locations remaining in Lilac Valley.
"    "Yes, I think he will," said Marian conclusively.
    "It seems to me," said Linda, "that we did a whole lot of talking about  homes tonight; which reminds me, Marian, in packing have you put in your  plans? Have you got your last draft with you?"    "No," answered Marian, "it's in one of the cases.
 I haven't anything but  two or three pencil sketches from which I drew the final plans as I now  think I'll submit them for the contest.
 Wouldn't it be a tall feather in  my cap, Linda, if by any chance l I should win that prize?"    "It would be more than a feather," said Linda.
 "It would be a whole cap,  and a coat to wear with it, and a dress to match the coat, and slippers  to match the dress, and so forth just like 'The House That Jack Built.
'  Have you those sketches, Marian?"    Opening her case, Marian slid from underneath the garments folded in it,  several sheets on which were roughly penciled sketches of the exterior  of a house--on the reverse, the upstairs and downstairs floor plans; and  sitting down, she explained these to Linda.
 Then she left them lying  on a table, waiting to be returned to her case before she replaced her  clothes in the morning.
 Both girls were fast asleep when a mischievous  wind slipped down the valley, and lightly lifting the top sheet, carried  it through the window, across the garden, and dropped it at the foot of  a honey-dripping loquat.
    Because they had talked until late in the night of Marian's plans and  prospects in the city, of Peter Morrison's proposed residence in the  valley, of how lonely Linda would be without Marian, of everything  concerning their lives except the change in Eileen and John Gilman, the  two girls slept until late in the morning, so that there were but a few  minutes remaining in which Marian might dress, have a hasty breakfast  and make her train.
 In helping her, it fell to Linda to pack Marian's  case.
 She put the drawings she found on the table in the bottom, the  clothing and brushes on top of them, and closing the case, carried it  herself until she delivered it into the porter's hands as Marian boarded  her train.
        .
 Linda Starts a Revolution    The last glimpse Marian Thorne had of Linda was as she stood alone,  waving her hand, her cheeks flushed, her eyes shining, her final word  cheery and encouraging.
 Marian smiled and waved in return until the  train bore her away.
 Then she sat down wearily and stared unseeingly  from a window.
 Life did such very dreadful things to people.
 Her  girlhood had been so happy.
 Then came the day of the Black Shadow, but  in her blackest hour she had not felt alone.
 She had supposed she was  leaning on John Gilman as securely as she had leaned on her father.
 She  had learned, with the loss of her father, that one cannot be sure of  anything in this world least of all of human life.
 Yet in her darkest  days she had depended on John Gilman.
 She had every reason to believe  that it was for her that he struggled daily to gain a footing in his  chosen profession.
 When success came, when there was no reason that  Marian could see why they might not have begun life together, there had  come a subtle change in John, and that change had developed so  rapidly that in a few weeks' time, she was forced to admit that the  companionship and loving attentions that once had been all hers were now  all Eileen's.
    She sat in the train, steadily carrying her mile after mile farther from  her home, and tried to think what had happened and how and why it had  happened.
 She could not feel that she had been wrong in her estimate of  John Gilman.
 Her valuation of him had been taught her by her father and  mother and by Doctor and Mrs. Strong and by John Gilman himself.
 Dating  from the time that Doctor Strong had purchased the property and built a  home in Lilac Valley beside Hawthorne House, Marian had admired Eileen  and had loved her.
 She was several years older than the beautiful girl  she had grown up beside.
 Age had not mattered; Eileen's beauty had not  mattered.
 Marian was good looking herself.
    She always had known that Eileen had imposed upon her and was selfish  with her, but Eileen's impositions were so skillfully maneuvered,  her selfishness was so adorably taken for granted that Marian in  retrospection felt that perhaps she was responsible for at least a  small part of it.
 She never had been able to see the inner workings  of Eileen's heart.
 She was not capable of understanding that when  John Gilman was poor and struggling Eileen had ignored him.
 It had not  occurred to Marian that when the success for which he struggled began to  come generously, Eileen would begin to covet the man she had previously  disdained.
 She had always striven to find friends among people of wealth  and distinction.
 How was Marian to know that when John began to achieve  wealth and distinction, Eileen would covet him also?    Marian could not know that Eileen had studied her harder than she ever  studied any book, that she had deliberately set herself to make the most  of every defect or idiosyncrasy in Marian, at the same time offering  herself as a charming substitute.
 Marian was prepared to be the mental,  the spiritual, and the physical mate of a man.
    Eileen was not prepared to be in truth and honor any of these.
 She was  prepared to make any emergency of life subservient to her own selfish  desires.
 She was prepared to use any man with whom she came in contact  for the furtherance of any whim that at the hour possessed her.
 What she  wanted was unbridled personal liberty, unlimited financial resources.
    Marian, almost numbed with physical fatigue and weeks of mental strain,  came repeatedly against the dead wall of ignorance when she tried to  fathom the change that had taken place between herself and John Gilman  and between herself and Eileen.
 Daniel Thorne was an older man than  Doctor Strong.
 He had accumulated more property.
 Marian had sufficient  means at her command to make it unnecessary for her to acquire a  profession or work for her living, but she had always been interested in  and loved to plan houses and help her friends with buildings they  were erecting.
 When the silence and the loneliness of her empty home  enveloped her, she had begun, at first as a distraction, to work on the  drawings for a home that an architect had made for one of her neighbors.
  She had been able to suggest so many comforts and conveniences, and so  to revise these plans that, at first in a desultory way, later in  real earnest, she had begun to draw plans for houses.
 Then, being of  methodical habit and mathematical mind, she began scaling up the plans  and figuring on the cost of building, and so she had worked until she  felt that she was evolving homes that could be built for the same amount  of money and lived in with more comfort and convenience than the homes  that many of her friends were having planned for them by architects of  the city.
    To one spot in the valley she had gone from childhood as a secret place  in which to dream and study.
 She had loved that retreat until it had  become a living passion with her.
 The more John Gilman neglected her,  the more she concentrated upon her plans, and when the hour came in  which she realized what she had lost and what Eileen had won, she  reached the decision to sell her home, go to the city, and study until  she knew whether she really could succeed at her chosen profession.
    Then she would come back to the valley, buy the spot she coveted, build  the house of which she dreamed, and in it she would spend the remainder  of her life making homes for the women who knew how to hold the love  of men.
 When she reached the city she had decided that if one could not  have the best in life, one must be content with the next best, and for  her the next best would be homes for other people, since she might not  materialize the home she had dreamed for John Gilman and herself.
 She  had not wanted to leave the valley.
 She had not wanted to lose John  Gilman.
 She had not wanted to part with the home she had been reared in.
  Yet all of these things seemed to have been forced upon her.
 All Marian  knew to do was to square her shoulders, take a deep breath, put regrets  behind her, and move steadily toward the best future she could devise  for herself.
    She carried letters of introduction to the San Francisco architects,  Nicholson and Snow, who had offered a prize for the best house that  could be built in a reasonable time for fifteen thousand dollars.
 She  meant to offer her plans in this competition.
 Through friends she had  secured a comfortable place in which to live and work.
 She need undergo  no hardships in searching for a home, in clothing herself, in paying for  instruction in the course in architecture she meant to pursue.
    Concerning Linda she could not resist a feeling of exultation.
 Linda  was one of the friends in Lilac Valley about whom Marian could think  wholeheartedly and lovingly.
 Sometimes she had been on the point of  making a suggestion to Linda, and then she had contented herself with  waiting in the thought that very soon there must come to the girl a  proper sense of her position and her rights.
 The experience of the  previous night taught Marian that Linda had arrived.
 She would no longer  be the compliant little sister who would run Eileen's errands, wait upon  her guests and wear disreputable clothing.
 When Linda reached a point  where she was capable of the performance of the previous night, Marian  knew that she would proceed to live up to her blue china in every  ramification of life.
 She did not know exactly how Linda would follow up  the assertion of her rights that she had made, but she did know that  in some way she would follow it up, because Linda was a very close  reproduction of her father.
    She had been almost constantly with him during his life, very much alone  since his death.
 She was a busy young person.
 From Marian's windows  she had watched the business of carrying on the wild-flower garden that  Linda and her father had begun.
 What the occupation was that kept the  light burning in Linda's room far into the night Marian did not know.
  For a long time she had supposed that her studies were difficult for  her, and when she had asked Linda if it were not possible for her to  prepare her lessons without so many hours of midnight study she had  caught the stare of frank amazement with which the girl regarded her  and in that surprised, almost grieved look she had realized that very  probably a daughter of Alexander Strong, who resembled him as Linda  resembled him, would not be compelled to overwork to master the  prescribed course of any city high school.
 What Linda was doing during  those midnight hours Marian did not know, but she did know that she was  not wrestling with mathematics and languages--at least not all of the  time.
 So Marian knowing Linda's gift with a pencil, had come to the  conclusion that she was drawing pictures; but circumstantial evidence  was all she had as a basis for her conviction.
 Linda went her way  silently and alone.
 She was acquainted with everyone living in Lilac  Valley, frank and friendly with all of them; aside from Marian she  had no intimate friend.
 Not another girl in the valley cared to follow  Linda's pursuits or to cultivate the acquaintance of the breeched,  booted girl, constantly devoting herself to outdoor study with her  father during his lifetime, afterward alone.
    For an instant after Marian had boarded her train Linda stood looking at  it, her heart so heavy that it pained acutely.
 She had not said one word  to make Marian feel that she did not want her to go.
 Not once had she  put forward the argument that Marian's going would leave her to depend  entirely for human sympathy upon the cook, and her guardian, also  administrator of the Strong estate, John Gilman.
 So long as he was  Marian's friend Linda had admired John Gilman.
 She had gone to him for  some measure of the companionship she had missed in losing her father.
  Since Gilman had allowed himself to be captivated by Eileen, Linda  had harbored a feeling concerning him almost of contempt.
 Linda was so  familiar with every move that Eileen made, so thoroughly understood that  there was a motive back of her every action, that she could not see why  John Gilman, having known her from childhood, should not understand her  also.
    She had decided that the time had come when she would force Eileen to  give her an allowance, however small, for her own personal expenses,  that she must in some way manage to be clothed so that she was not a  matter of comment even among the boys of her school, and she could see  no reason why the absolute personal liberty she always had enjoyed so  long as she disappeared when Eileen did not want her and appeared when  she did, should not extend to her own convenience as well as Eileen's.
    Life was a busy affair for Linda.
 She had not time to watch Marian's  train from sight.
 She must hurry to the nearest street car and make all  possible haste or she would be late for her classes.
 Throughout the day  she worked with the deepest concentration, but she could not keep down  the knowledge that Eileen would have things to say, possibly things to  do, when they met that evening, for Eileen was capable of disconcerting  hysteria.
 Previously Linda had remained stubbornly silent during any  tirade in which Eileen chose to indulge.
 She had allowed herself to be  nagged into doing many things that she despised, because she would not  assert herself against apparent injustice.
 But since she had come fully  to realize the results of Eileen's course of action for Marian and for  herself, she was deliberately arriving at the conclusion that hereafter  she would speak when she had a defense, and she would make it her  business to let the sun shine on any dark spot that she discovered in  Eileen.
    Linda knew that if John Gilman were well acquainted with Eileen, he  could not come any nearer to loving her than she did.
 Such an idea as  loving Eileen never had entered Linda's thoughts.
 To Linda, Eileen was  not lovable.
 That she should be expected to love her because they had  the same parents and lived in the same home seemed absurd.
 She was  slightly disappointed, on reaching home, to find that Eileen was not  there.
    "Will the lady of the house dine with us this evening? she asked as she  stood eating an apple in the kitchen.
    "She didn't say," answered Katy.
 "Have ye had it out about last night  yet?"    "No," answered Linda.
 "That is why I was asking about her.
 I want to  clear the atmosphere before I make my new start in life.
"    "Now, don't ye be going too far, lambie," cautioned Katy "Ye young  things make such an awful serious business of life these days.
 In your  scramble to wring artificial joy out of it you miss all the natural joy  the good God provided ye.
"    "It seems to me, Katy," said Linda slowly, "that you should put that  statement the other way round.
 It seems that life makes a mighty serious  business for us young things, and it seems to me that if we don't get  the right start and have a proper foundation life Is going to be spoiled  for us.
 One life is all I've got to live in this world, and I would  like it to be the interesting and the beautiful kind of life that Father  lived.
"    Linda dropped to a chair.
    "Katy," she said, leaning forward and looking intently into the earnest  face of the woman before her, "Katy, I have been thinking an awful lot  lately.
 There is a question you could answer for me if you wanted to.
"    "Well, I don't see any raison," said Katy, "why I shouldn't answer ye  any question ye'd be asking me.
"    Linda's eyes narrowed as they did habitually in deep thought She was  looking past Katy down the sunlit spaces of the wild garden that was her  dearest possession, and then her eyes strayed higher to where the blue  walls that shut in Lilac Valley ranged their peaks against the sky.
  "Katy," she said, scarcely above her breath, "was Mother like Eileen?"    Katy stiffened.
 Her red face paled slightly.
 She turned her back and  slowly slid into the oven the pie she was carrying.
 She closed the door  with more force than was necessary and then turned and deliberately  studied Linda from the top of her shining black head to the tip of her  shoe.
    "Some," she said tersely.
    "Yes, I know 'some'," said Linda, "but you know I was too young to pay  much attention, and Daddy managed always to make me so happy that I  never realized until he was gone that he not only had been my father but  my mother as well.
 You know what I mean, Katy.
"    "Yes," said Katy deliberately, "I know what ye mean, lambie, and I'll  tell ye the truth as far as I know it.
 She managed your father, she  pampered him, but she deceived him every day, just about little things.
  She always made the household accounts bigger than they were, and used  the extra money for Miss Eileen and herself--things like that.
 I'm  thinkin' he never knew it.
 I'm thinking he loved her deeply and trusted  her complete.
 I know what ye're getting at.
 She was not enough like  Eileen to make him unhappy with her.
 He might have been if he had known  all there was to know, but for his own sake I was not the one to give  her away, though she constantly made him think that I was extravagant  and wasteful in me work.
" Linda's eyes came back from the mountains and  met Katy's straightly.
    "Katy," she said, "did you ever see sisters as different as Eileen and I  are?"    "No, I don't think I ever did," said Katy.
    "It puzzles me," said Linda slowly.
 "The more I think about it, the  less I can understand why, if we are sisters, we would not accidentally  resemble each other a tiny bit in some way, and I must say I can't see  that we do physically or mentally.
"    "No," said Katy, "ye were just as different as ye are now when I came to  this house new and ye were both little things.
"    "And we are going to be as different and to keep on growing more  different every day of our lives, because red war breaks out the minute  Eileen comes home.
 I haven't a notion what she will say to me for what  I did last night and what I am going to do in the future, but I have a  definite idea as to what I am going to say to her.
"    "Now, easy; ye go easy, lambie," cautioned Katy.
    "I wouldn't regret it," said Linda, "if I took Eileen by the shoulders  and shook her till I shook the rouge off her cheek, and the brilliantine  off her hair, and a million mean little subterfuges out of her soul.
  You know Eileen is lovely when she is natural, and if she would be  straight-off-the-bat square, I would be proud to be her sister.
 As it  is, I have my doubts, even about this sister business.
"    "Why, Linda, child, ye are just plain crazy," said Katy.
 "What kind of  notions are you getting into your head?"    "I hear the front door," said Linda, "and I am going to march straight  to battle.
 She's going up the front stairs.
 I did mean to short-cut up  the back, but, come to think of it, I have served my apprenticeship  on the back stairs.
 I believe I'll ascend the front myself.
 Good-bye,  darlin', wish me luck.
"    Linda swung Katy around, hugged her tight, and dropped a kiss on the top  of her faithful head.
    "Ye just stick right up for your rights," Katy advised her.
 "Ye're a  great big girl.
 'Tain't going to be long till ye're eighteen.
 But mind  your old Katy about going too far.
 If ye lose your temper and cat-spit,  it won't get ye anywhere.
 The fellow that keeps the coolest can always  do the best headwork.
"    "I get you," said Linda, "and that is good advice for which I thank  you.
"        .
 The Smoke of Battle    Then Linda walked down the hall, climbed the front stairs, and presented  herself at Eileen's door, there to receive one of the severest shocks of  her young life.
 Eileen had tossed her hat and fur upon a couch, seated  herself at her dressing table, and was studying her hair in the effort  to decide whether she could fluff it up sufficiently to serve for the  evening or whether she must take it down and redress it.
 At Linda's step  in the doorway she turned a smiling face upon her and cried: "Hello,  little sister, come in and tell me the news.
"    Linda stopped as if dazed.
 The wonderment in which she looked at Eileen  was stamped all over her.
 A surprised braid of hair hung over one of her  shoulders.
 Her hands were surprised, and the skirt of her dress, and her  shoes flatly set on the floor.
    "Well, I'll be darned!" she ejaculated, and then walked to where she  could face Eileen, and seated herself without making any attempt to  conceal her amazement.
    "Linda," said Eileen sweetly, "you would stand far better chance of  being popular and making a host of friends if you would not be  so coarse.
 I am quite sure you never heard Mama or me use such an  expression.
"    For one long instant Linda was too amazed to speak.
 Then she recovered  herself.
    "Look here, Eileen, you needn't try any 'perfect lady' business on me,"  she said shortly.
 "Do you think I have forgotten the extent of your  vocabulary when the curling iron gets too hot or you fail to receive an  invitation to the Bachelors' Ball?"    Linda never had been capable of understanding Eileen.
 At that minute she  could not know that Eileen had been facing facts through the long hours  of the night and all through the day, and that she had reached the  decision that for the future her only hope of working Linda to her will  was to conciliate her, to ignore the previous night, to try to put their  relationship upon the old basis by pretending that there never had been  a break.
 She laughed softly.
    "On rare occasions, I grant it.
 Of course a little swear slips out  sometimes.
 What I am trying to point out is that you do too much of it.
"    "How did you ever get the idea," said Linda, "that I wanted to be  popular and have hosts of friends? What would I do with them if I had  them?"    "Why, use them, my child, use them," answered Eileen promptly.
    "Let's cut this," said Linda tersely.
 "I am not your child.
 I'm getting  to the place where I have serious doubt as to whether I am your sister  or not.
 If I am, it's not my fault, and the same clay never made two  objects quite so different.
 I came up here to fight, and I'm going  to see it through.
 I'm on the warpath, so you may take your club and  proceed to battle.
"    "What have we to fight about?" inquired Eileen.
    "Every single thing that you have done that was unfair to me all my  life," said Linda.
 "Since all of it has been deliberate you probably  know more about the details than I do, so I'll just content myself  with telling you that for the future, last night marked a change in the  relations between us.
 I am going to be eighteen before so very long, and  I have ceased to be your maid or your waitress or your dupe.
 You are not  going to work me one single time when I have got brains to see through  your schemes after this.
 Hereafter I take my place in my father's house  and at my father's table on an equality with you.
"    Eileen looked at Linda steadily, trying to see to the depths of her  soul.
 She saw enough to convince her that the young creature in front of  her was in earnest.
    "Hm," she said, "have I been so busy that I have failed to notice what a  great girl you are getting?"    "Busy!" scoffed Linda.
 "Tell that to Katy.
 It's a kumquat!"    "Perhaps you are too big," continued Eileen, "to be asked to wait on the  table any more.
"    "I certainly am," retorted Linda, "and I am also too big to wear such  shoes or such a dress as I have on at the present min.
 ute.
 I know all  about the war and the inflation of prices and the reduction in income,  but I know also that if there is enough to run the house, and dress  you, and furnish you such a suite of rooms as you're enjoying right now,  there is enough to furnish me suitable clothes, a comfortable bedroom  and a place where I can leave my work without putting away everything I  am doing each time I step from the room.
 I told you four years ago that  you might take the touring car and do what you pleased with it.
 I have  never asked what you did or what you got out of it, so I'll thank you  to observe equal silence about anything I choose to do now with the  runabout, which I reserved for myself.
 I told you to take this suite,  and this is the first time that I have ever mentioned to you what you  spent on it.
"    Linda waved an inclusive hand toward the fully equipped, dainty  dressing table, over rugs of pale blue, and beautifully decorated walls,  including the sleeping room and bath adjoining.
    "So now I'll ask you to keep off while I do what I please about the  library and the billiard room.
 I'll try to get along without much money  in doing what I desire there, but I must have some new clothes.
 I want  money to buy me a pair of new shoes for school.
 I want a pair of pumps  suitable for evenings when there are guests to dinner.
 I want a couple  of attractive school dresses.
 This old serge is getting too hot and too  worn for common decency.
 And I also want a couple of dresses something  like you are wearing, for afternoons and evenings.
"    Eileen stared aghast at Linda.
    "Where," she inquired politely, "is the money for all this to come  from?"    "Eileen," said Linda in a low tense voice, "I have reached the place  where even the BOYS of the high school are twitting me about how I am  dressed, and that is the limit.
 I have stood it for three years from the  girls.
 I am an adept in pretending that I don't see, and I don't hear.
 I  have got to the point where I am perfectly capable of walking into your  wardrobe and taking out enough of the clothes there and selling them at  a second-hand store to buy me what I require to dress me just plainly  and decently.
 So take warning.
 I don't know where you are going to  get the money, but you are going to get it.
 If you would welcome a  suggestion from me, come home only half the times you dine yourself and  your girl friends at tearooms and cafes in the city, and you will save  my share that way.
 I am going to give you a chance to total your budget,  and then I demand one half of the income from Father's estate above  household expenses; and if I don't get it, on the day I am eighteen I  shall go to John Gilman and say to him what I have said to you, and I  shall go to the bank and demand that a division be made there, and that  a separate bank book be started for me.
"    Linda's amazement on entering the room had been worthy of note.
  Eileen's at the present minute was beyond description.
 Dumbfounded was a  colorless word to describe her state of mind.
    "You don't mean that," she gasped in a quivering voice when at last she  could speak.
    "I can see, Eileen, that you are taken unawares," said Linda.
 "I have  had four long years to work up to this hour.
 Hasn't it even dawned on  you that this worm was ever going to turn? You know exquisite moths and  butterflies evolve in the canyons from very unprepossessing and lowly  living worms.
 You are spending your life on the butterfly stunt.
 Have I  been such a weak worm that it hasn't ever occurred to you that I might  want to try a plain, everyday pair of wings sometime myself?"    Eileen's face was an ugly red, her hands were shaking, her voice was  unnatural, but she controlled her temper.
    "Of course," she said, "I have always known that the time would come,  after you finished school and were of a proper age, when you would want  to enter society.
"    "No, you never knew anything of the kind," said Linda bluntly, "because  I have not the slightest ambition to enter society either now or then.
  All I am asking is to enter the high school in a commonly decent,  suitable dress; to enter our dining room as a daughter; to enter a  workroom decently equipped for my convenience.
 You needn't be surprised  if you hear some changes going on in the billiard room and see some  changes going on in the library.
 And if I feel that I can muster the  nerve to drive the runabout, it's my car, it's up to me.
"    "Linda!" wailed Eileen, "how can you think of such a thing? You wouldn't  dare.
"    "Because I haven't dared till the present is no reason why I should  deprive myself of every single pleasure in life," said Linda.
 "You  spend your days doing exactly what you please; driving that runabout  for Father was my one soul-satisfying diversion.
 Why shouldn't I do the  thing I love most, if I can muster the nerve?"    Linda arose, and walking over to a table, picked up a magazine lying  among some small packages that Eileen evidently had placed there on  entering her room.
    "Are you subscribing to this?" she asked.
    She turned in her hands and leafed through the pages of a most  attractive magazine, Everybody's Home.
 It was devoted to poetry, good  fiction, and everything concerning home life from beef to biscuits, and  from rugs to roses.
    "I saw it on a newsstand," said Eileen.
 "I was at lunch with some girls  who had a copy and they were talking about some articles by somebody  named something--Meredith, I think it was--Jane Meredith, maybe she's  a Californian, and she is advocating the queer idea that we go back to  nature by trying modern cooking on the food the aborigines ate.
 If we  find it good then she recommends that we specialize on the growing of  these native vegetables for home use and for export--as a new industry.
"    "I see," said Linda.
 "Out-Burbanking Burbank, as it were.
"    "No, not that," said Eileen.
 "She is not proposing to evolve new forms.
  She is proposing to show us how to make delicious dishes for luncheon or  dinner from wild things now going to waste.
 What the girls said was so  interesting that I thought I'd get a copy and if I see anything good  I'll turn it over to Katy.
"    "And where's Katy going to get the wild vegetables?" asked Linda  sceptically.
    "Why you might have some of them in your wild garden, or you could  easily find enough to try--all the prowling the canyons you do ought to  result in something.
"    "So it should," said Linda.
 "I quite agree with you.
 Did I understand  you to say that I should be ready to go to the bank with you to arrange  about my income next week?"    Again the color deepened in Eileen's face, again she made a visible  effort at self-control.
    "Oh, Linda," she said, "what is the use of being so hard? You will make  them think at the bank that I have not treated you fairly.
"    "_I_?" said Linda, "_I_ will make them think? Don't you think it is YOU  who will make them think? Will you kindly answer my question?"    "If I show you the books," said Eileen, "if I divide what is left after  the bills are paid so that you say yourself that it is fair, what more  can you ask?"    Linda hesitated.
    "What I ought to do is exactly what I have said I would do," she said  tersely, "but if you are going to put it on that basis I have no desire  to hurt you or humiliate you in public.
 If you do that, I can't see that  I have any reason to complain, so we'll call it a bargain and we'll say  no more about it until the first of the month, unless the spirit moves  you, after taking a good square look at me, to produce some shoes and a  school dress instanter.
"    "I'll see what I can do," answered Eileen.
    "All right then," said Linda.
 "See you at dinner.
"    She went to her own room, slipped off her school dress, brushed her  hair, and put on the skirt and blouse she had worn the previous evening,  these being the only extra clothing she possessed.
 As she straightened  her hair she looked at herself intently.
    "My, aren't you coming on!" she said to the figure in the glass.
  "Dressing for dinner! First thing you know you'll be a perfect lady.
"        .
 Jane Meredith    When Eileen came down to dinner that evening Linda understood at a  glance that an effort was to be made to efface thoroughly from the mind  of John Gilman all memory of the Eileen of the previous evening.
 She had  decided on redressing her hair, while she wore one of her most becoming  and attractive gowns.
 To Linda and Katy during the dinner she was simply  charming.
 Having said what she wanted to say and received the assurance  she desired, Linda accepted her advances cordially and displayed such  charming proclivities herself that Eileen began covertly to watch her,  and as she watched there slowly grew in her brain the conviction that  something had happened to Linda.
 At once she began studying deeply in an  effort to learn what it might be.
 There were three paramount things  in Eileen's cosmos that could happen to a girl: She could have lovely  clothing.
 Linda did not have it.
 She could have money and influential  friends.
 Since Marian's going Linda had practically no friend; she was  merely acquainted with almost everyone living in Lilac Valley.
 She could  have a lover.
 Linda had none.
 But stay! Eileen's thought halted at the  suggestion.
 Maybe she had! She had been left completely, to her own  devices when she was not wanted about the house.
 She had been mingling  with hundreds of boys and girls in high school.
 She might have met some  man repeatedly on the street cars, going to and from school.
 In school  she might have attracted the son of some wealthy and influential family;  which was the only kind of son Eileen chose to consider in connection  with Linda.
 Through Eileen's brain ran bits of the conversation of the  previous evening.
 She recalled that the men she had intended should  spend the evening waiting on her and paying her pretty compliments had  spent it eating like hungry men, laughing and jesting with Linda and  Marian, giving every evidence of a satisfaction with their entertainment  that never had been evinced with the best brand of attractions she had  to offer.
    Eileen was willing to concede that Marian Thorne had been a beautiful  girl, and she had known, previous to the disaster, that it was quite as  likely that any man might admire Marian's flashing dark beauty as  her blonde loveliness.
 Between them then it would have been merely a  question of taste on the part of the man.
 Since Marian's dark head had  turned ashen, Eileen had simply eliminated her at one sweep.
 That white  hair would brand Marian anywhere as an old woman.
 Very likely no man  ever would want to marry her.
 Eileen was sure she would not want to if  she were a man.
 No wonder John Gilman had ceased to be attracted by a  girl's face with a grandmother setting.
    As for Linda, Eileen never had considered her at all except as a  convenience to serve her own purposes.
 Last night she had learned that  Linda had a brain, that she had wit, that she could say things to which  men of the world listened with interest.
 She began to watch Linda.
  She appraised with deepest envy the dark hair curling naturally on her  temples.
 She wondered how hair that curled naturally could be so thick  and heavy, and she thought what a crown of glory would adorn Linda's  head when the day came to coil those long dark braids around it and  fasten them with flashing pins.
 She drew some satisfaction from the  sunburned face and lean figure before her, but it was not satisfaction  of soul-sustaining quality.
 There was beginning to be something  disquieting about Linda.
 A roundness was creeping over her lean frame; a  glow was beginning to color her lips and cheek bones; a dewy look could  be surprised in her dark eyes occasionally.
 She had the effect of a  creature with something yeasty bottled inside it that was beginning to  ferment and might effervesce at any minute.
 Eileen had been so surprised  the previous evening and again before dinner, that she made up her mind  that hereafter one might expect almost anything from Linda.
 She would no  longer follow a suggestion unless the suggestion accorded with her sense  of right and justice.
 It was barely possible that it might be required  to please her inclinations.
 Eileen's mind worked with unbelievable  swiftness.
 She tore at her subject like a vulture tearing at a feast,  and like a vulture she reached the vitals swiftly.
 She prefaced her  question with a dry laugh.
 Then she leaned forward and asked softly:  "Linda, dear, why haven't you told me?"    Linda's eyes were so clear and honest as they met Eileen's that she  almost hesitated.
    "A little more explicit, please," said the girl quietly.
    "WHO IS HE?" asked Eileen abruptly.
    "Oh, I haven't narrowed to an individual," said Linda largely "You have  noticed a flock of boys following me from school and hanging around the  front door? I have such hosts to choose from that it's going to take a  particularly splendid knight on a snow-white charger--I think 'charger'  is the proper word--to capture my young affections.
"    Eileen was satisfied.
 There wasn't any he.
 She might for a short time  yet cut Linda's finances to the extreme limit.
 Whenever a man appeared  on the horizon she would be forced to make a division at least  approaching equality.
    Linda followed Eileen to the living room and sat down with a book until  John Gilman arrived.
 She had a desire to study him for a few minutes.
  She was going to write Marian a letter that night.
 She wanted to know  if she could honestly tell her that Gilman appeared lonely and seemed to  miss her.
 Katy had no chance to answer the bell when it rang.
 Eileen was  in the hall.
 Linda could not tell what was happening from the murmur of  voices.
 Presently John and Eileen entered the room, and as Linda greeted  him she did have the impression that he appeared unusually thoughtful  and worried.
 She sat for half an hour, taking slight part in the  conversation.
 Then she excused herself and went to her room, and as  she went she knew that she could not honestly write Marian what she had  hoped, for in thirty minutes by the clock Eileen's blandishments had  worked, and John Gilman was looking at her as if she were the most  exquisite and desirable creature in existence.
    Slowly Linda climbed the stairs and entered her room.
 She slid the bolt  of her door behind her, turned on the lights, unlocked a drawer, and  taking from it a heap of materials she scattered them over a small  table, and picking up her pencil, she sat gazing at the sheet before her  for some time.
 Then slowly she began writing:    It appeals to me that, far as modern civilization has gone in culinary  efforts, we have not nearly reached the limits available to us as I  pointed out last month.
 We consider ourselves capable of preparing and  producing elaborate banquets, yet at no time are we approaching anything  even to compare in lavishness and delicacy with the days of Lucullus.
  We are not feasting on baked swans, peacock tongues and drinking our  pearls.
 I am not recommending that we should revive the indulgence of  such lavish and useless expenditure, but I would suggest that if we tire  with the sameness of our culinary efforts, we at least try some of  the new dishes described in this department, established for the sole  purpose of their introduction.
 In so doing we accomplish a multiple  purpose.
 We enlarge the resources of the southwest.
 We tease stale  appetites with a new tang.
 We offer the world something different, yet  native to us.
 We use modern methods on Indian material and the results  are most surprising.
 In trying these dishes I would remind you that few  of us cared for oysters, olives, celery--almost any fruit or vegetable  one could mention on first trial.
 Try several times and be sure you  prepare dishes exactly right before condemning them as either fad or  fancy.
 These are very real, nourishing and delicious foods that are  being offered you.
 Here is a salad that would have intrigued the palate  of Lucullus, himself.
 If you do not believe me, try it.
 The vegetable  is slightly known by a few native mountaineers and ranchers.
 Botanists  carried it abroad where under the name of winter-purslane it is used  in France and England for greens or salad, while remaining practically  unknown at home.
 Boiled and seasoned as spinach it makes equally good  greens.
 But it is in salad that it stands pre-eminent.
    Go to any canyon--I shall not reveal the name of my particular  canyon--and locate a bed of miner's lettuce (Montia perfoliata).
 Growing  in rank beds beside a cold, clean stream, you will find these pulpy,  exquisitely shaped, pungent round leaves from the center of which lifts  a tiny head of misty white lace, sending up a palate-teasing, spicy  perfume.
 The crisp, pinkish stems snap in the fingers.
 Be sure that you  wash the leaves carefully so that no lurking germs cling to them.
 Fill  your salad bowl with the crisp leaves, from which the flowerhead has  been plucked.
 For dressing, dice a teacup of the most delicious bacon  you can obtain and fry it to a crisp brown together with a small sliced  onion.
 Add to the fat two tablespoons of sugar, half a teaspoon of  mustard; salt will scarcely be necessary the bacon will furnish that.
  Blend the fat, sugar, and mustard, and pour in a measure of the best  apple vinegar, diluted to taste.
 Bring this mixture to the boiling  point, and when it has cooled slightly pour it over the lettuce leaves,  lightly turning with a silver fork.
 Garnish the edge of the dish with  a deep border of the fresh leaves bearing their lace of white bloom  intact, around the edge of the bowl, and sprinkle on top the sifted  yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, heaping the diced whites in the center.
    Linda paused and read this over carefully.
    "That is all right," she said.
 "I couldn't make that much better.
"    She made a few corrections here and there, and picking up a colored  pencil, she deftly sketched in a head piece of delicate sprays of  miners' lettuce tipped at differing angles, fringy white with bloom.
  Below she printed: "A delicious Indian salad.
 The second of a series  of new dishes to be offered made from materials used by the Indians.
  Compounded and tested in her own diet kitchen by the author.
"    Swiftly she sketched a tail piece representing a table top upon which  sat a tempting-looking big salad bowl filled with fresh green leaves,  rimmed with a row of delicate white flowers, from which you could almost  scent a teasing delicate fragrance arising; and beneath, in a clear,  firm hand, she stroked in the name, Jane Meredith.
 She went over her  work carefully, then laid it flat on a piece of cardboard, shoved it  into an envelope, directed it to the editor of Everybody's Home, laid it  inside her geometry, and wrote her letter to Marian before going to bed.
    In the morning on her way to the street car she gaily waved to a passing  automobile going down Lilac Valley, in which sat John Gilman and Peter  Morrison and his architect, and as they were driving in the direction  from which she had come, Linda very rightly surmised that they were  going to pick up Eileen and make a tour of the valley, looking for  available building locations; and she wondered why Eileen had not told  her that they were coming.
 Linda had been right about the destination  of the car.
 It turned in at the Strong driveway and stopped at the door.
  John Gilman went to ring the bell and learn if Eileen were ready.
 Peter  followed him.
 Henry Anderson stepped from the car and wandered over the  lawn, looking at the astonishing array of bushes, vines, flowers, and  trees.
    From one to another he went, fingering the waxy leaves, studying the  brilliant flower faces.
 Finally turning a corner and crossing the wild  garden, to which he paid slight attention, he started down the other  side of the house.
 Here an almost overpowering odor greeted his  nostrils, and he went over to a large tree covered with rough, dark  green, almost brownish, lance-shaped leaves, each branch terminating  in a heavy spray of yellowish-green flowers, whose odor was of cloying  sweetness.
 The bees were buzzing over it.
 It was not a tree with which  he was familiar, and stepping back, he looked at it carefully.
 Then at  its base, wind-driven into a crevice between the roots, his attention  was attracted to a crumpled sheet of paper, upon which he could see  lines that would have attracted the attention of any architect.
 He went  forward instantly, picked up the sheet, and straightening it out he  stood looking at it.
    "Holy smoke!" he breathed softly.
 "What a find!"    He looked at the reverse of the sheet, his face becoming more intent  every minute.
 When he heard Peter Morrison's voice calling him he  hastily thrust the paper into his coat pocket; but he had gone only  a few steps when he stopped, glanced keenly over the house and lawn,  turned his back, and taking the sheet from his pocket, he smoothed it  out, folded it carefully, and put it in an inside pocket.
 Then he joined  the party.
    At once they set out to examine the available locations that yet  remained in Lilac Valley.
 Nature provided them a wonderful day of snappy  sunshine and heady sea air.
 Spring favored them with lilac walls at  their bluest, broken here and there with the rose-misted white mahogany.
  The violet nightshade was beginning to add deeper color to the hills  in the sunniest wild spots.
 The panicles of mahonia bloom were showing  their gold color.
 Wild flowers were lifting leaves of feather and lace  everywhere, and most agreeable on the cool morning air was a faint  breath of California sage.
 Up one side of the valley, weaving in and  out, up and down, over the foothills they worked their way.
 They stopped  for dinner at one of the beautiful big hotels, practically filled with  Eastern tourists.
 Eileen never had known a prouder moment than when she  took her place at the head of the table and presided over the dinner  which was served to three most attractive specimens of physical manhood,  each of whom was unusually well endowed with brain, all flattering her  with the most devoted attention.
 This triumph she achieved in a dining  room seating hundreds of people, its mirror-lined walls reflecting  her exquisite image from many angles, to the click of silver, and  the running accompaniment of many voices.
 What she had expected to  accomplish in her own dining room had come to her before a large  audience, in which, she had no doubt, there were many envious women.
  Eileen rayed loveliness like a Mariposa lily, and purred in utter  contentment like a deftly stroked kitten.
    When they parted in the evening Peter Morrison had memoranda of three  locations that he wished to consider.
 That he might not seem to be  unduly influenced or to be giving the remainder of Los Angeles County  its just due, he proposed to motor around for a week before reaching  an ultimate decision, but in his heart he already had decided that  somewhere near Los Angeles he would build his home, and as yet he had  seen nothing nearly so attractive as Lilac Valley.
        .
 Trying Yucca    On her way to school that morning Linda stopped at the post office  and pasted the required amount of stamps upon the package that she was  mailing to New York.
 She hurried from her last class that afternoon  to the city directory to find the street and number of James Brothers,  figuring that the firm with whom Marian dealt would be the proper people  for her to consult.
 She had no difficulty in finding the place for which  she was searching, and she was rather agreeably impressed with the men  to whom she talked.
 She made arrangements with their buyer to call at  her home in Lilac Valley at nine o'clock the following Saturday morning  to appraise the articles with which she wished to part.
    Then she went to one of the leading book stores of the city and made  inquiries which guided her to a reliable second-hand book dealer, and  she arranged to be ready to receive his representative at ten o'clock on  Saturday.
    Reaching home she took a note book and pencil, and studied the billiard  room and the library, making a list of the furniture which she did not  actually need.
 After that she began on the library shelves, listing such  medical works as were of a technical nature.
 Books of fiction, history,  art, and biography, and those books written by her father she did not  include.
 She found that she had a long task which would occupy several  evenings.
 Her mind was methodical and she had been with her father  through sufficient business transactions to understand that in order to  drive a good bargain she must know how many volumes she had to offer and  the importance of their authors as medical authorities; she should also  know the exact condition of each set of books.
 Since she had made up  her mind to let them go, and she knew the value of many of the big,  leather-bound volumes, she determined that she would not sell them until  she could secure the highest possible price for them.
    Two months previously she would have consulted John Gilman and asked him  to arrange the transaction for her.
 Since he had allowed himself to be  duped so easily--or at least it had seemed easy to Linda; for, much  as she knew of Eileen, she could not possibly know the weeks of secret  plotting, the plans for unexpected meetings, the trumped-up business  problems necessary to discuss, the deliberate flaunting of her physical  charms before him, all of which had made his conquest extremely hard  for Eileen, but Linda, seeing only results, had thought it contemptibly  easy--she would not ask John Gilman anything.
 She would go ahead on the  basis of her agreement with Eileen and do the best she could alone.
    She counted on Saturday to dispose of the furniture.
 The books might  go at her leisure.
 Then the first of the week she could select such  furniture as she desired in order to arrange the billiard room for her  study.
 If she had a suitable place in which to work in seclusion, there  need be no hurry about the library.
 She conscientiously prepared all  the lessons required in her school course for the next day and then,  stacking her books, she again unlocked the drawer opened the previous  evening, and taking from it the same materials, set to work.
 She wrote:    Botanists have failed to mention that there is any connection between  asparagus, originally a product of salt marshes, and Yucca, a product of  the alkaline desert.
 Very probably there is no botanical relationship,  but these two plants are alike in flavor.
 From the alkaline, sunbeaten  desert where the bayonet plant thrusts up a tender bloom head six inches  in height, it slowly increases in stature as it travels across country  more frequently rain washed, and winds its way beside mountain streams  to where in more fertile soil and the same sunshine it develops  magnificent specimens from ten to fifteen and more feet in height.
  The plant grows a number of years before it decides to flower.
 When it  reaches maturity it throws up a bloom stem as tender as the delicate  head of asparagus, thick as one's upper arm, and running to twice one's  height.
 This bloom stem in its early stages is colored the pale pink of  asparagus, with faint touches of yellow, and hints of blue.
 At maturity  it breaks into a gorgeous head of lavender-tinted, creamy pendent  flowers covering the upper third of its height, billowing out slightly  in the center, so that from a distance the waxen torch takes on very  much the appearance of a flaming candle.
 For this reason, in Mexico,  where the plant flourishes in even greater abundance than in California,  with the exquisite poetry common to the tongue and heart of the  Spaniard, Yucca Whipplei has been commonly named "Our Lord's Candle.
" At  the most delicate time of their growth these candlesticks were roasted  and eaten by the Indians.
 Based upon this knowledge, I would recommend  two dishes, almost equally delicious, which may be prepared from this  plant.
    Take the most succulent young bloom stems when they have exactly the  appearance of an asparagus head at its moment of delicious perfection.
  With a sharp knife, cut them in circles an inch in depth.
 Arrange these  in a shallow porcelain baking dish, sprinkle with salt, dot them with  butter, add enough water to keep them from sticking and burning.
 Bake  until thoroughly tender.
 Use a pancake turner to slide the rings to a  hot platter, and garnish with circles of hard-boiled egg.
 This you will  find an extremely delicate and appetizing dish.
    The second recipe I would offer is to treat this vegetable precisely as  you would creamed asparagus.
 Cut the stalks in six-inch lengths, quarter  them to facilitate cooking and handling, and boil in salted water.
  Drain, arrange in a hot dish, and pour over a carefully made cream  sauce.
 I might add that one stalk would furnish sufficient material for  several families.
 This dish should be popular in southwestern states  where the plant grows profusely; and to cultivate these plants for  shipping to Eastern markets would be quite as feasible as the shipping  of asparagus, rhubarb, artichokes, or lettuce.
    I have found both these dishes peculiarly appetizing, but I should be  sorry if, in introducing Yucca as a food, I became instrumental in the  extermination of this universal and wonderfully beautiful plant.
 For  this reason I have hesitated about including Yucca among these articles;  but when I see the bloom destroyed ruthlessly by thousands who cut it to  decorate touring automobiles and fruit and vegetable stands beside the  highways, who carry it from its native location and stick it in the  parching sun of the seashore as a temporary shelter, I feel that the  bloom stems might as well be used for food as to be so ruthlessly  wasted.
    The plant is hardy in the extreme, growing in the most unfavorable  places, clinging tenaciously to sheer mountain and canyon walls.
 After  blooming and seeding the plant seems to have thrown every particle of  nourishment it contains into its development, it dries out and dies (the  spongy wood is made into pincushions for the art stores); but from the  roots there spring a number of young plants, which, after a few years  of growth, mature and repeat their life cycle, while other young plants  develop from the widely scattered seeds.
 The Spaniards at times call the  plant Quiota.
 This word seems to be derived from quiotl, which is  the Aztec name for Agave, from which plant a drink not unlike beer is  produced, and suggests the possibility that there might have been a time  when the succulent flower stem of the Yucca furnished drink as well as  food for the Indians.
    After carefully re-reading and making several minor corrections, Linda  picked up her pencil, and across the top of a sheet of heavy paper  sketched the peaks of a chain of mountains.
 Across the base she drew  a stretch of desert floor, bristling with the thorns of many different  cacti brilliant with their gold, pink, and red bloom, intermingled with  fine grasses and desert flower faces.
    At the left she painstakingly drew a huge plant of yucca with a perfect  circle of bayonets, from the center of which uprose the gigantic flower  stem the length of her page, and on the misty bloom of the flaming  tongue she worked quite as late as Marian Thorne had ever seen a light  burning in her window.
 When she had finished her drawing she studied it  carefully a long time, adding a touch here and there, and then she said  softly: "There, Daddy, I feel that even you would think that a faithful  reproduction Tomorrow night I'll paint it.
"    John Gilman saw the light from Linda's window when he brought Eileen  home that night, and when he left he glanced that way again, and was  surprised to see the room still lighted, and the young figure bending  over a worktable.
 He stood very still for a few minutes, wondering what  could keep Linda awake so far into the night, and while his thoughts  were upon her he wondered, too, why she did not care to have beautiful  clothes such as Eileen wore; and then he went further and wondered why,  when she could be as entertaining as she had been the night she joined  them at dinner, she did not make her appearance oftener; and then,  because the mind is a queer thing, and he had wondered about a given  state of affairs, he went a step further, and wondered whether the  explanation lay in Linda's inclinations or in Eileen's management,  and then his thought fastened tenaciously upon the subject of Eileen's  management.
    He was a patient man.
 He had allowed his reason and better judgment to  be swayed by Eileen's exquisite beauty and her blandishments.
 He did not  regret having discovered before it was too late that Marian Thorne  was not the girl he had thought her.
 He wanted a wife cut after the  clinging-vine pattern.
 He wanted to be the dominating figure in  his home.
 It had not taken Eileen long to teach him that Marian was  self-assertive and would do a large share of dominating herself.
 He had  thought that he was perfectly satisfied and very happy with Eileen; yet  that day he repeatedly had felt piqued and annoyed with her.
 She had  openly cajoled and flirted with Henry Anderson past a point which was  agreeable for any man to see his sweetheart go with another man With  Peter Morrison she had been unspeakably charming in a manner with which  John was very familiar.
    He turned up his coat collar, thrust his hands in his pockets, and swore  softly.
 Looking straight ahead of him, he should have seen a stretch of  level sidewalk, bordered on one hand by lacy, tropical foliage, on the  other, by sheets of level green lawn, broken everywhere by the uprising  boles of great trees, clumps of rare vines, and rows of darkened homes,  attractive in architectural 'design' vine covered, hushed for the night.
  What he really saw was a small plateau, sun illumined, at the foot of a  mountain across the valley, where the lilac wall was the bluest, where  the sun shone slightly more golden than anywhere else in the valley,  where huge live oaks outstretched rugged arms, where the air had a tang  of salt, a tinge of sage, an odor of orange, shot through with snowy  coolness, thrilled with bird song, and the laughing chuckle of a big  spring breaking from the foot of the mountain.
 They had left the road  and followed a narrow, screened path by which they came unexpectedly  into this opening.
 They had stood upon it in wordless enchantment,  looking down the slope beneath it, across the peace of the valley, to  the blue ranges beyond.
    "Just where are we?" Peter Morrison had asked at last.
    John Gilman had been looking at a view which included Eileen.
 She lifted  her face, flushed and exquisite, to Peter Morrison and answered in a  breathless undertone, yet John had distinctly heard her:    "How wonderful it would be if we were at your house.
 Oh, I envy the  woman who shares this with you!"    It had not been anything in particular, yet all day it had teased John  Gilman's sensibilities.
 He felt ashamed of himself for not being more  enthusiastic as he searched records and helped to locate the owner of  that particular spot.
 To John, there was a new tone in Peter's voice,  a possessive light in his eyes as he studied the location, and made  excursions in several directions, to fix in his mind the exact position  of the land.
    He had indicated what he considered the topographical location for a  house--stood on it facing the valley, and stepped the distance suitably  far away to set a garage and figured on a short private road down to the  highway.
 He very plainly was deeply prepossessed with a location John  Gilman blamed himself for not having found first.
 Certainly nature had  here grown and walled a dream garden in which to set a house of dreams.
  So, past midnight, Gilman stood in the sunshine, looking at the face of  the girl he had asked to marry him and who had said that she would;  and a small doubt crept into his heart, and a feeling that perhaps life  might be different for him if Peter Morrison decided to come to Lilac  Valley to build his home.
 Then the sunlight faded, night closed in, but  as he went his homeward way John Gilman was thinking, thinking deeply  and not at all happily.
        .
 The Bear Cat         "Friday's child is loving and giving,       But Saturday's child must work for a living,"    Linda was chanting happily as she entered the kitchen early Saturday  morning.
    "Katy, me blessing," she said gaily, "did I ever point out to you the  interesting fact that I was born on Saturday? And a devilish piece of  luck it was, for I have been hustling ever since.
 It's bad enough to  have been born on Monday and spoiled wash day, but I call Saturday the  vanishing point, the end of the extreme limit.
"    Katy laughed, and, as always, turned adoring eyes on Linda.
    "I am not needing ye, lambie," she said.
 "Is it big business in the  canyon ye're having today? Shall I be ready to be cooking up one of them  God-forsaken Red Indian messes for ye when ye come back?"    Linda held up a warning finger.
    "Hiss, Katy," she said.
 "That is a dark secret.
 Don't you be forgetting  yourself and saying anything like that before anyone, or I would be  ruined entirely.
"    "Well, I did think when ye began it," said Katy, "that of all the wild  foolishness ye and your pa had ever gone through with, that was the  worst, but that last mess ye worked out was so tasty to the tongue that  I thought of it a lot, and I'm kind o' hankering for more.
"    Linda caught Katy and swung her around the kitchen in a wild war dance.
  Her gayest laugh bubbled clear from the joy peak of her soul.
    "Katy," she said, "if you had lain awake all night trying to say  something that would particularly please me, you couldn't have done  better.
 That was a quaint little phrase and a true little phrase, and  I know a little spot that it will fit exactly.
 What am I doing today?  Well, several things, Katy.
 First, anything you need about the house.
  Next, I am going to empty the billiard room and sell some of the excess  furniture of the library, and with the returns I am going to buy me a  rug and a table and some tools to work with, so I won't have to clutter  up my bedroom with my lessons and things I bring in that I want to save.
  And then I am going to sell the technical stuff from the library and use  that money where it will be of greatest advantage to me.
 And then, Katy,  I am going to manicure the Bear Cat and I am going to drive it again.
"    Linda hesitated.
 Katy stood very still, thinking intently, but finally  she said: "That's all right; ye have got good common sense; your nerves  are steady; your pa drilled ye fine.
 Many's the time he has bragged to  me behind your back what a fine little driver he was making of ye.
 I  don't know a girl of your age anywhere that has less enjoyment than ye.
  If it would be giving ye any happiness to be driving that car, ye just  go ahead and drive it, lambie, but ye promise me here and now that  ye will be mortal careful.
 In all my days I don't think I have seen a  meaner-looking little baste of a car.
"    "Of course I'll be careful, Katy," said Linda.
 "That car was not bought  for its beauty.
 Its primal object in this world was to arrive.
 Gee, how  we shot curves, and coasted down the canyons, and gassed up on the level  when some poor soul went batty from nerve strain! The truth is, Katy,  that you can't drive very slowly.
 You have got to go the speed for which  it was built.
 But I have had my training.
 I won't forget.
 I adore that  car, Katy, and I don't know how I have ever kept my fingers off it  this long.
 Today it gets a bath and a facial treatment, and when I have  thought up some way to meet my big problem, you're going to have a ride,  Katy, that will quite uplift your soul.
 We'll go scooting through the  canyons, and whizzing around the mountains, and roaring along the beach,  as slick as a white sea swallow.
"    "Now, easy, lambie, easy," said Katy.
 "Ye're planning to speed that  thing before ye've got it off the jacks.
"    "No, that was mere talk," said Linda.
 "But, Katy, this is my great day.
  I feel in my bones that I shall have enough money by night to get me  some new tires, which I must have before I can start out in safety.
"    "Of course ye must, honey.
 I would just be tickled to pieces to let ye  have what ye need.
"    Linda slid her hand across Katy's lips and gathered her close in her  arms.
    "You blessed old darling," she said.
 "Of course you would, but I don't  need it, Katy.
 I can sit on the floor to work, if I must, and instead of  taking the money from the billiard table to buy a worktable, I can buy  tires with that.
 But here's another thing I want to tell you, Katy.
 This  afternoon a male biped is coming to this house, and he's not coming to  see Eileen.
 His name is Donald Whiting, and when he tells you it is, and  stands very straight and takes off his hat, and looks you in the eye  and says, 'Calling on Miss Linda Strong,' walk him into the living room,  Katy, and seat him in the best chair and put a book beside him and the  morning paper; and don't you forget to do it with a flourish.
 He is  nothing but a high-school kid, but he's the first boy that ever in all  my days asked to come to see me so it's a big event; and I wish to my  soul I had something decent to wear.
"    "Well, with all the clothes in this house," said Katy; and then she  stopped and shut her lips tight and looked at Linda with belligerent  Irish eyes.
    "I know it," nodded Linda in acquiescence; "I know what you think; but  never mind.
 Eileen has agreed to make me a fair allowance the first of  the month, and if that isn't sufficient, I may possibly figure up some  way to do some extra work that will bring me a few honest pennies, so  I can fuss up enough to look feminine at times, Katy.
 In the meantime,  farewell, oh, my belovedest.
 Call me at half-past eight, so I will be  ready for business at nine.
"    Then Linda went to the garage and began operations.
 She turned the hose  on the car and washed the dust from it carefully.
 Then she dried it with  the chamois skins as she often had done before.
 She carefully examined  the cushioning, and finding it dry and hard, she gave it a bath of olive  oil and wiped and manipulated it.
 She cleaned the engine with extreme  care.
 At one minute she was running to Katy for kerosene to pour through  the engine to loosen the carbon.
 At another she was telephoning for the  delivery of oil, gasoline, and batteries for which she had no money to  pay, so she charged them to Eileen, ordering the bill to be sent on the  first of the month.
 It seemed to her that she had only a good start when  Katy came after her.
    The business of appraising the furniture was short, and Linda was well  satisfied with the price she was offered for it.
 After the man had gone  she showed Katy the pieces she had marked to dispose of, and told  her when they would be called for.
 She ate a few bites of lunch while  waiting for the book man, and the results of her business with him quite  delighted Linda.
 She had not known that the value of books had risen  with the price of everything else.
 The man with whom she dealt had known  her father.
 He had appreciated the strain in her nature which made her  suggest that he should number and appraise the books, but she must be  allowed time to go through each volume in order to remove any scraps of  paper or memoranda which her father so frequently left in books to which  he was referring.
 He had figured carefully and he had made Linda a far  higher price than could have been secured by a man.
 As the girl went  back to her absorbing task in the garage, she could see her way clear to  the comforts and conveniences and the material that she needed for her  work.
 When she reached the car she patted it as if it had been a living  creature.
    "Cheer up, nice old thing," she said gaily.
 "I know how to get new tires  for you, and you shall drink all the gasoline and oil your tummy can  hold.
 Now let me see.
 What must I do next? I must get you off your  jacks; and oh, my gracious there are the grease cups, and that's a nasty  job, but it must be done; and what is the use of Saturday if I can't do  it? Daddy often did.
"    Linda began work in utter absorption.
 She succeeded in getting the car  off the jacks.
 She was lying on her back under it, filling some of the  most inaccessible grease cups, and she was softly singing as she worked:    "The shoes I wear are common-sense shoes--"    At that minute Donald Whiting swung down the street, turned in at the  Strong residence, and rang the bell.
 Eileen was coming down the stairs,  dressed for the street.
 She had inquired for Linda, and Katy had told  her that she thought Miss Linda had decided to begin using her car, and  that she was in the garage working on it.
 To Eileen's credit it may be  said that she had not been told that a caller was expected.
 Linda never  before had had a caller and, as always, Eileen was absorbed in her own  concerns.
 Had she got the rouge a trifle brighter on one cheek than on  the other? Was the powder evenly distributed? Would the veil hold the  handmade curls in exactly the proper place? When the bell rang her one  thought might have been that some of her friends were calling for her.
  She opened the door, and when she learned that Linda was being asked  for, it is possible that she mistook the clean, interesting, and  well-dressed youngster standing before her for a mechanic.
 What she said  was: "Linda's working on her car.
 Go around to the left and you will  find her in the garage, and for heaven's sake, get it right before you  let her start out, for we've had enough horror in this family from motor  accidents.
"    Then she closed the door before him and stood buttoning her gloves; a  wicked and malicious smile spreading over her face.
    "Just possibly," she said, "that youngster is from a garage, but if he  is, he's the best imitation of the real thing that I have seen in these  chaotic days.
"    Donald Whiting stopped at the garage door and looked in, before Linda  had finished her grease cups, and in time to be informed that he might  wear common-sense shoes if he chose.
 At his step, Linda rolled her black  head on the cement floor and raised her eyes.
 She dropped the grease  cup, and her face reddened deeply.
    "Oh, my Lord!" she gasped breathlessly.
 "I forgot to tell Katy when to  call me!"    In that instant she also forgot that the stress of the previous four  years had accustomed men to seeing women do any kind of work in any kind  of costume; but soon Linda realized that Donald Whiting was not paying  any particular attention either to her or to her occupation.
 He was  leaning forward, gazing at the car with positively an enraptured  expression on his eager young face.
    "Shades of Jehu!" he cried.
 "It's a Bear Cat!"    Linda felt around her head for the grease cup.
    "Why, sure it's a Bear Cat," she said with the calmness of complete  recovery.
 "And it's just about ready to start for its very own cave in  the canyon.
"    Donald Whiting pitched his hat upon the seat, shook off his coat, and  sent it flying after the hat.
 Then he began unbuttoning and turning back  his sleeves.
    "Here, let me do that," he said authoritatively.
 "Gee! I have never yet  ridden in a Bear Cat.
 Take me with you, will you, Linda?"    "Sure," said Linda, pressing the grease into the cup with a little  paddle and holding it up to see if she had it well filled.
 "Sure, but  there's no use in you getting into this mess, because I have only got  two more.
 You look over the engine.
 Did you ever grind valves, and do  you think these need it?"    "Why, they don't need it," said Donald, "if they were all right when it  was jacked up.
"    "Well, they were," said Linda.
 "It was running like a watch when it went  to sleep.
 But do we dare take it out on these tires?"    "How long has it been?" asked Donald, busy at the engine.
    "All of four years," answered Linda.
    Donald whistled softly and started a circuit of the car, kicking the  tires and feeling them.
    "Have you filled them?" he asked.
    "No," said Linda.
 "I did not want to start the engine until I had  finished everything else.
"    "All right," he said, "I'll look at the valves first and then, if it is  all ready, there ought to be a garage near that we can run to carefully,  and get tuned up.
"    "There is," said Linda.
 "There is one only a few blocks down the street  where Dad always had anything done that he did not want to do himself.
"    "That's that, then," said Donald.
    Linda crawled from under the car and stood up, wiping her hands on a bit  of waste.
    "Do you know what tires cost now?" she asked anxiously.
    "They have 'em at the garage," answered Donald, "and if I were you,  I wouldn't get a set; I would get two.
 I would-put them on the rear  wheels.
 You might be surprised at how long some of these will last.
  Anyway, that would be the thing to do.
"    "Of course," said Linda, in a relieved tone.
 "That would be the thing to  do.
"    "Now," she said, "I must be excused a few minutes till I clean up so I  am fit to go on the streets.
 I hope you won't think I forgot you were  coming.
"        Donald laughed drily.
    "When 'shoes' was the first word I heard," he said, "I did not for a  minute think you had forgotten.
"    "No, I didn't forget," said Linda.
 "What I did do was to become so  excited about cleaning up the car that I let time go faster than I  thought it could.
 That was what made me late.
"    "Well, forget it!" said Donald.
 "Run along and jump into something, and  let us get our tires and try Kitty out.
"    Linda reached up and released the brakes.
 She stepped to one side of the  car and laid her hands on it.
    "Let us run it down opposite the kitchen door," she said, "then you go  around to the front, and I'll let you in, and you can read something a  few minutes till I make myself presentable.
"    "Oh, I'll stay out here and look around the yard and go over the car  again," said the boy.
 "What a bunch of stuff you have got growing here;  I don't believe I ever saw half of it before.
" "It's Daddy's and my  collection," said Linda.
 "Some day I'll show you some of the things, and  tell you how we got them, and why they are rare.
 Today I just naturally  can't wait a minute until I try my car.
"    "Is it really yours?" asked Donald enviously.
    "Yes," said Linda.
 "It's about the only thing on earth that is  peculiarly and particularly mine.
 I haven't a doubt there are improved  models, but Daddy had driven this car only about nine months.
 It was  going smooth as velvet, and there's no reason why it should not keep it  up, though I suspect that by this time there are later models that could  outrun it.
"    "Oh, I don't know," said the boy.
 "It looks like some little old car to  me.
 I bet it can just skate.
"    "I know it can," said Linda, "if I haven't neglected something.
 We'll  start carefully, and we'll have the inspector at the salesrooms look it  over.
"    Then Linda entered the kitchen door to find Katy with everything edible  that the house afforded spread before her on the table.
    "Why, Katy, what are you doing?" she asked.
    "I was makin' ready," explained Katy, "to fix ye the same kind of lunch  I would for Miss Eileen.
 Will ye have it under the live oak, or in the  living room?"    "Neither," said Linda.
 "Come upstairs with me, and in the storeroom  you'll find the lunch case and the thermos bottles and don't stint  yourself, Katy.
 This is a rare occasion.
 It never happened before.
  Probably it will never happen again.
 Let's make it high altitude while  we are at it.
"    "I'll do my very best with what I happen to have," said Katy; "but I  warn you right now I am making a good big hole in the Sunday dinner.
"    "I don't give two whoops," said Linda, "if there isn't any Sunday  dinner.
 In memory of hundreds of times that we have eaten bread and  milk, make it a banquet, Katy, and we'll eat bread and milk tomorrow.
"    Then she took the stairway at a bound, and ran to her room.
 In a  very short time she emerged, clad in a clean blouse and breeches' her  climbing boots, her black hair freshly brushed and braided.
    "I ought to have something," said Linda, "to shade my eyes.
 The  glare's hard on them facing the sun.
"    Going down the hall she came to the storeroom, opened a drawer' and  picked out a fine black felt Alpine hat that had belonged to her father.
  She carried it back to her room and, standing at the glass, tried it on,  pulling it down on one side, turning it up at the other, and striking  a deep cleft across the crown.
 She looked at herself intently for a  minute, and then she reached up and deliberately loosened the hair at  her temples.
    "Not half bad, all things considered, Linda," she said.
 "But, oh, how  you do need a tich of color.
"    She ran down the hall and opened the door to Eileen's room, and going  to her chiffonier, pulled out a drawer containing an array of gloves,  veils, and ribbons.
 At the bottom of the ribbon stack, her eye caught  the gleam of color for which she was searching, and she deftly slipped  out a narrow scarf of Roman stripes with a deep black fringe at the  end.
 Sitting down, she fitted the hat over her knee, picked up the  dressing-table scissors, and ripped off the band.
 In its place she  fitted the ribbon, pinning it securely and knotting the ends so that the  fringe reached her shoulder.
 Then she tried the hat again.
 The result  was blissfully satisfactory.
 The flash of orange, the blaze of red, the  gleam of green, were what she needed.
    "Thank you very much, sister mine," she said, "I know you I would be  perfectly delighted to loan me this.
"        .
 One Hundred Per Cent Plus    Then she went downstairs and walked into the kitchen, prepared for what  she would see, by what she heard as she approached.
    With Katy's apron tied around his waist, Donald Whiting was occupied in  squeezing orange, lemon, and pineapple juice over a cake of ice in a big  bowl, preparatory to the compounding of Katy's most delicious brand of  fruit punch.
 Without a word, Linda stepped to the bread board and  began slicing the bread and building sandwiches, while Katy hurried her  preparations for filling the lunch box.
 A few minutes later Katy packed  them in the car, kissed Linda good-bye, and repeatedly cautioned Donald  to make her be careful.
    As the car rolled down the driveway and into the street, Donald looked  appraisingly at the girl beside him.
    "Is it the prevailing custom in Lilac Valley for young ladies to kiss  the cook?" inquired Donald laughingly.
    "Now, you just hush," said Linda.
 "Katy is NOT the cook, alone.
 Katy's  my father, and my mother, and my family, and my best friend--"    "Stop right there," interposed Donald.
 "That is quite enough for any  human to be.
 Katy's a multitude.
 She came out to the car with the  canteen, and when I offered to help her, without any 'polly foxin',' she  just said: 'Sure.
 Come in and make yourself useful.
' So I went, and I am  expecting amazing results from the job she gave me.
"    "Come to think of it," said Linda, "I have small experience with  anybody's cooking except Katy's and my own, but so far as I know, she  can't very well be beaten.
"    Carefully she headed the car into the garage adjoining the salesrooms.
  There she had an ovation.
 The manager and several of the men remembered  her.
 The whole force clustered around the Bear Cat and began to examine  it, and comment on it, and Linda climbed out and asked to have the  carburetor adjusted, while the mechanic put on a pair of tires.
 When  everything was satisfactory, she backed to the street, and after a few  blocks of experimental driving, she headed for the Automobile Club to  arrange for her license and then turned straight toward Multiflores  Canyon, but she did not fail to call Donald Whiting's attention to every  beauty of Lilac Valley as they passed through.
 When they had reached  a long level stretch of roadway leading to the canyon, Linda glanced  obliquely at the boy beside her.
    "It all comes back as natural as breathing," she said.
 "I couldn't  forget it any more than I could forget how to walk, or to swim.
 Sit  tight.
 I am going to step on the gas for a bit, just for old sake's  sake.
"    "That's all right," said Donald, taking off his hat and giving his head  a toss so that the wind might have full play through his hair.
 "But  remember our tires are not safe.
 Better not go the limit until we get  rid of these old ones, and have a new set all around.
"    Linda settled back in her seat, took a firm grip on the wheel, and  started down the broad, smooth highway, gradually increasing the speed.
  The color rushed to her cheeks.
 Her eyes were gleaming.
    "Listen to it purr!" she cried to Donald.
 "If you hear it begin to  growl, tell me.
"    And then for a few minutes they rode like birds on the path of the wind.
  When they approached the entrance to the canyon, gradually Linda slowed  down.
 She turned an exultant flashing face to Donald Whiting.
    "That was a whizzer," said the boy.
 "I'll tell you I don't know what I'd  give to have a car like this for my very own.
 I'll bet not another girl  in Los Angeles has a car that can go like that.
"    "And I don't believe I have any business with it," said Linda; "but  since circumstances make it mine, I am going to keep it and I am going  to drive it.
"    "Of course you are," said Donald emphatically.
 "Don't you ever let  anybody fool you out of this car, because if they wanted to, it would be  just because they are jealous to think they haven't one that will go as  fast.
"    "There's not the slightest possibility of my giving it up so long as I  can make the engine turn over," she said.
 "I told you how Father always  took me around with him, and there's nothing in this world I am so sure  of as I am sure that I am spoiled for a house cat.
 I have probably less  feminine sophistication than any girl of my age in the world, and I  probably know more about camping and fishing and the scientific why and  wherefore of all outdoors than most of them.
 I just naturally had such  a heavenly time with Daddy that it never has hurt my feelings to be left  out of any dance or party that ever was given.
 The one thing that has  hurt is the isolation.
 Since I lost Daddy I haven't anyone but Katy.
  Sometimes, when I see a couple of nice, interesting girls visiting with  their heads together, a great feeling of envy wells up in my soul, and I  wish with all my heart that I had such a friend.
"    "Ever try to make one?" asked Donald.
 "There are mighty fine girls in  the high school.
"    "I have seen several that I thought I would like to be friends with,"  said Linda, "but I am so lacking in feminine graces that I haven't known  how to make advances, in the first place, and I haven't had the courage,  in the second.
"    "I wish my sister were not so much older than you," said Donald.
    "How old is your sister?" inquired Linda.
    "She will be twenty-three next birthday," said Donald; "and of all the  nice girls you ever saw, she is the queen.
"    "Yes," she assented, "I am sure I have heard your sister mentioned.
 But  didn't you tell me she had been reared for society?"    "No, I did not," said Donald emphatically.
 "I told you Mother j believed  in dressing her as the majority of other girls were dressed, but I  didn't say she had been reared for society.
 She has been reared with an  eye single to making a well-dressed, cultured, and gracious woman.
"    "I call that fine," said Linda.
 "Makes me envious of you.
 Now forget  everything except your eyes and tell me what you see.
 Have you ever been  here before?"    "I have been through a few times before, but seems to me I | never saw  it looking quite so pretty.
"    Linda drove carefully, but presently Donald uttered an exclamation as  she swerved from the road and started down what appeared to be quite a  steep embankment and headed straight for the stream.
    "Sit tight," she said tersely.
 "The Bear Cat just loves its cave.
 It  knows where it is going.
"    She broke through a group of young willows and ran the car! into a tiny  plateau, walled in a circle by the sheer sides of the! canyon reaching  upward almost out of sight, topped with great jagged overhanging  boulders.
 Crowded to one side, she stopped the car and sat quietly,  smiling at Donald Whiting.
    "How about it?" she asked in a low voice.
    The boy looked around him, carefully examining the canyon walls, and  then at the level, odorous floor where one could not step without  crushing tiny flowers of white, cerise, blue, and yellow.
 Big ferns grew  along the walls, here and there "Our Lord's Candles" lifted high torches  not yet lighted, the ambitious mountain stream skipped and circled and  fell over its rocky bed, while many canyon wrens were singing.
    "Do you think," she said, "that anyone driving along here at an ordinary  rate of speed would see that car?"    "No," said Donald, getting her idea, "I don't believe they would.
"        "All right, then," said Linda.
 "Toe up even and I'll race YoU to the  third curve where you see the big white sycamore.
"    Donald had a fleeting impression of a flash of khaki, a gleam of red,  and a wave of black as they started.
 He ran with all the speed he had  ever attained at a track meet.
 He ran with all his might.
 He ran until  his sides strained and his breath came short; but the creature beside  him was not running; she was flying; and long before they neared the  sycamore he knew he was beaten, so he laughingly cried to her to stop  it.
 Linda turned to him panting and laughing.
    "I make that dash every time I come to the canyon, to keep my muscle  up, but this is the first time I have had anyone to race with in a long  time.
"    Then together they slowly walked down the smooth black floor between  the canyon walls.
 As they crossed a small bridge Linda leaned over and  looked down.
    "Anyone at your house care about 'nose twister'?" she asked lightly.
    "Why, isn't that watercress?" asked Donald.
    "Sure it is," said Linda.
 "Anyone at your house like it?"    "Every one of us," answered Donald.
 "We're all batty about cress  salad--and, say, that reminds me of something! If you know so much  about this canyon and everything in it, is there any place in it where  a fellow could find a plant, a kind of salad lettuce, that the Indians  used to use?"    "Might be," said Linda carelessly.
 "For why?"    "Haven't you heard of the big sensation that is being made in feminine  circles by the new department in Everybody's Home?" inquired Donald.
  "Mother and Mary Louise were discussing it the other day at lunch, and  they said that some of the recipes for dishes to be made from stuff the  Indians used sounded delicious.
 One reminded them of cress, and when we  saw the cress I wondered if I could get them some of the other.
"    "Might," said Linda drily, "if you could give me a pretty good idea of  what it is that you want.
"    "When you know cress, it's queer that you wouldn't know other things in  your own particular canyon," said Donald.
    Linda realized that she had overdone her disinterestedness a trifle.
    "I suspect it's miners' lettuce you want," she said.
 "Of course I know  where there's some, but you will want it as fresh as possible if you  take any, so we'll finish our day first and gather it the last thing  before we leave.
"    How it started neither of them noticed, but they had not gone far before  they were climbing the walls and hanging to precarious footings.
 Her  cheeks flushed, her eyes brilliant, her lips laughing, Linda was  showing Donald thrifty specimens of that Cotyledon known as "old hen and  chickens," telling him of the rare Echeveria of the same family, and her  plunge down the canyon side while trying to uproot it, exulting that she  had brought down the plant without a rift in the exquisite bloom on its  leaves.
    Linda told about her fall, and the two men who had passed at that  instant, and how she had met them later, and who they were, and what  they were doing.
 Then Donald climbed high for a bunch of larkspur, and  Linda showed him how to turn his back to the canyon wall and come down  with the least possible damage to his person and clothing.
 When at last  both of them were tired they went back to the car.
 Linda spread an  old Indian blanket over the least flower-grown spot she could select,  brought out the thermos bottles and lunch case, and served their lunch.
  With a glass of fruit punch in one hand and a lettuce sandwich in the  other, Donald smiled at Linda.
    "I'll agree about Katy.
 She knows how," he said appreciatively.
    "Katy is more than a cook," said Linda quietly.
 "She is a human being.
  She has the biggest, kindest heart.
 When anybody's sick or in trouble  she's the greatest help.
 She is honest; she has principles; she is  intelligent.
 In her spare time she reads good books and magazines.
  She knows what is going on in the world.
 She can talk intelligently  on almost any subject.
 It's no disgrace to be a cook.
 If it were, Katy  would be unspeakable.
 Fact is, at the present minute there's no one in  all the world so dear to me as Katy.
 I always talk Irish with her.
"    "Well, I call that rough on your sister," said Donald.
    "Maybe it is," conceded Linda.
 "I suspect a lady wouldn't have i  said that, but Eileen and I are so different.
 She never has made the  slightest effort to prove herself lovable to me, and so I have never  learned to love her.
 Which reminds me--how did you happen to come to the  garage?"    "The very beautiful young lady who opened the door mistook me for a  mechanic.
 She told me I would find you working on your car and for  goodness' sake to see that it was in proper condition before you drove  it.
"    Linda looked at him with wide, surprised eyes in which a trace of  indignation was plainly discernible.
    "Now listen to me," she said deliberately.
 "Eileen is a most  sophisticated young lady.
 If she saw you, she never in this world,  thought you were a mechanic sent from a garage presenting yourself at  our front door.
"    "There might have been a spark of malice in the big blue-gray I eyes  that carefully appraised me," said Donald.
    "Your choice of words is good," said Linda, refilling the punch glass.
  "'Appraise' fits Eileen like her glove.
 She appraises every thing on a  monetary basis, and when she can't figure that it's going to be worth an  appreciable number of dollars and cents to her--'to the garage wid it,'  as Katy would say.
"    When they had finished their lunch Linda began packing the box and  Donald sat watching her.
    "At this point," said Linda, "Daddy always smoked.
 Do you smoke?"    There was a hint of deeper color in the boy's cheeks.
    "I did smoke an occasional cigarette," he said lightly, "up to the day,  not a thousand years ago, when a very emphatic young lady who should  have known, insinuated that it was bad for the nerves, and going on the  presumption that she knew, I haven't smoked a cigarette since and I'm  not going to until I find out whether I can do better work without  them.
"    Linda folded napkins and packed away accessories thoughtfully.
 Then she  looked into the boy's eyes.
    "Now we reach the point of our being here together," she said.
 "It's  time to fight, and I am sorry we didn't go at it gas and bomb the minute  we met.
  You're so different from what I thought you were.
 If anyone had  told me a week ago that you would take off your coat and mess with my  automobile engine, or wear Katy's apron and squeeze lemons in our  kitchen I would have looked him over for Daddy's high sign of hysteria,  at least.
 It's too bad to I have such a good time as I have had this  afternoon, and then end with a fight.
"    "That's nothing," said Donald.
 "You couldn't have had as good a time as  I have had.
 You're like another boy.
 A fellow can be just a fellow with  you, and somehow you make everything you touch mean something it never  meant before.
 You have made me feel that I would be about twice the man  I am if I had spent the time I have wasted in plain jazzing around,  hunting Cotyledon or trap-door spiders' nests.
"    "I get you," said Linda.
 "It's the difference between a girl reared in  an atmosphere of georgette and rouge, and one who has grown up in the  canyons with the oaks and sycamores.
 One is natural and the other is  artificial.
 Most boys prefer the artificial.
"    "I thought I did myself," said Donald, "but today has taught me that I  don't.
 I think, Linda, that you would make the finest friend a fellow  ever had.
 I firmly and finally decline to fight with you; but for God's  sake, Linda, tell me how I can beat that little cocoanut-headed Jap.
"    Linda slammed down the lid to the lunch box.
 Her voice was smooth and  even but there was battle in her eyes and she answered decisively:  "Well, you can't beat him calling him names.
 There is only one way on  God's footstool that you can beat him.
 You can't beat him legislating  against him.
 You can't beat him boycotting him.
 You can't beat him with  any tricks.
 He is as sly as a cat and he has got a whole bag full of  tricks of his own, and he has proved right here in Los Angeles that  he has got a brain that is hard to beat.
 All you can do, and be a man  commendable to your own soul, is to take his subject and put your brain  on it to such purpose that you cut pigeon wings around him.
 What are you  studying in your classes, anyway?"    "Trigonometry, Rhetoric, Ancient History, Astronomy," answered Donald.
    "And is your course the same as his?" inquired Linda.
    "Strangely enough it is," answered Donald.
 "We have been in the same  classes all through high school.
 I think the little monkey--"    "Man, you mean," interposed Linda.
    "'Man,'" conceded Donald.
 "Has waited until I selected my course all the  way through, and then he has announced what he would take.
 He probably  figured that I had somebody with brains back of the course I selected,  and that whatever I studied would be suitable for him.
"    "I haven't a doubt of it," said Linda.
 "They are quick; oh! they are  quick; and they know from their cradles what it is that they have in  the backs of their heads.
 We are not going to beat them driving them to  Mexico or to Canada, or letting them monopolize China.
 That is merely  temporizing.
 That is giving them fertile soil on which to take the best  of their own and the level best of ours, and by amalgamating the two,  build higher than we ever have.
 There is just one way in all this world  that we can beat Eastern civilization and all that it intends to do to  us eventually.
 The white man has dominated by his color so far in the  history of the world, but it is written in the Books that when the men  of color acquire our culture and combine it with their own methods of  living and rate of production, they are going to bring forth greater  numbers, better equipped for the battle of life, than we are.
 When they  have got our last secret, constructive or scientific, they will take it,  and living in a way that we would not, reproducing in numbers we don't,  they will beat us at any game we start, if we don't take warning while  we are in the ascendancy, and keep there.
"    "Well, there is something to think about," said Donald Whiting,  staring past Linda at the side of the canyon as if he had seen the  same handwriting on the wall that dismayed Belshazzar at the feast that  preceded his downfall.
    "I see what you're getting at," he said.
 "I had thought that there might  be some way to circumvent him.
"    "There is!" broke in Linda hastily.
 "There is.
 You can beat him, but you  have got to beat him in an honorable way and in a way that is open to  him as it is to you.
"    "I'll do anything in the world if you will only tell me how," said  Donald.
 "Maybe you think it isn't grinding me and humiliating me  properly.
 Maybe you think Father and Mother haven't warned me.
 Maybe  you think Mary Louise isn't secretly ashamed of me.
 How can I beat him,  Linda?"    Linda's eyes were narrowed to a mere line.
 She was staring at the wall  back of Donald as if she hoped that Heaven would intercede in her favor  and write thereon a line that she might translate to the boy's benefit.
    "I have been watching pretty sharply," she said.
 "Take them as a race,  as a unit--of course there are exceptions, there always are--but the  great body of them are mechanical.
 They are imitative.
 They are not  developing anything great of their own in their own country.
 They are  spreading all over the world and carrying home sewing machines and  threshing machines and automobiles and cantilever bridges and submarines  and aeroplanes--anything from eggbeaters to telescopes.
 They are not  creating one single thing.
 They are not missing imitating everything  that the white man can do anywhere else on earth.
 They are just like the  Germans so far as that is concerned.
"    "I get that, all right enough," said Donald.
 "Now go on.
 What is your  deduction? How the devil am I to beat the best? He is perfect, right  straight along in everything.
"    The red in Linda's cheeks deepened.
 Her eyes opened their widest.
 She  leaned forward, and with her closed fist, pounded the blanket before  him.
    "Then, by gracious," she said sternly, "you have got to do something  new.
 You have got to be perfect, PLUS.
"    "'Perfect, plus?'" gasped Donald.
    "Yes, sir!" said Linda emphatically.
 "You have got to be perfect, plus.
  If he can take his little mechanical brain and work a thing out till he  has got it absolutely right, you have got to go further than that and  discover something pertaining to it not hitherto thought of and start  something NEW.
 I tell you you must use your brains.
 You should be more  than an imitator.
 You must be a creator!"    Donald started up and drew a deep breath.
    "Well, some job I call that," he said.
 "Who do you think I am, the  Almighty?"    "No," said Linda quietly, "you are not.
 You are merely His son, created  in His own image, like Him, according to the Book, and you have got to  your advantage the benefit of all that has been learned down the ages.
  We have got to take up each subject in your course, and to find some  different books treating this same subject.
 We have got to get at it  from a new angle.
 We must dig into higher authorities.
 We have got to  coach you till, when you reach the highest note possible for the parrot,  you can go ahead and embellish it with a few mocking-bird flourishes.
  All Oka Sayye knows how to do is to learn the lesson in his book  perfectly, and he is 100 per cent.
 I have told you what you must do  to add the plus, and you can do it if you are the boy I take you for.
  People have talked about the 'yellow peril' till it's got to be a  meaningless phrase.
 Somebody must wake up to the realization that  it's the deadliest peril that ever has menaced white civilization.
 Why  shouldn't you have your hand in such wonderful work?"    "Linda," said the boy breathlessly, "do you realize that you have been  saying 'we'? Can you help me? Will you help me?"    "No," said Linda, "I didn't realize that I had said 'we.
' I didn't mean  two people, just you and me.
 I meant all the white boys and girls of the  high school and the city and the state and the whole world.
 If we are  going to combat the 'yellow peril' we must combine against it.
 We have  got to curb our appetites and train our brains and enlarge our hearts  till we are something bigger and finer and numerically greater than this  yellow peril.
 We can't take it and pick it up and push it into the sea.
  We are not Germans and we are not Turks.
 I never wanted anything in all  this world worse than I want to see you graduate ahead of Oka Sayye.
 And  then I want to see the white boys and girls of Canada and of England and  of Norway and Sweden and Australia, and of the whole world doing exactly  what I am recommending that you do in your class and what I am doing  personally in my own.
 I have had Japs in my classes ever since I have  been in school, but Father always told me to study them, to play the  game fairly, but to BEAT them in some way, in some fair way, to beat  them at the game they are undertaking.
"    "Well, there is one thing you don't take into consideration," said  Donald.
 "All of us did not happen to be fathered by Alexander Strong.
  Maybe we haven't all got your brains.
"    "Oh, posher!" said Linda.
 "I know of a case where a little Indian was  picked up from a tribal battlefield in South America and brought to this  country and put into our schools, and there was nothing that any  white pupil in the school could do that he couldn't, so long as it was  imitative work.
 You have got to be constructive.
 You have got to work  out some way to get ahead of them; and if you will take the history  of the white races and go over their great achievements in mechanics,  science, art, literature--anything you choose--when a white man is  constructive, when he does create, he can simply cut circles around  the colored races.
 The thing is to get the boys and girls of today to  understand what is going on in the world, what they must do as their  share in making the world safe for their grandchildren.
 Life is a  struggle.
 It always has been.
 It always will be.
 There is no better  study than to go into the canyons or the deserts and efface yourself  and watch life.
 It's an all-day process of the stronger annihilating  the weaker.
 The one inexorable thing in the world is Nature.
 The eagle  dominates the hawk; the hawk, the falcon; the falcon, the raven; and  so on down to the place where the hummingbird drives the moth from his  particular trumpet flower.
 The big snake swallows the little one.
 The  big bear appropriates the desirable cave.
"    "And is that what you are recommending people to do?"    "No," said Linda, "it is not.
 That is wild.
 We go a step ahead of the  wild, or we ourselves become wild.
 We have brains, and with our brains  we must do in a scientific way what Nature does with tooth and claw.
  In other words, and to be concrete, put these things in the car while  I fold the blanket.
 We'll gather our miners' lettuce and then we'll go  home and search Daddy's library and see if there is anything bearing in  a higher way on any subject you are taking, so that you can get from it  some new ideas, some different angle, some higher light, something  that will end in speedily prefacing Oka Sayye's perfect with your  pluperfect!"        .
 Katy to the Rescue    Linda delivered Donald Whiting at his door with an armload of books  and a bundle of miners' lettuce and then drove to her home in Lilac  Valley--in the eye of the beholder on the floor-level macadam road; in  her own eye she scarcely grazed it.
 The smooth, easy motion of the car,  the softly purring engine were thrilling.
 The speed at which she was  going was like having wings on her body.
 The mental stimulus she had  experienced in concentrating her brain on Donald Whiting's problem had  stimulated her imagination.
 The radiant color of spring; the chilled,  perfumed, golden air; the sure sense of having found a friend, had  ruffled the plumes of her spirit.
 On the home road Donald had plainly  indicated that he would enjoy spending the morrow with her, and she had  advised him to take the books she had provided and lock himself in his  room and sweat out some information about Monday's lessons which would  at least arrest his professor's attention, and lead his mind to the  fact that something was beginning to happen.
 And then she had laughingly  added: "Tomorrow is Katy's turn.
 I told the old dear I would take her as  soon as I felt the car was safe.
 Every day she does many things that she  hopes will give me pleasure.
 This is one thing I can do that I know will  delight her.
"    "Next Saturday, then?" questioned Donald.
 And Linda nodded.
        "Sure thing.
 I'll be thinking up some place extra interesting.
 Come  in the morning if you want, and we'll take a lunch and go for the day.
  Which do you like best, mountains or canyons or desert or sea?"    "I like it best wherever what you're interested in takes you," said  Donald simply.
    "All right, then," answered Linda, "we'll combine business and  pleasure.
"    So they parted with another meeting arranged.
    When she reached home she found Katy tearfully rejoicing, plainly  revealing how intensely anxious she had been.
 But when Linda told  her that the old tires had held, that the car ran wonderfully, that  everything was perfectly safe, that she drove as unconsciously as she  breathed, and that tomorrow Katy was to go for a long ride, her joy was  incoherent.
    Linda laughed.
 She patted Katy and started down the hallway, when she  called back: "What is this package?"    "A delivery boy left it special only a few minutes ago.
 Must be  something Miss Eileen bought and thought she would want tomorrow, and  then afterward she got this invitation and went on as she was.
"    Linda stood gazing at the box.
 It did look so suspiciously like a dress  box.
    "Katy," she said, "I have just about got an irresistible impulse to  peep.
 I was telling Eileen last night of a dress I saw that I thought  perfect.
 It suited me better than any other dress I ever did see.
 It was  at 'The Mode.
' This box is from 'The Mode.
' Could there be a possibility  that she sent it up specially for me?"    "I think she would put your name on it if she meant it for ye," said  Katy.
    "One peep would show me whether it is my dress or not," said Linda, "and  peep I'm going to.
"    She began untying the string.
    "There's one thing," said Katy, "Miss Eileen's sizes would never fit  ye.
"    "Might," conceded Linda.
 "I am taller than she is, but I could wear her  waists if I wanted to, and she always alters her skirts herself to save  the fees.
 Glory be! This is my dress, and there's a petticoat and  stockings to match it.
 Why, the nice old thing! I suggested hard enough,  but in my heart I hardly thought she would do it.
 Oh, dear, now if I  only had some shoes, and a hat.
"    Linda was standing holding the jacket in one hand, the stockings in the  other, her face flaming.
 Katy drew herself to full height.
 She reached  over and picked the things from Linda's fingers.
    "If ye know that is your dress, lambie," she said authoritatively, "ye  go right out and get into that car and run to town and buy ye a pair of  shoes.
"    "But I have no credit anywhere and I have no money, yet," said Linda.
    "Well, I have," said Katy, "and this time ye're going to stop your  stubbornness and take enough to get ye what you need.
 Ye go to the best  store in Los Angeles and come back here with a pair of shoes that just  match those stockings, and ye go fast, before the stores close.
 If ye've  got to speed a little, do it in the country and do it judacious.
"    "Katy, you're arriving!" cried Linda.
 "'Judicious speeding' is one thing  I learned better than any other lesson about driving a motor car.
 Three  fourths of the driving Father and I did we were speeding judiciously.
"    Katy held the skirt to Linda's waist.
    "Well, maybe it's a little shorter than any you have been wearing, but  it ain't as short as Eileen and all the rest of the girls your age have  them, so that's all right, honey.
 Slip on your coat.
"    Katy's fingers were shaking as she lifted the jacket and Linda slipped  into it.
    "Oh, Lord," she groaned, "ye can't be wearing that! The sleeves don't  come much below your elbows.
"    "You will please to observe," said Linda, "that they are flowing sleeves  and they are not intended to come below the elbows; but it's a piece of  luck I tried it on, for it reminds me that it's a jacket suit and I  must have a blouse.
 When you get the shoe money, make it enough for  a blouse--two blouses, Katy, one for school and one to fuss up in a  little.
"    Without stopping to change her clothing, Linda ran to the garage and  hurried back to the city.
 It was less than an hour's run, but she made  it in ample time to park her car and buy the shoes.
 She selected a pair  of low oxfords of beautiful color, matching the stockings.
 Then she  hurried to one of the big drygoods stores and bought the two waists and  an inexpensive straw hat that would harmonize with the suit; a hat small  enough to stick, in the wind, with brim enough to shade her eyes.
 In  about two hours she was back with Katy and they were in her room trying  on the new clothing.
    "It dumbfounds me," said Linda, "to have Eileen do this for me.
"    She had put on the shoes and stockings, a plain georgette blouse of  a soft, brownish wood-gray, with a bit of heavy brown silk embroidery  decorating the front, and the jacket.
 The dress was of silky changeable  tricolette, the skirt plain.
 Where a fold lifted and was strongly  lighted, it was an exquisite silver-gray; where a shadow fell deeply  it was gray-brown.
 The coat reached half way to the knees.
 It had a  rippling skirt with a row of brown embroidery around it, a deep belt  with double buttoning at the waistline, and collar and sleeves in a more  elaborate pattern of the same embroidery as the skirt.
 Linda perched the  hat on her head, pulled it down securely, and faced Katy.
    "Now then!" she challenged.
    "And it's a perfect dress!" said Katy proudly, "and you're just the  colleen to wear it.
 My, but I wisht your father could be seeing ye the  now.
"    With almost reverent hands Linda removed the clothing and laid it away.
  Then she read a letter from Marian that was waiting for her, telling  Katy scraps of it in running comment as she scanned the sheets.
    "She likes her boarding place.
 There are nice people in it.
 She has got  a wonderful view from the windows of her room.
 She is making friends.
  She thinks one of the men at Nicholson and Snow's is just fine; he is  helping her all he can, on the course she is taking.
 And she wants us  to look carefully everywhere for any scrap of paper along the hedge or  around the shrubbery on the north side of the house.
 One of her three  sheets of plans is missing.
 I don't see where in the world it could have  gone, Katy.
"    Katy spread out her hands in despair.
    "There was not a scrap of a sheet of paper in the room when I cleaned  it," she said, "not a scrap.
 And if I had seen a sheet flying around the  yard I would have picked it up.
 She just must be mistaken about having  lost it here.
 She must have opened her case on the train and lost it  there.
"    Linda shook her head.
    "I put that stuff in the case myself," she said, "and the clothes on top  of it, and she wouldn't have any reason for taking those things out on  the train.
 I can't understand, but she did have three rough sketches.
  She had her heart set on winning that prize and it would be a great help  to her, and certainly it was the most comprehensive and convenient plan  for a house of that class that I ever have seen.
 If I ever have a house,  she is going to plan it, even if she doesn't get to plan John Gilman's  as he always used to say that she should.
 And by the way, Katy, isn't  it kind of funny for Eileen to go away over Sunday when it's his only  holiday?"    "Oh, she'll telephone him," said Katy, "and very like, he'll go down, or  maybe he is with her.
 Ye needn't waste any sympathy on him.
 Eileen will  take care that she has him so long as she thinks she wants him.
"    Later it developed that Eileen had secured the invitation because she  was able to produce three most eligible men.
 Not only was John Gilman  with the party, but Peter Morrison and Henry Anderson were there as  well.
 It was in the nature of a hastily arranged celebration, because  the deal for three acres of land that Peter Morrison most coveted on the  small plateau, mountain walled, in Lilac Valley, was in escrow.
 He had  made a payment on it.
 Anderson was working on his plans.
 Contractors had  been engaged, and on Monday work would begin.
 The house was to be built  as soon as possible, and Peter Morrison had arranged that the garage was  to be built first.
 This he meant to occupy as a residence so that he  could be on hand to superintend the construction of the new home and to  protect, as far as possible, the natural beauty and the natural growth  of the location.
    Early Sunday morning Linda and Katy, with a full lunch box and a full  gasoline tank, slid from the driveway and rolled down the main street of  Lilac Valley toward the desert.
    "We'll switch over and strike San Fernando Road," said Linda, "and I'll  scout around Sunland a bit and see if I can find anything that will  furnish material for another new dish.
"    That day was wonderful for Katy.
 She trotted after Linda over sandy  desert reaches, along the seashore, up mountain trails, and through  canyons connected by long stretches of motoring that was more like  flying than riding.
 She was tired but happy when she went to bed.
 Monday  morning she was an interested spectator as Linda dressed for school.
    "Sure, and hasn't the old chrysalis opened up and let out the nicest  little lady-bird moth, Katy?" inquired Linda as she smoothed her  gray-gold skirts.
 "I think myself that this dress is a trifle too good  for school.
 When I get my allowance next week I think I'll buy me a  cloth skirt and a couple of wash waists and save this for better; but it  really was good of Eileen to take so much pains and send it to me, when  she was busy planning a trip.
"    Katy watched Linda go, and she noted the new light in her eyes, the new  lift of her head, and the proud sureness of her step, and she wondered  if a new dress could do all that for a girl, she scarcely believed that  it could.
 And, too, she had very serious doubts about the dress.
 She  kept thinking of it during the day, and when Eileen came, in the middle  of the afternoon, at the first words on her lips: "Has my dress come?"  Katy felt a wave of illness surge through her.
 She looked at Eileen so  helplessly that that astute reader of human nature immediately Suspected  something.
    "I sent it special," she said, "because I didn't know at the time that I  was going to Riverside and I wanted to work on it.
 Isn't it here yet?"    Then Katy prepared to do battle for the child of her heart.
    "Was the dress ye ordered sent the one Miss Linda was telling ye about?"  she asked tersely.
    "Yes, it was," said Eileen.
 "Linda has got mighty good taste.
 Any dress  she admired was sure to be right.
 She said there was a beautiful dress  at 'The Mode'.
 I went and looked, and sure enough there was, a perfect  beauty.
"    "But she wanted the dress for herself," said Katy.
    "It was not a suitable dress for school," said Eileen.
    "Well, it strikes me," said Katy, "that it was just the spittin' image  of fifty dresses I've seen ye wear to school.
    "What do you know about it?" demanded Eileen.
    "I know just this," said Katy with determination.
 "Ye've had one new  dress in the last few days and you're not needin' another.
 The blessed  Virgin only knows when Miss Linda's had a dress.
 She thought ye'd done  yourself proud and sent it for her, and she put it on, and a becoming  and a proper thing it was too! I advanced her the money myself and sent  her to get some shoes to match it since she had her car fixed and could  go in a hurry.
 A beautiful dress it is, and on her back this minute it  is!"    Eileen was speechless with anger.
 Her face was a sickly white and the  rouge spots on her cheeks stood a glaring admission.
    "Do you mean to tell me--" she gasped.
    "Not again," said the daughter of Erin firmly, "because I have already  told ye wance.
 Linda's gone like a rag bag since the Lord knows when.
  She had a right to the dress, and she thought it was hers, and she took  it.
 And if ye ever want any more respect or obedience or love from the  kiddie, ye better never let her know that ye didn't intend it for her,  for nothing was ever quite so fair and right as that she should have it;  and while you're about it you'd better go straight to the store and get  her what she is needin' to go with it, or better still, ye had better  give her a fair share of the money of which there used to be such a  plenty, and let her get her things herself, for she's that tasty nobody  can beat her when she's got anything to do with.
"    Eileen turned on Katy in a gust of fury.
    "Katherine O'Donovan," she said shrilly, "pack your trunk and see how  quick you can get out of this house.
 I have stood your insolence for  years, and I won't endure it a minute longer!"    Katy folded her red arms and lifted her red chin, and a steel-blue light  flashed from her steel-gray eyes.
    "Humph!" she said, "I'll do nothing of the sort.
 I ain't working for ye  and I never have been no more than I ever worked for your mother.
 Every  lick I ever done in this house I done for Linda and Doctor Strong and  for nobody else.
 Half of this house and everything in it belongs to  Linda, and it's a mortal short time till she's of age to claim it.
  Whichever is her half, that half I'll be staying in, and if ye manage so  as she's got nothing to pay me, I'll take care of her without pay till  the day comes when she can take care of me.
 Go to wid ye, ye triflin',  lazy, self-possessed creature.
 Ten years I have itched to tell ye what I  thought of ye, and now ye know it.
"    As Katy's rage increased, Eileen became intimidated.
 Like every  extremely selfish person she was a coward in her soul.
    "If you refuse to go on my orders," she said, "I'll have John Gilman  issue his.
"    Then Katy set her left hand on her left hip, her lower jaw shot past the  upper, her doubled right fist shook precious near the tip of Eileen's  exquisite little nose.
    "I'm darin' ye," she shouted.
 "I'm just darin' ye to send John Gilman  in the sound of my voice.
 If ye do, I'll tell him every mean and selfish  thing ye've done to me poor lambie since the day of the Black Shadow.
  Send him to me? Holy Mither, I wish ye would! If ever I get my chance at  him, don't ye think I won't be tellin' him what he has lost, and what he  has got? And as for taking orders from him, I am taking my orders from  the person I am working for, and as I told ye before, that's Miss Linda.
  Be off wid ye, and primp up while I get my supper, and mind ye this, if  ye tell Miss Linda ye didn't mean that gown for her and spoil the happy  day she has had, I won't wait for ye to send John Gilman to me; I'll  march straight to him.
 Put that in your cigarette and smoke it! Think  I've lost me nose as well as me sense?"    Then Katy started a triumphal march to the kitchen and cooled down by  the well-known process of slamming pots and pans for half an hour.
 Soon  her Irish sense of humor came to her rescue.
    "Now, don't I hear myself telling Miss Linda a few days ago to kape her  temper, and to kape cool, and to go aisy.
 Look at the aise of me when I  got started.
 By gracious, wasn't I just itching to wallop her?"    Then every art that Katy possessed was bent to the consummation of  preparing a particularly delicious dinner for the night.
    Linda came in softly humming something to herself about the kind of  shoes that you might wear if you chose.
 She had entered the high school  that morning with an unusually brilliant color.
 Two or three girls, who  never had noticed her before, had nodded to her that morning, and one or  two had said: "What a pretty dress you have!" She had caught the  flash of approval in the eyes of Donald Whiting, and she had noted the  flourish with which he raised his hat when he saw her at a distance, and  she knew what he meant when he held up a book, past the covers of which  she could see protruding a thick fold of white paper.
 He had foresworn  whatever pleasure he might have thought of for Sunday.
 He had prepared  notes on some subject that he thought would further him.
 The lift of his  head, the flourish of his hat, and the book all told Linda that he had  struggled and that he felt the struggle had brought an exhilarating  degree of success.
 That had made the day particularly bright for Linda.
  She had gone home with a feeling of uplift and exultation in her heart.
  As she closed the front door she cried up the stairway: "Eileen, are you  there?"    "Yes," answered a rather sulky voice from above.
    Linda ascended, two steps at a bound.
    "Thank you over and over, old thing!" she cried as she raced down the  hallway.
 "Behold me! I never did have a more becoming dress, and Katy  loaned me money, till my income begins, to get shoes and a little scuff  hat to go with it.
 Aren't I spiffy?"    She pirouetted in the doorway.
 Eileen gripped the brush she was  wielding, tight.
    "You have good taste," she said.
 "It's a pretty dress, but You're always  howling about things being suitable.
 Do you call that suitable for  school?"    "It certainly is an innovation for me," said Linda, "but there are  dozens of dresses of the same material, only different cut and colors  in the high school today.
 As soon as I get my money I'll buy a skirt and  some blouses so I won't have to wear this all the time; but I surely do  thank you very much, and I surely have had a lovely day.
 Did you have a  nice time at Riverside?"    Eileen slammed down the brush and turned almost a distorted face to  Linda.
 She had temper to vent.
 In the hour's reflection previous to  Linda's coming, she realized that she had reached the limit with Katy.
  If she antagonized her by word or look, she would go to John Gilman, and  Eileen dared not risk what she would say.
    "No, I did not have a lovely time," she said.
 "I furnished the men for  the party and I expected to have a grand time, but the first thing we  did was to run into that inflated egotist calling herself Mary Louise  Whiting, and like a fool, Janie Brunson introduced her to Peter  Morrison.
 I had paired him with Janie on purpose to keep my eye on him.
"    Linda tried hard but she could not suppress a chuckle: "Of course you  would!" she murmured softly.
    Eileen turned her back.
 That had been her first confidence to Linda.
  She was so aggrieved at that moment that she could have told unanswering  walls her tribulations.
 It would have been better if she had done  so.
 She might have been able to construe silence as sympathy.
 Linda's  laughter she knew exactly how to interpret.
 "Served you right," was what  it meant.
    "I hadn't the least notion you would take an interest in anything  concerning me," she said.
 "People can talk all they please about Mary  Louise Whiting being a perfect lady but she is a perfect beast.
 I have  met her repeatedly and she has always ignored me, and yesterday she  singled out for her special attention the most desirable man in my  party--"    "'Most desirable,'" breathed Linda.
 "Poor John! I see his second fiasco.
  Lavender crystals, please!"    Eileen caught her lip in mortification.
 She had not intended to say what  she thought.
    "Well, you can't claim," she hurried on to cover her confusion, "that it  was not an ill-bred, common trick for her to take possession of a man  of my party, and utterly ignore me.
 She has everything on earth that I  want; she treats me like a dog, and she could give me a glorious time by  merely nodding her head.
"    "I am quite sure you are mistaken," said Linda.
 "From what I've heard of  her, she wouldn't mistreat anyone.
 Very probably what she does is merely  to feel that she is not acquainted with you.
 You have an unfortunate  way, Eileen, of defeating your own ends.
 If you wanted to attract Mary  Louise Whiting, you missed the best chance you ever could have had, at  three o'clock Saturday afternoon, when you maliciously treated her only  brother as you would a mechanic, ordered him to our garage, and shut our  door in his face.
"    Eileen turned to Linda.
 Her mouth fell open.
 A ghastly greenish white  flooded her face.
    "What do you mean?" she gasped.
    "I mean," said Linda, "that Donald Whiting was calling on me, and you  purposely sent him to the garage.
"    Crash down among the vanities of Eileen's dressing table went her lovely  head, and she broke into deep and violent sobs.
 Linda stood looking at  her a second, slowly shaking her head.
 Then she turned and went to her  room.
    Later in the evening she remembered the Roman scarf and told Eileen  of what she had done, and she was unprepared for Eileen's reply: "That  scarf always was too brilliant for me.
 You're welcome to it if you want  it.
"    "Thank you," said Linda gravely, "I want it very much indeed.
"        .
 Assisting Providence    Linda went to the library to see to what state of emptiness it had been  reduced by the removal of several pieces of furniture she had ordered  taken away that day.
 As she stood on the threshold looking over the  room as usual, a throb of loving appreciation of Katy swept through her  heart.
 Katy had been there before her.
 The room had been freshly  swept and dusted, the rugs had been relaid, the furniture rearranged  skilfully, and the table stood at the best angle to be lighted either  by day or night.
 On the table and the mantel stood big bowls of lovely  fresh flowers.
 Linda was quite certain that anyone entering the room for  the first time would have felt it completely furnished, and she doubted  if even Marian would notice the missing pieces.
 Cheered in her heart,  she ran up to the billiard room, and there again Katy had preceded  her.
 The windows were shining.
 The walls and floor had been cleaned.
  Everything was in readiness for the new furniture.
 Her heart full of  gratitude, Linda went to her room, prepared her lessons for the next  day, and then drew out her writing materials to answer Marian's letter.
  She wrote:    I have an acute attack of enlargement of the heart.
 So many things  have happened since your leaving.
 But first I must tell you about your  sketch.
 We just know you did not leave it here.
 Katy says there was not  a scrap in our bedroom when she cleaned it; and as she knows you make  plans and how precious they are to you, I guarantee she would have saved  it if she had found anything looking like a parallelogram on a piece of  paper.
 And I have very nearly combed the lawn, not only the north side,  but the west, south, and east; and then I broke the laws and went over  to your house and crawled through a basement window and worked my way  up, and I have hunted every room in it, but there is nothing there.
 You  must have lost that sketch after you reached San Francisco.
 I hope to  all that's peaceful you did not lay it down in the offices of Nicholson  and Snow, or where you take your lessons.
 I know nothing about  architecture, but I do know something about comfort in a home, and I  thought that was the most comfortable and convenient-looking house I  ever had seen.
    Now I'll go on and tell you all the news, and I don't know which is  the bigger piece to burst on you first.
 Would you be more interested in  knowing that Peter Morrison has bought three acres on the other side of  the valley from us and up quite a way, or in the astonishing fact that I  have a new dress, a perfect love of a dress, really too good for school?  You know there was blood in my eye when you left, and I didn't wait long  to start action.
 I have managed to put the fear of God into Eileen's  heart so that she has agreed to a reasonable allowance for me from the  first of next month; but she must have felt at least one small wave of  contrition when I told her about a peculiarly enticing dress I had seen  at The Mode.
 She sent it up right away, and Katy, blessed be her loving  footprints, loaned me money to buy a blouse and some shoes to match,  so I went to school today looking very like the Great General Average,  minus rouge, lipstick, hairdress, and French heels.
    I do hope you will approve of two things I have done.
    Then Linda recounted the emptying of the billiard room, the inroads in  the library, the listing of the technical books, and what she proposed  to do with the money.
 And then, her face slightly pale and her fingers  slightly trembling, she wrote:    And, Marian dear, I hope you won't be angry with me when I tell you  that I have put the Bear Cat into commission and driven it three times  already.
 It is running like the feline it is, and I am being as careful  as I can.
 I know exactly how you will feel.
 It is the same feeling that  has held me all these months, when I wouldn't even let myself think  of it.
 But something happened at school one day, Marian.
 You know the  Whitings? Mary Louise Whiting's brother is in the senior class.
 He is  a six-footer, and while he is not handsome he is going to be a real man  when he is fully developed, and steadied down to work.
 One day last  week he made it his business to stop me in the hall and twit me about  my shoes, and incidentally to ask me why I didn't dress like the other  girls; and some way it came rougher than if it had been one of the  girls.
 The more I thought about it the more wronged I felt, so I ended  in a young revolution that is to bring me an income, a suitable place to  work in and has brought me such a pretty dress.
 I think it has brought  Eileen to a sense of at least partial justice about money, and it  brought me back the Bear Cat.
 You know the proudest moment of my life  was when Father would let me drive the little beast, and it all came  back as natural as breathing.
 Please don't worry, Marian.
 Nothing shall  happen, I promise you.
    It won't be necessary to tell you that Katy is her darling old self,  loyal and steadfast as the sun, and quite as necessary and as comforting  to me.
 And I have a couple of other interests in life that are going  to--I won't say make up for your absence, because nothing could do  that--but they are going to give me something interesting to think  about, something agreeable to work at, while you are gone.
 But, oh,  Marian, do hurry.
 Work all day and part of the night.
 Be Saturday's  child yourself if you must, just so you get home quick, and where your  white head makes a beacon light for the truest, lovingest pal you will  ever have,                                                     LINDA.
    Linda laid down the pen, slid down in her chair, and looked from the  window across the valley, and she wondered if in her view lay the  location that had been purchased by Peter Morrison.
 She glanced back at  her letter and sat looking at the closing lines and the signature.
    "Much good that will do her," she commented.
 "When a woman loves a man  and loves him with all her heart, as Marian loved John, and when she  loses him, not because she has done a single unworthy thing herself,  but because he is so rubber spined that he will let another woman  successfully intrigue him, a lot of comfort she is going to get from the  love of a schoolgirl!"    Linda's eyes strayed to the window again, and traveled down to the city  and up the coast, all the way to San Francisco, and out of the thousands  of homes there they pictured a small, neat room, full of Marian's  belongings, and Marian herself bending over a worktable, absorbed in the  final draft of her precious plans.
 Linda could see Marian as plainly as  she ever had seen her, but she let her imagination run, and she fancied  that when Marian was among strangers and where no one knew of John  Gilman's defection, that hers might be a very heavy heart, that hers  might be a very sad face.
 Then she went to planning.
 She had been  desolate, heart hungry, and isolated herself.
 First she had endured,  then she had fought; the dawn of a new life was breaking over her hill.
  She had found work she was eager to do.
 She could put the best of her  brain, the skill of her fingers, the creative impulse of her heart, into  it.
    She was almost sure that she had found a friend.
 She had a feeling that  when the coming Saturday had been lived Donald Whiting would be her  friend.
 He would want her advice and her help in his work.
 She would  want his companionship and the stimulus of his mind, in hers.
 What Linda  had craved was a dear friend among the girls, but no girl had offered  her friendship.
 This boy had, so she would accept what the gods of  time and circumstance provided.
 It was a very wonderful thing that had  happened to her.
 Now why could not something equally wonderful happen to  Marian? Linda wrinkled her brows and thought deeply.
    "It's the worst thing in all this world to work and work with nobody to  know about it and nobody to care," thought Linda.
 "Marian could break a  record if she thought John Gilman cared now as he used to.
 It's almost  a necessary element to her success.
 If he doesn't care, she ought to be  made to feel that somebody cares.
 This thing of standing alone, since  I have found a friend, appeals to me as almost insupportable.
 Let me  think.
"    It was not long until she had worked out a scheme for putting an  interest in Marian's life and giving her something for which to work,  until a more vital reality supplanted it.
 The result was that she took  some paper, went down to the library, and opening the typewriter, wrote  a letter.
 She read it over, making many changes and corrections, and  then she copied it carefully.
 When she came to addressing it she was  uncertain, but at last she hit upon a scheme of sending it in the care  of Nicholson and Snow because Marian had told her that she meant to  enter their contest immediately she reached San Francisco, and she would  have left them her address.
 On the last reading of the letter she had  written, she decided that it was a manly, straightforward production,  which should interest and attract any girl.
 But how was she to sign  it? After thinking deeply for a long time, she wrote "Philip Sanders,  General Delivery," and below she added a postscript:    To save you the trouble of inquiring among your friends as to who Philip  Sanders is, I might as well tell you in the beginning that he isn't.
 He  is merely an assumption under which I shall hide my personality until  you let me know whether it is possible that you could become even  slightly interested in me, as a small return for the very deep and  wholesome interest abiding in my heart for you.
    "Abiding," said Linda aloud.
 "It seems to me that there is nothing in  all the world quite so fine as a word.
 Isn't 'abiding' a good word?  Doesn't it mean a lot? Where could you find one other word that  means being with you and also means comforting you and loving you  and sympathizing with you and surrounding you with firm walls and a  cushioned floor and a starry roof? I love that word.
 I hope it impresses  Marian with all its wonderful meaning.
"    She went back to her room, put both letters into her Geometry, and  in the morning mailed them.
 She stood a long time hesitating with the  typewritten letter in her hand, but finally dropped it in the letter box  also.
    "It will just be something," she said, "to make her think that some man  appreciates her lovely face and doesn't care if her hair is white, and  sees how steadfast and fine she is.
"    And then she slowly repeated, "'steadfast,' that is another fine word.
  It has pearls and rubies all over it.
"    After school that evening she visited James Brothers' and was paid the  full amount of the appraisement of her furniture.
 Then she went to an  art store and laid in a full supply of the materials she needed for the  work she was trying to do.
 Her fingers were trembling as she handled the  boxes of water colors and selected the brushes and pencils for her work,  and sheets of drawing paper upon which she could do herself justice.
  When the transaction was finished, she had a few dollars remaining.
 As  she put them in her pocket she said softly:    "That's gasoline.
 Poor Katy! I'm glad she doesn't need her money,  because she is going to have to wait for the allowance or the sale of  the books or on Jane Meredith.
 But it's only a few days now, so that'll  be all right.
"        .
 The Lay of the Land    Linda entered the street car for her daily ride to Lilac Valley.
 She  noticed Peter Morrison and Henry Anderson sitting beside each other,  deeply engrossed in a drawing.
 She had been accustomed to ride in the  open section of the car as she liked the fresh air.
 She had a fleeting  thought of entering the body of the car and sitting where they would see  her; and then a perverse spirit in Linda's heart said to her:    "That is precisely what Eileen would do.
 You sit where you belong.
"    Whereupon Linda dropped into the first vacant seat she could reach, but  it was only a few moments before Peter Morrison, looking up from the  plans he was studying, saw her, and lifting his hat, beckoned her to  come and sit with him.
 They made room for her between them and spreading  the paper across her lap, all three of them began to discuss the plans  for the foundation for Peter's house.
 Anderson had roughly outlined the  grounds, sketching in the trees that were to be saved, the spring, and  the most available route for reaching the road.
 The discussion was as to  where the road should logically enter the grounds, and where the garage  should stand.
    "Which reminds me," said Linda--"haven't you your car with you? Or was  that a hired one you were touring in?"    "Mine," said Peter Morrison, "but we toured so far, it's in the shop for  a general overhauling today.
"    "That being the case," said Linda, "walk home with me and I'll take you  to your place in mine and bring you back to the cars, if you only want  to stay an hour or two.
"    "Why, that would be fine," said Peter.
 "You didn't mention, the other  evening, that you had a car.
"    "No," said Linda, "I had been trying to keep cars out of my thought for  a long time, but I could endure it no longer the other day, so I got  mine out and tuned it up.
 If you don't mind stacking up a bit, three can  ride in it very comfortably.
"    That was the way it happened that Linda walked home after school that  afternoon between Peter Morrison and his architect, brought out the Bear  Cat, and drove them to Peter's location.
    All that day, workmen had been busy under the management of a  well-instructed foreman, removing trees and bushes and stones  and clearing the spot that had been selected for the garage and  approximately for the house.
    The soft brownish gray of Linda's dress was exactly the color to  intensify the darker brown of her eyes.
 There was a fluctuating red in  her olive cheeks, a brilliant red framing her even white teeth.
 Once  dressed so that she was satisfied with the results, Linda immediately  forgot her clothes, and plunged into Morrison's plans.
    "Peter," she said gravely, with Peter perfectly cognizant of the twinkle  in her dark eyes, "Peter, you may save money in a straight-line road,  but you're going to sin against your soul if you build it.
 You'll have  to economize in some other way, and run your road around the base of  those boulders, then come in straight to the line here, and then you  should swing again and run out on this point, where guests can have one  bewildering glimpse of the length of our blue valley, and then whip them  around this clump of perfumy lilac and elders, run them to your side  entrance, and then scoot the car back to the garage.
 I think you should  place the front of your house about here.
" Linda indicated where.
 "So  long as you're buying a place like this you don't want to miss one  single thing; and you do want to make the very most possible out of  every beauty you have.
 And you mustn't fail to open up and widen the  runway from that energetic, enthusiastic spring.
 Carry it across your  road, sure.
 It will cost you another little something for a safe bridge,  but there's nothing so artistic as a bridge with a cold stream running  under it.
 And think what a joyful time I'll have, gathering specimens  for you of every pretty water plant that grows in my particular canyon.
  Any time when you're busy in your library and you hear my car puffing up  the incline and around the corner and rattling across the bridge, you'll  know that I am down here giving you a start of watercress and miners'  lettuce and every lovely thing you could mention that likes to be  nibbled or loved-up, while it dabbles its toes in the water.
"    Peter Morrison looked at Linda reflectively.
 He looked for such a long  moment that Henry Anderson reached a nebulous conclusion.
 "Fine!" he  cried.
 "Every one of those suggestions is valuable to an inexperienced  man.
 Morrison, shan't I make a note of them?"    "Yes, Henry, you shall," said Peter.
 "I am going to push this thing as  fast as possible, so far as building the garage is concerned and getting  settled in it.
 After that I don't care if I live on this spot until we  know each other by the inch, before I begin building my home.
 At the  present minute it appeals to me that 'home' is about the best word in  the language of any nation.
 I have a feeling that what I build here is  going to be my home, very possibly the only one I shall ever have.
 We  must find the spot on which the Lord intended that a house should grow  on this hillside, and then we must build that house so that it has  a room suitable for a workshop in which I may strive, under the best  conditions possible, to get my share of the joy of life and to earn the  money that I shall require to support me and entertain my friends; and  that sounds about as selfish as anything possibly could.
 It seems to  be mostly 'me' and 'mine,' and it's not the real truth concerning this  house.
 I don't believe there is a healthy, normal man living who has not  his dream.
 I have no hesitation whatever in admitting that I have mine.
  This house must be two things.
 It has got to be a concrete workshop for  me, and it has got to be an abstract abiding place for a dream.
 It's  rather difficult to build a dream house for a dream lady, so I don't  know what kind of a fist I am going to make of it.
"    Linda sat down on a boulder and contemplated her shoes for a minute.
  Then she raised her ever-shifting, eager, young eyes to Peter, and it  seemed to him as he looked into them that there were little gold lights  flickering at the bottom of their darkness.
    "Why, that's just as easy," she said.
 "A home is merely a home.
 It  includes a front porch and a back porch and a fireplace and a bathtub  and an ice chest and a view and a garden around it; all the rest is  incidental.
 If you have more money, you have more incidentals.
 If you  don't have so much, you use your imagination and think you have just as  much on less.
"    "Now, I wonder," said Peter, "when I find my dream lady, if she will  have an elastic imagination.
"    "Haven't you found her yet?" asked Linda casually.
    "No," said Peter, "I haven't found her, and unfortunately she hasn't  found me.
 I have had a strenuous time getting my start in life.
 It's  mostly a rush from one point of interest to another, dropping at  any wayside station for refreshment and the use of a writing table.
  Occasionally I have seen a vision that I have wanted to follow, but I  never have had time.
 So far, the lady of this house is even more of a  dream than the house.
"    "Oh, well, don't worry," said Linda comfortingly.
 "The world is full of  the nicest girls.
 When you get ready for a gracious lady I'll find you  one that will have an India-rubber imagination and a great big loving  heart and Indian-hemp apron strings so that half a dozen babies can  swing from them.
"    Morrison turned to Henry Anderson.
    "You hear, Henry?" he said.
 "I'm destined to have a large family.
 You  must curtail your plans for the workroom and make that big room back of  it into a nursery.
"    "Well, what I am going to do," said Henry Anderson, "is to build a place  suitable for your needs.
 If any dream woman comes to it, she will have  to fit herself to her environment.
"    Linda frowned.
    "Now, that isn't a bit nice of you," she said, "and I don't believe  Peter will pay the slightest attention to you.
 He'll let me make you  build a lovely room for the love of his heart, and a great big bright  nursery on the sunny side for his small people.
"    "I never believed," said Henry Anderson, "in counting your chickens  before they are hatched.
 There are a couple of acres around Peter's  house, and he can build an addition as his needs increase.
"    "Messy idea," said Linda promptly.
 "Thing to do, when you build a house,  is to build it the way you want it for the remainder of your life,  so you don't have to tear up the scenery every few years, dragging in  lumber for expansion.
 And I'll tell you another thing.
 If the homemakers  of this country don't get the idea into their heads pretty soon that  they are not going to be able to hold their own with the rest of the  world, with no children, or one child in the family, there's a sad day  of reckoning coming.
 With the records at the patent office open to  the world, you can't claim that the brain of the white man is not  constructive.
 You can look at our records and compare them with those  of countries ages and ages older than we are, which never discovered  the beauties of a Dover egg-beater or a washing machine or a churn or  a railroad or a steamboat or a bridge.
 We are head and shoulders above  other nations in invention, and just as fast as possible, we are falling  behind in the birth rate.
 The red man and the yellow man and the brown  man and the black man can look at our egg-beaters and washing machines  and bridges and big guns, and go home and copy them; and use them while  rearing even bigger families than they have now.
 If every home in Lilac  Valley had at least six sturdy boys and girls growing up in it with the  proper love of country and the proper realization of the white man's  right to supremacy, and if all the world now occupied by white men could  make an equal record, where would be the talk of the yellow peril? There  wouldn't be any yellow peril.
 You see what I mean?"    Linda lifted her frank eyes to Peter Morrison.
    "Yes, young woman," said Peter gravely, "I see what you mean, but this  is the first time I ever heard a high-school kid propound such ideas.
  Where did you get them?"    "Got them in Multiflores Canyon from my father to start with," said  Linda, "but recently I have been thinking, because there is a boy in  high school who is making a great fight for a better scholarship record  than a Jap in his class.
 I brood over it every spare minute, day or  night, and when I say my prayers I implore high Heaven to send him an  idea or to send me one that I can pass on to him, that will help him to  beat that Jap.
"    "I see," said Peter Morrison.
 "We'll have to take time to talk this  over.
 It's barely possible I might be able to suggest something.
"    "You let that kid fight his own battles," said Henry Anderson roughly.
  "He's no proper bug-catcher.
 I feel it in my bones.
"    For the first time, Linda's joy laugh rang over Peter Morrison's  possession.
    "I don't know about that," she said gaily.
 "He's a wide-awake specimen;  he has led his class for four years when the Jap didn't get ahead of  him.
 But, all foolishness aside, take my word for it, Peter, you'll be  sorry if you don't build this house big enough for your dream lady and  for all the little dreams that may spring from her heart.
"    "Nightmares, you mean," said Henry Anderson.
 "I can't imagine a bunch  of kids muddying up this spring and breaking the bushes and using  slingshots on the birds.
"    "Yes," said Linda with scathing sarcasm, "and wouldn't our government be  tickled to death to have a clear spring and a perfect bush and a singing  bird, if it needed six men to go over the top to handle a regiment of  Japanese!"    Then Peter Morrison laughed.
    "Well, your estimate is too low, Linda," he said in his nicest drawling  tone of voice.
 "Believe me, one U.
 S.
 kid will never march in a whole  regiment of Japanese.
 They won't lay down their guns and walk to  surrender as bunches of Germans did.
 Nobody need ever think that.
 They  are as good fighters as they are imitators.
 There's nothing for you to  do, Henry, but to take to heart what Miss Linda has said.
 Plan the house  with a suite for a dream lady, and a dining room, a sleeping porch and a  nursery big enough for the six children allotted to me.
"    "You're not really in earnest?" asked Henry Anderson in doubting  astonishment.
    "I am in the deepest kind of earnest," said Peter Morrison.
 "What Miss  Linda says is true.
 As a nation, our people are pampering themselves and  living for their own pleasures.
 They won't take the trouble or endure  the pain required to bear and to rear children; and the day is rolling  toward us, with every turn of the planet one day closer, when we are  going to be outnumbered by a combination of peoples who can take our own  tricks and beat us with them.
 We must pass along the good word that the  one thing America needs above every other thing on earth is HOMES AND  HEARTS BIG ENOUGH FOR CHILDREN, as were the homes of our grandfathers,  when no joy in life equaled the joy of a new child in the family, and if  you didn't have a dozen you weren't doing your manifest duty.
"    "Well, if that is the way you see the light, we must enlarge this house.
  As designed, it included every feminine convenience anyway.
 But when I  build my house I am going to build it for myself.
"    "Then don't talk any more about being my bug-catcher," said Linda  promptly, "because when I build my house it's going to be a nest that  will hold six at the very least.
 My heart is perfectly set on a brood of  six.
"    Linda was quite unaware that the two men were studying her closely, but  if she had known what was going on in their minds she would have had  nothing to regret, because both of them found her very attractive, and  both of them were wondering how anything so superficial as Eileen could  be of the same blood as Linda.
    "Are we keeping you too late?" inquired Peter.
    "No," said Linda, "I am as interested as I can be.
 Finish everything you  want to do before we go.
 I hope you're going to let me come over often  and watch you with your building.
 Maybe I can get an idea for some  things I want to do.
 Eileen and I have our house divided by a Mason and  Dixon line.
 On her side is Mother's suite, the dining room, the living  room and the front door.
 On mine there's the garage and the kitchen and  Katy's bedroom and mine and the library and the billiard room.
 At  the present minute I am interested in adapting the library to my  requirements instead of Father's, and I am emptying the billiard room  and furnishing it to make a workroom.
 I have a small talent with a brush  and pencil, and I need some bare walls to tack my prints on to dry, and  I need numerous places for all the things I am always dragging in from  the desert and the canyons; and since I have the Bear Cat running,  what I have been doing in that line with a knapsack won't be worthy of  mention.
"    "How did it come," inquired Henry Anderson, "that you had that car  jacked up so long?"    "Why, hasn't anybody told you," asked Linda, "about our day of the Black  Shadow?"    "John Gilman wrote me when it happened," said Peter softly, "but I don't  believe it has been mentioned before Henry.
 You tell him.
"    Linda turned to Henry Anderson, and with trembling lips and paling  cheeks, in a few brief sentences she gave him the details.
 Then she  said to Peter Morrison in a low voice: "And that is the why of Marian  Thorne's white head.
 Anybody tell you that?"    "That white head puzzled me beyond anything I ever saw," he said.
 "I  meant to ask John about it.
 He used to talk to me and write to me often  about her, and lately he hasn't; when I came I saw the reason, and so  you see I felt reticent on the subject.
"    "Well, there's nothing the matter with my tongue," said Linda.
 "It's  loose at both ends.
 Marian was an expert driver.
 She drove with the same  calm judgment and precision and graceful skill that she does everything  else, but the curve was steep and something in the brakes was defective.
  It broke with a snap and there was not a thing she could do.
 Enough was  left of the remains of the car to prove that.
 Ten days afterward her  head was almost as white as snow.
 Before that it was as dark as mine.
  But her body is just as young and her heart is just as young and her  face is even more beautiful.
 I do think that a white crown makes her  lovelier than she was before.
 I have known Marian ever since I can  remember, and I don't know one thing about her that I could not look you  straight in the eye and tell you all about.
 There is not a subterfuge  or an evasion or a small mean deceit in her soul.
 She is the brainiest  woman and the biggest woman I know.
"    "I haven't a doubt of it," said Peter Morrison.
 "And while you are  talking about nice women, we met a mighty fine one at Riverside on  Sunday.
 Her name is Mary Louise Whiting.
 Do you know her?"    "Not personally," said Linda.
 "I don't recall that I ever saw her.
 I  know her brother, Donald.
 He is the high-school boy who is having the  wrestle with the Jap.
"    "I liked her too," said Henry Anderson.
 "And by the way, Miss Linda,  haven't bug-catchers any reputation at all as nest builders? Is it true  that among feathered creatures the hen builds the home?"    "No, it's not," said Linda promptly.
 "Male birds make a splendid record  carrying nest material.
 What is true is that in the majority of cases  the female does the building.
"    "Well, what I am getting at," said Henry Anderson, "is this.
 Is there  anything I can do to help you with that billiard room that you're going  to convert to a workroom? What do you lack in it that you would like to  have? Do you need more light or air, or a fireplace, or what? When you  take us to the station, suppose you drive us past your house and give  me a look at that room and let me think over it a day or two.
 I might be  able to make some suggestion that would help you.
"    "Now that is positively sweet of you," said Linda.
 "I never thought of  such a thing as either comfort or convenience.
 I thought I had to take  that room as it stands and do the best I could with it, but since you  mention it, it's barely possible that more air might be agreeable and  also more light, and if there could be a small fireplace built in front  of the chimney where it goes up from the library fireplace, it certainly  would be a comfort, and it would add something to the room that nothing  else could.
    "No workroom really has a soul if you can't smell smoke and see red when  you go to it at night.
"    "You little outdoor heathen," laughed Peter Morrison.
 "One would think  you were an Indian.
"    "I am a fairly good Indian," said Linda.
 "I have been scouting around  with my father a good many years.
 How about it, Peter? Does the road go  crooked?"    "Yes," said Peter, "the road goes crooked.
"    "Does the bed of the spring curve and sweep across the lawn and drop off  to the original stream below the tree-tobacco clump there?"    "If you say so, it does," said Peter.
    "Including the bridge?" inquired Linda.
    "Including the bridge," said Peter.
 "I'll have to burn some midnight  oil, but I can visualize the bridge.
"    "And is this house where you 'set up your rest,' as you so beautifully  said the other night at dinner, going to lay its corner stone and grow  to its roof a selfish house, or is it going to be generous enough for a  gracious lady and a flight of little footsteps?"    Peter Morrison took off his hat.
 He turned his face toward the length of  Lilac Valley and stood, very tall and straight, looking far away before  him.
 Presently he looked down at Linda.
    "Even so," he said softly.
 "My shoulders are broad enough; I have a  brain; and I am not afraid to work.
 If my heart is not quite big enough  yet, I see very clearly how it can be made to expand.
"    "I have been told," said Linda in a low voice, "that Mary Louise Whiting  is a perfect darling.
"    Peter looked at her from the top of her black head to the tips of her  brown shoes.
 He could have counted the freckles bridging her nose.
 The  sunburn on her cheeks was very visible; there was something arresting in  the depth of her eyes, the curve of her lips, the lithe slenderness of  her young body; she gave the effect of something smoldering inside that  would leap at a breath.
    "I was not thinking of Miss Whiting," he said soberly.
    Henry Anderson was watching.
 Now he turned his back and commenced  talking about plans, but in his heart he said: "So that's the lay of the  land.
 You've got to hustle yourself, Henry, or you won't have the ghost  of a show.
"    Later, when they motored down the valley and stopped at the Strong  residence, Peter refused to be monopolized by Eileen.
 He climbed the two  flights of stairs with Henry Anderson and Linda and exhausted his fund  of suggestions as to what could be done to that empty billiard room  to make an attractive study of it.
 Linda listened quietly to all their  suggestions, and then she said:    "It would be fine to have another window, and a small skylight would be  a dream, and as for the fireplace you mention, I can't even conceive how  great it would be to have that; but my purse is much more limited than  Peter's, and while I have my school work to do every day, my earning  capacity is nearly negligible.
 I can only pick up a bit here and there  with my brush and pencil--place cards and Easter cards and valentines,  and once or twice magazine covers, and little things like that.
 I don't  see my way clear to lumber and glass and bricks and chimney pieces.
"    Peter looked at Henry, and Henry looked at Peter, and a male high sign,  ancient as day, passed between them.
    "Easiest thing in the world," said Peter.
 "It's as sure as shooting that  when my three or four fireplaces, which Henry's present plans call for,  are built, there is going to be all the material left that can be used  in a light tiny fireplace such as could be built on a third floor, and  when the figuring for the house is done it could very easily include the  cutting of a skylight and an extra window or two here, and getting the  material in with my stuff, it would cost you almost nothing.
"    Linda's eyes opened wide and dewy with surprise and pleasure.
    "Why, you two perfectly nice men!" she said.
 "I haven't felt as I do  this minute since I lost Daddy.
 It's wonderful to be taken care of.
 It's  better than cream puffs with almond flavoring.
"    Henry Anderson looked at Linda keenly.
    "You're the darndest kid!" he said.
 "One minute you're smacking your  lips over cream puffs, and the next you're going to the bottom of the  yellow peril.
 I never before saw your combination in one girl.
 What's  the explanation?" For the second time that evening Linda's specialty in  rapture floated free.
    "Bunch all the component parts into the one paramount fact that I am  Saturday's child," she said, "so I am constantly on the job of working  for a living, and then add to that the fact that I was reared by a nerve  specialist.
"    Then they went downstairs, and the men refused both Eileen's and Linda's  invitation to remain for dinner.
 When they had gone Eileen turned to  Linda with a discontented and aggrieved face.
    "In the name of all that's holy, what are you doing or planning to do?"  she demanded.
    "Not anything that will cost you a penny beyond my natural rights," said  Linda quietly.
    "That is not answering my question," said Eileen.
 "You're not of age and  you're still under the authority of a guardian.
 If you can't answer me,  possibly you can him.
 Shall I send John Gilman to ask what I want to  know of you?"    "When did I ever ask you any questions about what you chose to do?"  asked Linda.
 "I am merely following the example that you have previously  set me.
 John Gilman and I used to be great friends.
 It might help both  of us to have a family reunion.
 Send him by all means.
"    "You used to take pride," suggested Eileen, "in leading your class.
"    "And has anyone told you that I am not leading my class at the present  minute?" asked Linda.
    "No," said Eileen, "but what I want to point out to you is that the  minute you start running with the boys you will quit leading your  class.
"    "Don't you believe it," said Linda quietly.
 "I'm not built that way.
  I shan't concentrate on any boy to the exclusion of chemistry and  geometry, never fear it.
"    Then she thoughtfully ascended the stairs and went to work.
    Eileen went to her room and sat down to think; and the more she thought,  the deeper grew her anger and chagrin; and to the indifference that  always had existed in her heart concerning Linda was added in that  moment a new element.
 She was jealous of her.
 How did it come that a  lanky, gangling kid in her tees had been paid a visit by the son of  possibly the most cultured and influential family of the city, people of  prestige, comfortable wealth, and unlimited popularity? For four years  she had struggled to gain an entrance in some way into Louise Whiting's  intimate circle of friends, and she had ended by shutting the door on  the only son of the family.
 And why had she ever allowed Linda to keep  the runabout? It was not proper that a young girl should own a high  powered car like that.
 It was not proper that she should drive it and go  racing around the country, heaven knew where, and with heaven knew whom.
  Eileen bit her lip until it almost bled.
 Her eyes were hateful and her  hands were nervous as she reviewed the past week.
 She might think any  mean thing that a mean brain could conjure up, but when she calmed down  to facts she had to admit that there was not a reason in the world why  Linda should not drive the car she had driven for her father, or why  she should not take with her Donald Whiting or Peter Morrison or Henry  Anderson.
 The thing that rankled was that the car belonged to Linda.
 The  touring car which she might have owned and driven, had she so desired,  lay in an extremely slender string of pearls around her neck at that  instant.
 She reflected that if she had kept her car and made herself  sufficiently hardy to drive it, she might have been the one to  have taken Peter Morrison to his home location and to have had many  opportunities for being with him.
    "I've been a fool," said Eileen, tugging at the pearls viciously.
 "They  are nothing but a little bit of a string that looks as if I were trying  to do something and couldn't, at best.
 What I've got to do is to think  more of myself.
 I've got to plan some way to prevent Linda from being  too popular until I really get my mind made up as to what I want to do.
"        .
 Leavening the Bread of Life    "'A house that is divided against itself cannot stand,'" quoted Linda.
  "I must keep in mind what Eileen said, not that there is the slightest  danger, but to fall behind in my grades is a thing that simply must not  happen.
 If it be true that Peter and Henry can so easily and so cheaply  add a few improvements in my workroom in connection with Peter's  building, I can see no reason why they shouldn't do it, so long as I pay  for it.
 I haven't a doubt but that there will be something I can do  for Peter, before he finishes his building, that he would greatly  appreciate, while, since I'm handy with my pencil, I MIGHT be able to  make a few head and tail pieces for some of his articles that would make  them more attractive.
 I don't want to use any friend of mine: I don't  want to feel that I am not giving quite as much as I get, but I think I  see my way clear, between me and the Bear Cat, to pay for all the favors  I would receive in altering my study.
    "First thing I do I must go through Father's books and get the money for  them, so I'll know my limitation when I come to select furniture.
 And  I don't know that I am going to be so terribly modest when it comes to  naming the sum with which I'll be satisfied for my allowance.
 Possibly I  shall exercise my age-old prerogative and change my mind; I may just say  'half' right out loud and stick to it.
 And there's another thing.
 Since  the editor of Everybody's Home has started my department and promised  that if it goes well he will give it to me permanently, I can certainly  depend on something from that.
 He has used my Introduction and two  instalments now.
 I should think it might be fair to talk payments pretty  soon.
 He should give me fifty dollars for a recipe with its perfectly  good natural history and embellished with my own vegetable and floral  decorations.
    "In the meantime I think I might buy my worktable and possibly an easel,  so I can have real room to spread out my new material and see how it  would feel to do one drawing completely unhampered.
 I'll order the table  tonight, and then I'll begin on the books, because I must have Saturday  free; and I must be thinking about the most attractive and interesting  place I can take Donald to.
 I just have to keep him interested until  he gets going of his own accord, because he shall beat Oka Sayye.
 I  wouldn't let Donald say it but I don't mind saying myself to myself  with no one present except myself that in all my life I have never seen  anything so masklike as the stolid little square head on that Jap.
 I  have never seen anything I dislike more than the oily, stiff, black  hair standing up on it like menacing bristles.
 I have never had but one  straight look deep into his eyes, but in that look I saw the only thing  that ever frightened me in looking into a man's eyes in my whole life.
  And there is one thing that I have to remember to caution Donald about.
  He must carry on this contest in a perfectly open, fair, and aboveboard  way, and he simply must not antagonize Oka Sayye.
 There are so many of  the Japs.
 They all look so much alike, and there's a blood brotherhood  between them that will make them protect each other to the death against  any white man.
 It wouldn't be safe for Donald to make Oka Sayye hate  him.
 He had far better try to make him his friend and put a spirit of  honest rivalry into his heart; but come to think of it, there wasn't  anything like that in my one look into Oka Sayye's eyes.
 I don't know  what it was, but whatever it was it was something repulsive.
"    With this thought in her mind Linda walked slowly as she approached  the high school the next time.
 Far down the street, over the walks and  across the grounds, her eyes were searching eagerly for the tall slender  figure of Donald Whiting.
 She did not see him in the morning, but at  noon she encountered him in the hall.
    "Looking for you," he cried gaily when he saw her.
 "I've got my pry in  on Trig.
 The professor's interested.
 Dad fished out an old Trig that  he used when he was a boy and I have some new angles that will keep my  esteemed rival stirring up his gray matter for some little time.
"    "Good for you! Joyous congratulations! You've got the idea!" cried  Linda.
 "Go to it! Start something all along the line, but make it  something founded on brains and reason and common sense.
 But, Donald, I  was watching for you.
 I wanted to say a word.
"    Donald Whiting bent toward her.
 The faintest suspicion of a tinge of  color crept into his cheeks.
    "That's fine," he said.
 "What was it you wanted?"    "Only this," she said in almost a breathless whisper.
 "There is nothing  in California I am afraid of except a Jap, and I am afraid of them, not  potentially, not on account of what all of us know they are planning  in the backs of their heads for the future, but right here and now,  personally and physically.
 Don't antagonize Oka Sayye.
 Don't be too  precipitate about what you're trying to do.
 Try to make it appear that  you're developing ideas for the interest and edification of the whole  class.
 Don't incur his personal enmity.
 Use tact.
"    "You think I am afraid of that little jiu-jitsu?" he scoffed.
 "I can  lick him with one hand.
"    "I haven't a doubt of it," said Linda, measuring his height and apparent  strength and fitness.
 "I haven't a doubt of it.
 But let me ask you this  confidentially: Have you got a friend who would slip in and stab him in  the back in case you were in an encounter and he was getting the better  of you?"    Donald Whiting's eyes widened.
 He looked at Linda amazed.
    "Wouldn't that be going rather far?" he asked.
 "I think I have some  fairly good friends among the fellows, but I don't know just whom I  would want to ask to do me that small favor.
"    "That is precisely the point," cried Linda.
 "You haven't a friend you  would ask; and you haven't a friend who would do it, if you did.
 But  don't believe for one second that Oka Sayye hasn't half a dozen who  would make away with you at an unexpected time and in a secluded place,  and vanish, if it would in any way further Oka Sayye's ambition, or help  establish the supremacy of the Japanese in California.
"    "Um-hm," said Donald Whiting.
    He was looking far past Linda and now his eyes were narrowed in thought.
  "I believe you're RIGHT about it.
"    "I've thought of you so often since I tried to spur you to beat Oka  Sayye," said Linda.
 "I feel a sort of responsibility for you.
 It's to  the honor and glory of all California, and the United States, and the  white race everywhere for you to beat him, but if any harm should come  to you I would always feel that I shouldn't have urged it.
"    "Now that's foolishness," said Donald earnestly.
 "If I am such a dub  that I didn't have the ambition to think up some way to beat a Jap  myself, no matter what happens you shouldn't regret having been the one  to point out to me my manifest duty.
 Dad is a Harvard man, you know, and  that is where he's going to send me, and in talking about it the other  night I told him about you, and what you had said to me.
 He's the  greatest old scout, and was mightily interested.
 He went at once and  opened a box of books in the garret and dug out some stuff that will be  a big help to me.
 He's going to keep posted and see what he can do; he  said even worse things to me than you did; so you needn't feel that you  have any responsibility; besides that, it's not proved yet that I can  beat Oka Sayye.
"    "Yes, it is!" said Linda, sending a straight level gaze deep into his  eyes.
 "Yes, it is! Whenever a white man makes up his mind what he's  going to do, and puts his brain to work, he beats any man, of any other  color.
 Sure you're going to beat him.
"    "Fat chance I have not to," said Donald, laughing ruefully.
 "If I don't  beat him I am disgraced at home, and with you; before I try very long in  this highly specialized effort I am making, every professor in the high  school and every member of my class is bound to become aware of what  is going on.
 You're mighty right about it.
 I have got to beat him or  disgrace myself right at the beginning of my nice young career.
"    "Of course you'll beat him," said Linda.
    "At what hour did you say I should come, Saturday?"    "Oh, come with the lark for all I care," said Linda.
 "Early morning in  the desert is a mystery and a miracle, and the larks have been there  just long enough to get their voices properly tuned for their purest  notes.
"    Then she turned and hurried away.
 Her first leisure minute after  reaching home she went to the library wearing one of Katy's big aprons,  and carrying a brush and duster.
 Beginning at one end of each shelf, she  took down the volumes she intended to sell, carefully dusted them, wiped  their covers, and the place on which they had stood, and then opened and  leafed through them so that no scrap of paper containing any notes or  memoranda of possible value should be overlooked.
 It was while handling  these volumes that Linda shifted several of the books written by her  father, to separate them from those with which she meant to part.
 She  had grown so accustomed to opening each book she handled and looking  through it, that she mechanically opened the first one she picked up and  from among its leaves there fell a scrap of loose paper.
 She picked it  up and found it was a letter from the publishers of the book.
 Linda's  eyes widened suddenly as she read:    MY DEAR STRONG:    Sending you a line of congratulations.
 You have gone to the head of the  list of "best sellers" among medical works, and the cheque I draw you  for the past six months' royalties will be considerably larger than that  which goes to your most esteemed contemporary on your chosen subject.
    Very truly yours,    The signature was that of Frederic Dickman, the editor of one of the  biggest publishing houses of the country.
    "Hm," she said to herself softly.
 "Now that is a queer thing.
 That  letter was written nearly five years ago.
 I don't know why I never  thought of royalties since Daddy went.
 I frequently heard him  mention them before.
 I suppose they're being paid to John Gilman as  administrator, or to the Consolidated Bank, and cared for with Father's  other business.
 There's no reason why these books should not keep on  selling.
 There are probably the same number of young men, if not a  greater number, studying medicine every year.
 I wonder now, about these  royalties.
 I must do some thinking.
"    Then Linda began to examine books more carefully than before.
 The letter  she carried with her when she went to her room; but she made a point of  being on the lawn that evening when John Gilman came, and after talking  to him a few minutes, she said very casually: "John, as Father's  administrator, does a royalty from his medical books come to you?"    "No," said Gilman.
 "It is paid to his bank.
"    "I don't suppose," said Linda casually, "it would amount to enough to  keep one in shoes these inflated days.
"    "Oh, I don't know about that," said John testily.
 "I have seen a few of  those cheques in your Father's time.
 You should be able to keep fairly  well supplied with shoes.
"    "So I should," said Linda drily.
 "So I should.
"    Then she led him to the back of the house and talked the incident out  of his mind as cleverly as possible by giving him an intensive botanical  study of Cotyledon.
 But she could not interest him quite so deeply  as she had hoped, for presently he said: "Eileen tells me that you're  parting with some of the books.
"    "Only technical ones for which I could have no possible use," said  Linda.
 "I need clothes, and have found that had I a proper place to work  in and proper tools to work with, I could earn quite a bit with my brush  and pencil, and so I am trying to get enough money together to fit up  the billiard room for a workroom, since nobody uses it for anything  else.
"    "I see," said John Gilman.
 "I suppose running a house is extremely  expensive these days, but even so the income from your estate should be  sufficient to dress a schoolgirl and provide for anything you would want  in the way of furnishing a workroom.
"    "That's what I have always thought myself," said Linda; "but Eileen  doesn't agree with me, and she handles the money.
 When the first of  the month comes, we are planning to go over things together, and she is  going to make me a proper allowance.
"    "That is exactly as it should be," said Gilman.
 "I never realized till  the other night at dinner that you have grown such a great girl, Linda.
  That's fine! Fix your workroom the way you would like to have it, and  if there's anything I can do to help you in any way, you have only to  command me.
 I haven't seen you often lately.
"    "No," said Linda, "but I don't feel that it is exactly my fault.
 Marian  and I were always pals.
 When I saw that you preferred Eileen, I kept  with Marian to comfort her all I could.
 I don't suppose she cared,  particularly.
 She couldn't have, or she would at least have made some  effort to prevent Eileen from monopolizing you.
 She probably was mighty  glad to be rid of you; but since you had been together so much, I  thought she might miss you, so I tried to cover your defection.
"    John Gilman's face flushed.
 He stood very still, while he seemed deeply  thoughtful.
    "Of course you were free to follow your inclinations, or Eileen's  machinations, whichever you did follow," Linda said lightly, "but 'them  as knows' could tell you, John, as Katy so well puts it, that you have  made the mistake of your young life.
"    Then she turned and went to the garage, leaving John to his visit with  Eileen.
    The Eileen who took possession of John was an Eileen with whom he was  not acquainted.
 He had known, the night of the dinner party, that Eileen  was pouting, but there had been no chance to learn from her what  her grievance was, and by the next time they met she was a bundle of  flashing allurement, so he ignored the occurrence.
 This evening, for the  first time, it seemed to him that Eileen was not so beautiful a woman as  he had thought her.
 Something had roiled the blood in her delicate veins  until it had muddied the clear freshness of her smooth satiny skin.
  There was discontent in her eyes, which were her most convincing  attraction.
 They were big eyes, wide open and candid.
 She had so trained  them through a lifetime of practice that she could meet other eyes  directly while manipulating her most dextrous evasion.
 Whenever Eileen  was most deceptively subtle, she was looking straight at her victim with  the innocent appeal of a baby in her gaze.
    John Gilman had had his struggle.
 He had succeeded.
 He had watched, and  waited, and worked incessantly, and when his opportunity came he was  ready.
 Success had come to such a degree that in a short time he had  assured himself of comfort for any woman he loved.
 He knew that his  appearance was quite as pleasing as that of his friend.
 He knew that  in manner and education they were equals.
 He was now handling large  business affairs.
 He had made friends in high places.
 Whenever Eileen  was ready, he would build and furnish a home he felt sure would be  equal, if not superior, to what Morrison was planning.
 Why had Eileen  felt that she would envy any woman who shared life with Peter Morrison?    All that day she had annoyed him, because there must have been in the  very deeps of his soul "a still, small voice" whispering to him that  he had not lived up to the best traditions of a gentleman in his course  with Marian.
 While no definite plans had been made, there had been  endless assumption.
 Many times they had talked of the home they would  make together.
 When he reached the point where he decided that he never  had loved Marian as a man should love the woman he marries, he felt  justified in turning to Eileen, but in his heart he knew that if he had  been the man he was pleased to consider himself, he would have gone to  Marian Thorne and explained, thereby keeping her friendship, while he  now knew that he must have earned her contempt.
    The day at Riverside had been an enigma he could not solve.
 Eileen was  gay to a degree that was almost boisterous.
 She had attracted attention  and comment which no well-bred woman would have done.
    The growing discontent in John's soul had increased under Linda's direct  attack.
 He had known Linda since she was four years old and had been  responsible for some of her education.
 He had been a large influence  in teaching Linda from childhood to be a good sport, to be sure she was  right and then go ahead, and if she hurt herself in the going, to rub  the bruise, but to keep her path.
    A thing patent to the eye of every man who turned an appraising look  upon Linda always had been one of steadfast loyalty.
 You could depend  upon her.
 She was the counterpart of her father; and Doctor Strong had  been loved by other men.
 Wherever he had gone he had been surrounded.
  His figure had been one that attracted attention.
 When he had spoken,  his voice and what he had to say had commanded respect.
 And then there  had emanated from him that peculiar physical charm which gives such  pleasing and distinguished personality to a very few people in this  world.
 This gift too had descended to Linda.
 She could sit and look  straight at you with her narrow, interested eyes, smile faintly, and  make you realize what she thought and felt without opening her lips.
  John did not feel very well acquainted with the girl who had dominated  the recent dinner party, but he did see that she was attractive, that  both Peter Morrison and Henry Anderson had been greatly amused and very  much entertained by her.
 He had found her so interesting himself that he  had paid slight attention to Eileen's pouting.
    Tonight he was forced to study Eileen, for the sake of his own comfort  to try to conciliate her.
 He was uncomfortable because he was unable  to conduct himself as Eileen wished him to, without a small sickening  disgust creeping into his soul.
 Before the evening was over he became  exasperated, and ended by asking flatly: "Eileen, what in the dickens is  the matter with you?"    It was a new tone and a new question on nerves tensely strung.
    "If you weren't blind you'd know without asking," retorted Eileen hotly.
    "Then I am 'blind,' for I haven't the slightest notion.
 What have I  done?"    "Isn't it just barely possible," asked Eileen, "that there might be  other people who would annoy and exasperate me? I have not hinted that  you have done anything, although I don't know that it's customary for a  man calling on his betrothed to stop first for a visit with her sister.
"    "For the love of Mike!" said John Gilman.
 "Am I to be found fault with  for crossing the lawn a minute to see how Linda's wild garden is coming  on? I have dug and helped set enough of those plants to justify some  interest in them as they grow.
"    "And the garden was your sole subject of conversation?" inquired Eileen,  implied doubt conveyed nicely.
    "No, it was not," answered Gilman, all the bulldog in his nature coming  to the surface.
    "As I knew perfectly," said Eileen.
 "I admit that I'm not feeling  myself.
 Things began going wrong recently, and everything has gone wrong  since.
 I think it all began with Marian Thorne's crazy idea of selling  her home and going to the city to try to ape a man.
"    "Marian never tried to ape a man in her life," said John, instantly  yielding to a sense of justice.
 "She is as strictly feminine as any  woman I ever knew.
"    "Do you mean to say that you think studying architecture is a woman's  work?" sneered Eileen.
    "Yes, I do," said Gilman emphatically.
 "Women live in houses.
 They're  in them nine tenths of the time to a man's one tenth.
 Next to rocking  a cradle I don't know of any occupation in this world more distinctly  feminine than the planning of comfortable homes for homekeeping people.
"    Eileen changed the subject swiftly.
 "What was Linda saying to you?" she  asked.
    "She was showing me a plant, a rare Echeveria of the Cotyledon family,  that she tobogganed down one side of Multiflores Canyon and delivered  safely on the roadway without its losing an appreciable amount of  'bloom' from its exquisitely painted leaves.
"    Eileen broke in rudely.
 "Linda has missed Marian.
 There's not a possible  thing to make life uncomfortable for me that she is not doing.
 You  needn't tell me you didn't see and understand her rude forwardness the  other night!"    "No, I didn't see it," said John, "because the fact is I thought the kid  was positively charming, and so did Peter and Henry because both of them  said so.
 There's one thing you must take into consideration, Eileen.
 The  time has come when she should have clothes and liberty and opportunity  to shape her life according to her inclinations.
 Let me tell you she  will attract attention in georgette and laces.
"    "And where are the georgette and laces to come from?" inquired Eileen  sarcastically.
 "All outgo and no income for four years is leaving the  Strong finances in mighty precarious shape, I can tell you.
"    "All right," said Gilman, "I'm financially comfortable now.
 I'm ready.
  Say the word.
 We'll select our location and build our home, and let  Linda have what there is of the Strong income till she is settled in  life.
 You have pretty well had all of it for the past four years.
"    "Yes," said Eileen furiously, "I have 'pretty well' had it, in a few  little dresses that I have altered myself and very frequently made  entirely.
 I have done the best I could, shifting and skimping, and it's  not accomplished anything that I have really wanted.
 According to men,  the gas and the telephone and the electric light and the taxes and  food and cook pay for themselves.
 All a woman ever spends money on is  clothes!"    "Eileen," chuckled John Gilman, "this sounds exactly as if we were  married, and we're not, yet.
"    "No," said Eileen, "thank heaven we're not.
 If it's come to the place  where you're siding with everybody else against me, and where you're  more interested in what my kid sister has to say to you than you are in  me, I don't think we ever shall be.
"    Then, from stress of nerve tension and long practice, some big tears  gushed up and threatened to overflow Eileen's lovely eyes.
 That never  should happen, for tears are salt water and they cut little rivers  through even the most carefully and skillfully constructed complexion,  while Eileen's was looking its worst that evening.
 She hastily applied  her handkerchief, and John Gilman took her into his arms; so the  remainder of the evening it was as if they were not married.
 But when  John returned to the subject of a home and begged Eileen to announce  their engagement and let him begin work, she evaded him, and put him  off, and had to have time to think, and she was not ready, and there  were many excuses, for none of which Gilman could see any sufficient  reason.
 When he left Eileen that night, it was with a heavy heart.
        .
 Saturday's Child    Throughout the week Linda had worked as never during her life  previously, in order to save Saturday for Donald Whiting.
 She ran the  Bear Cat down to the garage and had it looked over once more to be sure  that everything was all right.
 Friday evening, on her way from school,  she stopped at a grocery where she knew Eileen kept an account, and for  the first time ordered a few groceries.
 These she carried home with her,  and explained to Katy what she wanted.
    Katy fully realized that Linda was still her child, with no thought in  her mind save standing at the head of her classes, carrying on the work  she had begun with her father, keeping up her nature study, and getting  the best time she could out of life in the open as she had been taught  to do from her cradle.
    Katy had not the slightest intention of opening her lips to say one word  that might put any idea into the head of her beloved child, but she saw  no reason why she herself should not harbor all the ideas she pleased.
    Whereupon, actuated by a combination of family pride, love, ambition in  her chosen profession, Katy made ready to see that on the morrow the  son of Frederick Whiting should be properly nourished on his outing with  Linda.
    At six o'clock Saturday morning Linda ran the Bear Cat to the back door,  where she and Katy packed it.
 Before they had finished, Donald Whiting  came down the sidewalk, his cheeks flushed with the exercise of walking,  his eyes bright with anticipation, his cause forever won--in case he had  a cause--with Katy, because she liked the wholesome, hearty manner in  which he greeted Linda, and she was dumbfounded when he held out his  hand to her and said laughingly: "Blessed among women, did you put in a  fine large consignment of orange punch?"    "No," said Katy, "I'll just tell ye flat-footed there ain't going to be  any punch, but, young sir, you're eshcortin' a very capable young lady,  and don't ye bewail the punch, because ye might be complimenting your  face with something ye would like a hape better.
"    "Can't be done, Katy," cried Donald.
    "Ye must have a poor opinion of us," laughed Katy, "if ye are thinking  ye can get to the end of our limitations in one lunch.
 Fourteen years me  and Miss Linda's been on this lunch-box stunt.
 Don't ye be thinkin' ye  can exhaust us in any wan trip, or in any wan dozen.
"    So they said good-bye to Katy and rolled past Eileen's room on the way  to the desert.
 Eileen stood at the window watching them, and never had  her heart been so full of discontent and her soul the abiding place of  such envy or her mind so busy.
 Just when she had thought life was going  to yield her what she craved, she could not understand how or why things  should begin to go wrong.
    As the Bear Cat traversed Lilac Valley, Linda was pointing out Peter  Morrison's location.
 She was telling Donald Whiting where to find  Peter's articles, and what a fine man he was, and that he had promised  to think how he could help with their plan to make of Donald a better  scholar than was Oka Sayye.
    "Well, I call that mighty decent of a stranger," said Donald.
    "But he is scarcely more of a stranger than I am," answered Linda.
 "He  is a writer.
 He is interested in humanity.
 It's the business of every  man in this world to reach out and help every boy with whom he comes in  contact into the biggest, finest manhood possible.
 He only knows that  you're a boy tackling a big job that means much to every white boy to  have you succeed with, and for that reason he's just as interested as I  am.
 Maybe, when we come in this evening, I'll run up to his place, and  you can talk it over with him.
 If your father helped you at one angle,  it's altogether probable that Peter Morrison could help you at another.
"    Donald Whiting rubbed his knee reflectively.
 He was sitting half turned  in the wide seat so that he might watch Linda's hands and her face while  she drove.
    "Well, that's all right," he said heartily.
 "You can write me down as  willing and anxious to take all the help I can get, for it's going to be  no microscopic job, that I can tell you.
 One week has waked up the Jap  to the fact that there's something doing, and he's digging in and has  begun, the last day or two, to speak up in class and suggest things  himself.
 Since I've been studying him and watching him, I have come to  the conclusion that he is much older than I am.
 Something he said in  class yesterday made me think he had probably had the best schooling  Japan could give him before he came here.
 The next time you meet him  look for a suspicion of gray hairs around his ears.
 He's too blamed  comprehensive for the average boy of my age.
 You said the Japs were the  best imitators in the world and I have an idea in the back of my head  that before I get through with him, Oka Sayye is going to prove your  proposition.
"    Linda nodded as she shot the Bear Cat across the streetcar tracks and  headed toward the desert.
 The engine was purring softly as it warmed up.
  The car was running smoothly.
 The sun of early morning was shining on  them through bracing, salt, cool air, and even in the valley the larks  were busy, and the mockingbirds, and from every wayside bush the rosy  finches were singing.
 All the world was coming to the exquisite bloom of  a half-tropical country.
 Up from earth swept the heavy odors of blooming  citrus orchards, millions of roses, and the overpowering sweetness of  gardens and cultivated flowers; while down from the mountains rolled the  delicate breath of the misty blue lilac, the pungent odor of California  sage, and the spicy sweet of the lemonade bush.
 They were two young  things, free for the day, flying down a perfect road, adventuring with  Providence.
 They had only gone a few miles when Donald Whiting took off  his hat, stuffed it down beside him, and threw back his head, shaking  his hair to the wind in a gesture so soon to become familiar to Linda.
  She glanced across at him and found him looking at her.
 A smile broke  over her lips.
 One of her most spontaneous laughs bubbled up in her  throat.
    "Topping, isn't it!" she cried gaily.
    "It's the best thing that ever happened to me," answered Donald Whiting  instantly.
 "Our car is a mighty good one and Dad isn't mean about  letting me drive it.
 I can take it frequently and can have plenty of  gas and take my crowd; but lordy, I don't believe there's a boy or girl  living that doesn't just positively groan when they see one of these  little gray Bear Cats go loping past.
 And I never even had a ride in one  before.
 I can't get over the fact that it's yours.
 It wouldn't seem so  funny if it belonged to one of the fellows.
"    With steady hand and gradually increasing speed, Linda put the Bear Cat  over the roads of early morning.
 Sometimes she stopped in the shade of  pepper, eucalyptus, or palm, where the larks were specializing in their  age-old offertory.
 And then again they went racing until they reached  the real desert.
 Linda ran the car under the shade of a tall clump of  bloom-whitened alders.
 She took off her hat, loosened the hair at her  temples, and looked out across the long morning stretch of desert.
    "It's just beginning to be good," she said.
 She began pointing with  her slender hand.
 "That gleam you see over there is the gold of a  small clump of early poppies.
 The purple beyond it is lupin.
 All these  exquisite colors on the floor are birds'-eyes and baby blue eyes, and  the misty white here and there is forget-me-not.
 It won't be long til  thousands and thousands of yucca plants will light their torches all  over the desert and all the alders show their lacy mist.
 Of course you  know how exquisitely the Spaniards named the yucca 'Our Lord's Candles.
'  Isn't that the prettiest name for a flower, and isn't it the prettiest  thought?"    "It certainly is," answered Donald.
    "Had any experience with the desert?" Linda asked lightly.
    "Hunted sage hens some," answered Donald.
    "Oh, well, that'll be all right," said Linda.
 "I wondered if you'd go  murdering yourself like a tenderfoot.
"    "What's the use of all this artillery?" inquired Donald as he stepped  from the car.
    "Better put on your hat.
 You're taller than most of the bushes; you'll  find slight shade," cautioned Linda.
 "The use is purely a matter  of self-protection.
 The desert has got such a devil of a fight for  existence, without shade and practically without water, that it can't  afford to take any other chance of extermination, and so it protects  itself with needles here and spears there and sabers at other places and  roots that strike down to China everywhere.
 First thing we are going to  get is some soap.
"    "Great hat!" exclaimed Donald.
 "If you wanted soap why didn't you bring  some?"    "For all you know," laughed Linda, "I may be going to education you up a  little.
 Dare you to tell me how many kinds of soap I can find today that  the Indians used, and where I can find it.
"    "Couldn't tell you one to save my life," said Donald.
    "And born and reared within a few miles of the desert!" scoffed Linda.
  "Nice Indian you'd make.
 We take our choice today between finding  deer-brush and digging for amole, because the mock oranges aren't ripe  enough to be nice and soapy yet.
 I've got the deer-brush spotted, and  we'll pass an amole before we go very far.
 Look for a wavy blue-green  leaf like a wide blade of grass and coming up like a lily.
"    So together they went to the deer-brush and gathered a bunch of flowers  that Linda bound together with some wiry desert grass and fastened to  her belt.
 It was not long before Donald spied an amole, and having found  one, discovered many others growing near.
 Then Linda led the way past  thorns and brush, past impenetrable beds of cholla, until they reached  a huge barrel cactus that she had located with the glasses.
 Beside this  bristling monstrous growth Linda paused, and reached for the axe, which  Donald handed to her.
 She drew it lightly across the armor protecting  the plant.
    "Short of Victrola needles?" she inquired.
 "Because if you are, these  make excellent ones.
 A lot more singing quality to them than the steel  needles, not nearly so metallic.
"    "Well, I am surely going to try that," said Donald.
 "Never heard of such  a thing.
"    Linda chopped off a section of plant.
 Then she picked one of the knives  from the bucket and handed it to him.
    "All right, you get what you want," she said, "while I operate on the  barrel.
"    She set her feet firmly in the sand, swung the axe, and with a couple of  deft strokes sliced off the top of the huge plant, and from the heart of  it lifted up half a bucketful of the juicy interior, with her dipper.
    "If we didn't have drink, here is where we would get it, and mighty good  it is," she said, pushing down with the dipper until she formed a small  pool in the heart of the plant which rapidly filled.
 "Have a taste.
"    "Jove, that is good!" said Donald.
 "What are you going to do with it?"    "Show you later," laughed Linda.
 "Think I'll take a sip myself.
"    Then by a roundabout route they started on their return to the car.
 Once  Linda stopped and gathered a small bunch of an extremely curious little  plant spreading over the ground, a tiny reddish vine with quaint round  leaves that looked as if a drop of white paint rimmed with maroon had  fallen on each of them.
    "I never saw that before," said Donald.
 "What are you going to do with  it?"    "Use it on whichever of us gets the first snake bite," said Linda.
 "That  is rattlesnake weed and if a poisonous snake bites you, score each side  of the wound with the cleanest, sharpest knife you have and then bruise  the plant and bind it on with your handkerchief, and forget it.
"    "Is that what you do?" inquired Donald.
    "Why sure," said Linda, "that is what I would do if a snake were so  ungallant as to bite me, but there doesn't seem to be much of the  antagonistic element in my nature.
 I don't go through the desert  exhaling the odor of fright, and so snakes lie quiescent or slip away so  silently that I never see them.
"    "Now what on earth do you mean by that?" inquired Donald.
    "Why that is the very first lesson Daddy ever taught me when he took me  to the mountains and the desert.
 If you are afraid, your system throws  off formic acid, and the animals need only the suspicion of a scent of  it to make them ready to fight.
 Any animal you encounter or even a bee,  recognizes it.
 One of the first things that I remember about Daddy was  seeing him sit on the running board of the runabout buckling up his  desert boots while he sang to me,      'Let not your heart be troubled    Neither let it be afraid,'    as he got ready to take me on his back and go into the desert for our  first lesson; he told me that a man was perfectly safe in going to the  forest or the desert or anywhere he chose among any kind of animals if  he had sufficient self-control that no odor of fear emanated from him.
  He said that a man was safe to make his way anywhere he wanted to go, if  he started his journey by recognizing a blood brotherhood with anything  living he would meet on the way; and I have heard Enos Mills say that  when he was snow inspector of Colorado he traveled the crest of the  Rockies from one end of the state to the other without a gun or any  means of self-defense.
"    "Now, that is something new to think about," said Donald.
    "And it's something that is very true," said Linda.
 "I have seen it  work times without number.
 Father and I went quietly up the mountains,  through the canyons, across the desert, and we would never see a snake  of any kind, but repeatedly we would see men with guns and dogs out to  kill, to trespass on the rights of the wild, and they would be hunting  for sticks and clubs and firing their guns where we had passed never  thinking of lurking danger.
 If you start out in accord, at one with  Nature, you're quite as safe as you are at home, sometimes more so.
 But  if you start out to stir up a fight, the occasion is very rare on which  you can't succeed.
"    "And that reminds me," said Donald, with a laugh, "that a week ago I  came to start a fight with you.
 What has become of that fight we were  going to have, anyway?"    "You can search me," laughed Linda, throwing out her hands in a graceful  gesture.
 "There's not a scrap of fight in my system concerning you, but  if Oka Sayye were having a fight with you and I were anywhere around,  you'd have one friend who would help you to handle the Jap.
"    Donald looked at Linda thoughtfully.
    "By the great hocus-pocus," he said, "you know, I believe you.
 If two  fellows were having a pitched battle most of the girls I know would  quietly faint or run, but I do believe that you would stand by and help  a fellow if he needed it.
"    "That I surely would," said Linda; "but don't you say 'most of the girls  I know' and then make a statement like that concerning girls, because  you prove that you don't know them at all.
 A few years ago, I very  distinctly recall how angry many women were at this line in one of  Kipling's poems:        The female of the species is more deadly than the male,    and there was nothing to it save that a great poet was trying to pay  womanhood everywhere the finest compliment he knew how.
 He always has  been fundamental in his process of thought.
 He gets right back to the  heart of primal things.
 When he wrote that line he was not really  thinking that there was a nasty poison in the heart of a woman or death  in her hands.
 What he was thinking was that in the jungle the female  lion or tiger or jaguar must go and find a particularly secluded cave  and bear her young and raise them to be quite active kittens before she  leads them out, because there is danger of the bloodthirsty father  eating them when they are tiny and helpless.
 And if perchance a male  finds the cave of his mate and her tiny young and enters it to do  mischief, then there is no recorded instance I know of in which the  female, fighting in defense of her young, has not been 'more deadly than  the male.
' And that is the origin of the much-discussed line concerning  the female of the species, and it holds good fairly well down the line  of the wild.
 It's even true among such tiny things as guinea pigs and  canary birds.
 There is a mother element in the heart of every girl.
  Daddy used to say that half the women in the world married the men they  did because they wanted to mother them.
 You can't tell what is in a  woman's heart by looking at her.
 You must bring her face to face with an  emergency before you can say what she'll do, but I would be perfectly  willing to stake my life on this: There is scarcely a girl you know who  would see you getting the worst of a fight, say with Oka Sayye, or  someone who meant to kill you or injure you, who would not pick up the  first weapon she could lay her hands on, whether it was an axe or a  stick or a stone, and go to your defense, and if she had nothing else to  fight with, I have heard of women who put up rather a tidy battle with  their claws.
 Sounds primitive, doesn't it?"    "It sounds true," said Donald reflectively.
 "I see, young lady, where  one is going to have to measure his words and think before he talks to  you.
"    "Pretty thought!" said Linda lightly.
 "We'll have a great time if you  must stop to consider every word before you say it.
"    "Well, anyway," said Donald, "when are we going to have that fight which  was the purpose of our coming together?"    "Why, we're not ever going to have it," answered Linda.
 "I have got  nothing in this world to fight with you about since you're doing  your level best to beat Oka Sayye.
 I have watched your head above the  remainder of your class for three years and wanted to fight with you on  that point.
"    "Now that's a queer thing," said Donald, "because I have watched you for  three years and wanted to fight with you about your drygoods, and now  since I've known you only such a short while, I don't care two whoops  what you wear.
 It's a matter of perfect indifference to me.
 You can wear  French heels or baby pumps, or go barefoot.
 You would still be you.
"     "Is it a truce?" asked Linda.
  I    "No, ma'am," said Donald, "it's not a truce.
 That implies war and  we haven't fought.
 It's not armed neutrality; it's not even watchful  waiting.
 It's my friend, Linda Strong.
 Me for her and her for me, if you  say so.
"    He reached out his hand.
 Linda laid hers in it, and looking into his  eyes, she said: "That is a compact.
 We'll test this friendship business  and see what there is to it.
 Now come on; let's run for the canyon.
"    It was only a short time until the Bear Cat followed its trail of the  previous Saturday, and, rushing across the stream, stopped at its former  resting place, while Linda and Donald sat looking at the sheer-walled  little room before them.
    "I can see," said Linda, "a stronger tinge in the green.
 There are more  flowers in the carpet.
 There is more melody in the birds' song.
 We are  going to have a better time than we had last Saturday.
 First let's fix  up our old furnace, because we must have a fire today.
"    So they left the car, and under Linda's direction they reconstructed  the old fireplace at which the girl and her father had cooked when  botanizing in Multiflores.
 In a corner secluded from wind, using the  wall of the canyon for a back wall, big boulders the right distance  apart on each side, and small stones for chinking, Linda superintended  the rebuilding of the fireplace.
    She unpacked the lunch box, set the table, and when she had everything  in readiness she covered the table, and taking a package, she carried it  on a couple of aluminium pie pans to where her fire was burning crisply.
  With a small field axe she chopped a couple of small green branches,  pointed them to her liking, and peeled them.
 Then she made a poker from  one of the saplings they had used to move the rocks, and beat down her  fire until she had a bright bed of deep coals.
 When these were arranged  exactly to her satisfaction, she pulled some sprays of deer weed  bloom from her bundle and, going down to the creek, made a lather and  carefully washed her hands, tucking the towel she used in drying them  through her belt.
 Then she came back to the fire and, sitting down  beside it, opened the package and began her operations.
 On the long,  slender sticks she strung a piece of tenderloin beef, about three inches  in circumference and one fourth of an inch in thickness, then half a  slice of bacon, and then a slice of onion.
 This she repeated until her  skewer would bear no more weight.
 Then she laid it across the rocks  walling her fire, occasionally turning it while she filled the second  skewer.
 Then she brought from the car the bucket of pulp she had taken  from the barrel cactus, transferred it to a piece of cheesecloth and  deftly extracted the juice.
 To this she added the contents of a thermos  bottle containing a pint of sugar that had been brought to the boiling  point with a pint of water and poured over some chopped spearmint to  which had been added the juice of half a dozen lemons and three or four  oranges.
 From a small, metal-lined compartment, Linda took a chunk of  ice and dropped it into this mixture.
    She was sitting on the ground, one foot doubled under her, the other  extended.
 She had taken off her hat; the wind and the bushes had  roughened her hair.
 Exercise had brought deep red to her cheeks and  her lips.
 Happiness had brought a mellow glow to her dark eyes.
 She  had turned back her sleeves, and her slender hands were fascinatingly  graceful in their deft handling of everything she touched.
 They were  a second edition of the hands with which Alexander Strong had felt out  defective nerve systems and made delicate muscular adjustments.
 She was  wholly absorbed in what she was doing.
 Sitting on the blanket across  from her Donald Whiting was wholly absorbed in her and he was thinking.
  He was planning how he could please her, how he could earn her  friendship.
 He was admitting to himself that he had very little, if  anything, to show for hours of time that he had spent in dancing, at  card games, beach picnics, and races.
 All these things had been amusing.
  But he had nothing to show for the time he had spent or the money he had  wasted.
 Nothing had happened that in any way equipped him for his battle  with Oka Sayye.
 Conversely, this girl, whom he had resented, whom he had  criticized, who had claimed his notice only by her radical difference  from the other girls, had managed, during the few minutes he had first  talked with her in the hall, to wound his pride, to spur his ambition,  to start him on a course that must end in lasting and material benefit  to him even if he failed in making a higher record of scholarship than  Oka Sayye.
 It was very certain that the exercise he was giving his  brain must be beneficial.
 He had learned many things that were intensely  interesting to him and he had not even touched the surface of what he  could see that she had been taught by her father or had learned through  experience and personal investigation.
 She had been coming to the  mountains and the canyons alone, for four years doing by herself what  she would have done under her father's supervision had he lived.
 That  argued for steadfastness and strength of character.
 She would not utter  one word of flattery.
 She would say nothing she did not mean.
 Watching  her intently, Donald Whiting thought of all these things.
 He thought of  what she had said about fighting for him, and he wondered if it really  was true that any girl he knew would fight for him.
 He hardly believed  it when he remembered some of his friends, so entirely devoted to  personal adornment and personal gratification.
 But Linda had said that  all women were alike in their hearts.
 She knew about other things.
 She  must know about this.
 Maybe all women would fight for their young or for  their men, but he knew of no other girl who could drive a Bear Cat with  the precision and skill with which Linda drove.
 He knew no other girl  who was master of the secrets of the desert and the canyons and the  mountains.
 Certainly he knew no other girl who would tug at great  boulders and build a fireplace and risk burning her fingers and  scorching her face to prepare a meal for him.
 So he watched Linda and so  he thought.
    At first he thought she was the finest pal a boy ever had, and then he  thought how he meant to work to earn and keep her friendship; and then,  as the fire reddened Linda's cheeks and she made running comments while  she deftly turned her skewers of brigand beefsteak, food that half the  Boy Scouts in the country had been eating for four years, there came an  idea with which he dallied until it grew into a luring vision.
    "Linda," he asked suddenly, "do you know that one of these days you're  going to be a beautiful woman?"    Linda turned her skewers with intense absorption.
 At first he almost  thought she had not heard him, but at last she said quietly: "Do you  really think that is possible, Donald?"    "You're lovely right now!" answered the boy promptly.
    "For goodness' sake, have an eye single to your record for truth and  veracity," said Linda.
 "Doesn't this begin to smell zippy?"    "It certainly does," said Donald.
 "It's making me ravenous.
 But honest,  Linda, you are a pretty girl.
"    "Honest, your foot!" said Linda scornfully.
 "I am not a pretty girl.
  I am lean and bony and I've got a beak where I should have a nose.
  Speaking of pretty girls, my sister, Eileen, is a pretty girl.
 She is a  downright beautiful girl.
"    "Yes," said Donald, "she is, but she can't hold a candle to you.
 How did  she look when she was your age?"    "I can't remember Eileen," said Linda, "when she was not exquisitely  dressed and thinking more about taking care of her shoes than anything  else in the world.
 I can't remember her when she was not curled, and  even when she was a tiny thing Mother put a dust of powder on her nose.
  She said her skin was so delicate that it could not bear the sun.
 She  never could run or play or motor much or do anything, because she  has always had to be saved for the sole purpose of being exquisitely  beautiful.
 Talk about lilies of the field, that's what Eileen is! She  is an improvement on the original lily of the field--she's a lily of the  drawing room.
 Me, now, I'm more of a Joshua tree.
"    Donald Whiting laughed, as Linda intended that he should.
    A minute afterward she slid the savory food from a skewer upon one of  the pie pans, tossed back the cover from the little table, stacked  some bread-and-butter sandwiches beside the meat and handed the pan to  Donald.
    "Fall to," she said, "and prove that you're a man with an appreciative  tummy.
 Father used to be positively ravenous for this stuff.
 I like it  myself.
"    She slid the food from the second skewer to a pan for herself, settled  the fire to her satisfaction and they began their meal.
 Presently she  filled a cup from the bucket beside her and handed it to Donald.
 At the  same time she lifted another for herself.
    "Here's to the barrel cactus," she said.
 "May the desert grow enough  of them so that we'll never lack one when we want to have a Saturday  picnic.
"    Laughingly they drank this toast; and the skewers were filled a second  time.
 When they could eat no more they packed away the lunch things,  buried the fire, took the axe and the field glasses, and started on a  trip of exploration down the canyon.
 Together they admired delicate  and exquisite ferns growing around great gray boulders.
 Donald tasted  hunters' rock leek, and learned that any he found while on a hunting  expedition would furnish a splendid substitute for water.
 Linda told him  of rare flowers she lacked and what they were like and how he would be  able to identify what she wanted in case he should ever find any when he  was out hunting or with his other friends.
 They peeped into the nesting  places of canyon wrens and doves and finches, and listened to the  exquisite courting songs of the birds whose hearts were almost bursting  with the exuberance of spring and the joy of home making.
 When they were  tired out they went back to the dining room and after resting a time,  they made a supper from the remnants of their dinner.
 When they were  seated in the car and Linda's hand was on the steering wheel, Donald  reached across and covered it with his own.
    "Wait a bit," he said.
 "Before we leave here I want to ask you a  question and I want you to make me a promise.
"    "All right," said Linda.
 "What's your question?"    "What is there," said Donald, "that I can do that would give you such  pleasure as you have given me?"    Linda could jest on occasions, but by nature she was a serious person.
  She looked at Donald reflectively.
    "Why, I think," she said at last, "that having a friend, having someone  who understands and who cares for the things I do, and who likes to go  to the same places and to do the same things, is the biggest thing that  has happened to me since I lost my father.
 I don't see that you are in  any way in my debt, Donald.
"    "All right then," said the boy, "that brings me to the promise I want  you to make me.
 May we always have our Saturdays together like this?"    "Sure!" said Linda, "I would be mightily pleased.
 I'll have to work  later at night and scheme, maybe.
 By good rights Saturday belongs to me  anyway because I am born Saturday's child.
"    "Well, hurrah for Saturday! It always was a grand old day," said Donald,  "and since I see what it can do in turning out a girl like you, I've got  a better opinion of it than ever.
 We'll call that settled.
 I'll always  ask you on Friday at what hour to come, and hereafter Saturday is ours.
"    "Ours it is," said Linda.
    Then she put the Bear Cat through the creek and on the road and, driving  swiftly as she dared, ran to Lilac Valley and up to Peter Morrison's  location.
    She was amazed at the amount of work that had been accomplished.
 The  garage was finished.
 Peter's temporary work desk and his cot were in it.
  A number of his personal belongings were there.
 The site for his house  had been selected and the cellar was being excavated.
    Linda descended from the Bear Cat and led Donald before Peter.
    "Since you're both my friends," she said, "I want you to know each  other.
 This is Donald Whiting, the Senior I told you about, Mr.  Morrison.
 You know you said you would help him if you could.
"    "Certainly," said Peter.
 "I am very glad to know any friend of yours,  Miss Linda.
 Come over to my workroom and let's hear about this.
"    "Oh, go and talk it over between yourselves," said Linda.
 "I am going up  here to have a private conversation with the spring.
 I want it to tell  me confidentially exactly the course it would enjoy running so that when  your house is finished and I come to lay out your grounds I will know  exactly how it feels about making a change.
"    "Fine!" said Peter.
 "Take your time and become extremely confidential,  because the more I look at the location and the more I hear the gay  chuckling song that that water sings, the more I am in love with your  plan to run it across the lawn and bring it around the boulder.
"    "It would be a downright sin not to have that water in a convenient  place for your children to play in, Peter," said Linda.
    "Then that's all settled," said Peter.
 "Now, Whiting, come this way and  we'll see whether I can suggest anything that will help you with your  problem.
"    "Whistle when you are ready, Donald," called Linda as she turned away.
    Peter Morrison glanced after her a second, and then he led Donald  Whiting to a nail keg in the garage and impaled that youngster on  the mental point of a mental pin and studied him as carefully as any  scientist ever studied a rare specimen.
 When finally he let him go, his  mental comment was: "He's a mighty fine kid.
 Linda is perfectly safe  with him.
"        .
 Linda's Hearthstone    Early the following week Linda came from school one evening to find a  load of sand and a heap of curiously marked stones beside the back door.
    "Can it possibly be, Katy," she asked, "that those men are planning to  begin work on my room so soon? I am scared out of almost seven of my  five senses.
 I had no idea they would be ready to begin work until after  I had my settlement with Eileen or was paid for the books.
"    "Don't ye be worried," said Katy.
 "There's more in me stocking than me  leg, and you're as welcome to it as the desert is welcome to rain, an'  nadin' it 'most as bad.
"    "Anyway," said Linda, "it will surely take them long enough so that I  can pay by the time they finish.
"    But Linda was not figuring that back of the projected improvements  stood two men, each of whom had an extremely personal reason for greatly  desiring to please her.
 Peter Morrison had secured a slab of sandstone.
  He had located a marble cutter to whom he meant to carry it, and was  spending much thought that he might have been using on an article in  trying to hit upon exactly the right line or phrase to build in above  Linda's fire--something that would convey to her in a few words a sense  of friendship and beauty.
    While Peter gazed at the unresponsive gray sandstone and wrote line  after line which he immediately destroyed, Henry Anderson explored the  mountain and came in, red faced and perspiring, from miles of climbing  with a bright stone in each hand, or took the car to bring in small  heaps too heavy to carry that he had collected near the roads.
 They were  two men striving for the favor of the same girl.
 How Linda would have  been amused had she understood the situation, or how Eileen would have  been provoked, neither of the men knew nor did they care.
    The workmen came after Linda left and went before her return.
 Having  been cautioned to silence, Katy had not told her when work actually  began; and so it happened that, going to her room one evening, she  unlocked the door and stepped inside to face the completed fireplace.
  The firebox was not very large but ample.
 The hearthstone was a  big sheet of smooth gray sandstone.
 The sides and top were Henry's  collection of brilliant boulders, carefully and artistically laid  in blue mortar, and over the firebox was set Peter's slab of gray  sandstone.
 On it were four deeply carved lines.
 The quaint Old English  lettering was filled even to the surface with a red mortar, while the  capitals were done in dull blue.
 The girl slowly read:      Voiceless stones, with Flame-tongues Preach     Sermons struck  from Nature's Lyre; Notes of Love and Trust and Hope Hourly sing in  Linda's Fire.
    In the firebox stood a squat pair of black andirons, showing age and  usage.
 A rough eucalyptus log waited across them while the shavings from  the placing of the mantel and the cutting of the windows were tucked  beneath it.
 Linda stood absorbed a minute.
 She looked at the skylight,  flooding the room with the light she so needed coming from the right  angle.
 She went over to the new window that gave her a view of the  length of the valley she loved and a most essential draft.
 When she  turned back to the fireplace her hands were trembling.
    "Now isn't that too lovely of them?" she said softly.
 "Isn't that  altogether wonderful? How I wish Daddy were here to sit beside my fire  and share with me the work I hope to do here.
"    In order to come as close to him as possible she did the next best  thing.
 She sat down at her table and wrote a long letter to Marian,  telling her everything she could think of that would interest her.
  Then she re-read with extreme care the letter she had found at the Post  Office that day in reply to the one she had written Marian purporting to  come from an admirer.
 Writing slowly and thinking deeply, she answered  it.
 She tried to imagine that she was Peter Morrison and she tried to  say the things in that letter that she thought Peter would say in the  circumstances, because she felt sure that Marian would be entertained  by such things as Peter would say.
 When she finished, she read it over  carefully, and then copied it with equal care on the typewriter, which  she had removed to her workroom.
    When she heard Katy's footstep outside her door, she opened it and drew  her in, slipping the bolt behind her.
 She led her to the fireplace and  recited the lines.
    "Now ain't they jist the finest gentlemen?" said Katy.
 "Cut right off  of a piece of the same cloth as your father.
 Now some way we must  get together enough money to get ye a good-sized rug for under your  worktable, and then ye've got to have two bits of small ones, one for  your hearthstone and one for your aisel; and then ye're ready, colleen,  to show what ye can do.
 I'm so proud of ye when I think of the grand  secret it's keepin' for ye I am; and less and less are gettin' me  chances for the salvation of me soul, for every night I'm a-sittin'  starin' at the magazines ye gave me when I ought to be tellin' me beads  and makin' me devotions.
 Ain't it about time the third was comin' in?"    "Any day now," said Linda in a whisper.
 "And, Katy, you'll be careful?  That editor must think that 'Jane Meredith' is full of years and ripe  experience.
 I probably wouldn't get ten cents, no not even a for-nothing  chance, if he knew those articles were written by a Junior.
"    "Junior nothing!" scoffed Katy.
 "There was not a day of his life that  your pa did not spend hours drillin' ye in things the rest of the  girls in your school never heard of.
 'Tain't no high-school girl that's  written them articles.
 It's Alexander Strong speakin' through the medium  of his own flesh and blood.
"    "Why, so it is, Katy!" cried Linda delightedly.
 "You know, I never  thought of that.
 I have been so egoistical I thought I was doing them  myself.
"    "Paid ye anything yet?" queried Katy.
    "No," said Linda, "they haven't.
 It seems that the amount of interest  the articles evoke is going to decide what I am to be paid for them, but  they certainly couldn't take the recipe and the comments and the sketch  for less than twenty-five or thirty dollars, unless recipes are like  poetry.
 Peter said the other day that if a poet did not have some other  profession to support him, he would starve to death on all he was paid  for writing the most beautiful things that ever are written in all this  world.
 Peter says even an effort to write a poem is a beautiful thing.
"    "Well, maybe that used to be the truth," said Katy as she started toward  the door, "but I have been reading some things labeled 'poetry' in the  magazines of late, and if the holy father knows what they mean, he's  even bigger than ever I took him to be.
"    "Katy," said Linda, "we are dreadful back numbers.
 We are letting this  world progress and roll right on past us without a struggle.
 We haven't  either one been to a psychoanalyst to find out the color of our auras.
"    "Now God forbid," said Katy.
 "I ain't going to have one of them things  around me.
 The colors I'm wearin' satisfy me entoirely.
"    "And mine are going to satisfy me very shortly, now," laughed Linda,  "because tomorrow is my big day with Eileen.
 Next time we have a minute  together, old dear, I'll have started my bank account.
"    "Right ye are," said Katy, "jist exactly right.
 You're getting such  a great girl it's the proper thing ye should be suitably dressed, and  don't ye be too modest.
"    "The unfortunate thing about that, Katy, is that l intimated the other  day that I would be content with less than half, since she is older and  she should have her chance first.
"    "Now ain't that jist like ye?" said Katy.
 "I might have known ye would  be doing that very thing.
"    "After I have gone over the accounts," said Linda, "I'll know better  what to demand.
 Now fly to your cooking, Katy, and let me sit down at  this table and see if I can dig out a few dollars of honest coin; but  I'm going to have hard work to keep my eyes on the paper with that  fireplace before me.
 Isn't that red and blue lettering the prettiest  thing, Katy, and do you notice that tiny 'P.
 M.
' cut down in the lower  left-hand corner nearly out of sight? That, Katy, stands for 'Peter  Morrison,' and one of these days Peter is going to be a large figure on  the landscape.
 The next Post he has an article in I'll buy for you.
"    "It never does," said Katy, "to be makin' up your mind in this world so  hard and fast that ye can't change it.
 In the days before John Gilman  got bewitched out of his senses I did think, barrin' your father, that  he was the finest man the Lord ever made; but I ain't thought so much of  him of late as I did before.
"    "Same holds good for me," said Linda.
    "I've studied this Peter," continued Katy, "like your pa used to study  things under his microscope.
 He's the most come-at-able man.
 He's got  such a kind of a questionin' look on his face, and there's a bit of a  stoop to his shoulders like they had been whittled out for carryin'  a load, and there's a kind of a whimsy quiverin' around his lips that  makes me heart stand still every time he speaks to me, because I can't  be certain whether he is going to make me laugh or going to make me cry,  and when what he's sayin' does come with that little slow drawl, I can't  be just sure whether he's meanin' it or whether he's jist pokin' fun  at me.
 He said the quarest thing to me the other day when he was here  fiddlin' over the makin' of this fireplace.
 He was standin' out beside  your desert garden and I come aven with him and I says to him: 'Them's  the rare plants Miss Linda and her pa have been goin' to the deserts and  the canyons, as long as he lived, to fetch in; and then Miss Linda  went alone, and now the son of Judge Whiting, the biggest lawyer in Los  Angeles, has begun goin' with her.
 Ain't it the brightest, prettiest  place?' I says to him.
 And he stood there lookin', and he says to me:  'No, Katy, that is a graveyard.
' Now what in the name of raison was the  man meanin' by that?"    Linda stared at the hearth motto reflectively.
    "A graveyard!" she repeated.
 "Well, if anything could come farther from  a graveyard than that spot, I don't know how it would do it.
 I haven't  the remotest notion what he meant.
 Why didn't you ask him?"    "Well, the truth is," said Katy, "that I proide myself on being able to  kape me mouth shut when I should.
"    "I'll leave to think over it," said Linda.
 "At present I have no  more idea than you in what respect my desert garden could resemble a  graveyard.
 Oh! yes, there's one thing I wanted to ask you, Katy.
 Has  Eileen been around while this room was being altered?"    "She came in yesterday," answered Katy, "when the hammerin' and sawin'  was goin' full blast.
"    "What I wanted to find out'" said Linda, "was whether she had been here  and seen this room or not, because if she hasn't and she wants to see  it, now is her time.
 After I get things going here and these walls are  covered with drying sketches this room is going to be strictly private.
  You see that you keep your key where nobody gets hold of it.
"    "It's on a string round me neck this blessed minute," said Katy.
 "I  didn't see her come up here, but ye could be safe in bettin' anything  ye've got that she came.
"    "Yes, I imagine she did," said Linda.
 "She would be sufficiently curious  that she would come to learn how much I have spent if she had no other  interest in me.
"    She looked at the fireplace reflectively.
    "I wonder," she said, "what Eileen thought of that and I wonder if she  noticed that little 'P.
 M.
' tucked away down there in the corner.
"    "Sure she did," said Katy.
 "She has got eyes like a cat.
 She can see  more things in a shorter time than anybody I ever knew.
" So that evening  at dinner Linda told Eileen that the improvements she had made for her  convenience in the billiard room were finished, and asked her if she  would like to see them.
    "I can't imagine what you want to stick yourself off up there alone  for," said Eileen.
 "I don't believe I am sufficiently interested in  garret skylights and windows to climb up to look at them.
 What everybody  in the neighborhood can see is that you have absolutely ruined the looks  of the back part of the house.
"    "Good gracious!" said Linda.
 "Have I? You know I never thought of that.
"    "Of course! But all you've got to do is go on the cast lawn and take  a look at that side and the back end of the house to see what you have  done," said Eileen.
 "Undoubtedly you've cut the selling price of the  house one thousand, at least.
 But it's exactly like you not to have  thought of what chopping up the roof and the end of the house as  you have done, would make it look like.
 You have got one of those  single-track minds, Linda, that can think of only one thing at a time,  and you never do think, when you start anything, of what the end is  going to be.
"    "Very likely there's a large amount of truth in that," said Linda  soberly.
 "Perhaps I do get an idea and pursue it to the exclusion of  everything else.
 It's an inheritance from Daddy, this concentrating  with all my might on one thing at a time.
 But I am very sorry if I have  disfigured the house.
"    "What I want to know," said Eileen, "is how in this world, at present  wages and cost of material, you're expecting to pay men for the work you  have had done.
"    "I can talk more understandingly about that," said Linda quietly, "day  after tomorrow.
 I'll get home from school tomorrow as early as I can,  and then we'll figure out our financial situation exactly.
"    Eileen made no reply.
        .
 Producing the Evidence    When Linda hurried home the next evening, her first word to Katy was to  ask if Eileen were there.
    "No, she isn't here," said Katy, "and she's not going to be.
"    "Not going to be!" cried Linda, her face paling perceptibly.
    "She went downtown this morning and she telephoned me about three  sayin' she had an invoitation to go with a motor party to Pasadena this  afternoon, an' she wasn't knowin' whether she could get home the night  or not.
"    "I don't like it," said Linda.
 "I don't like it at all.
"    She liked it still less when Eileen came home for a change of clothing  the following day, and again went to spend the night with a friend,  without leaving any word whatever.
    "I don't understand this," said Linda, white lipped and tense.
 "She does  not want to see me.
 She does not intend to talk business with me if she  can possibly help it.
 She is treating me as if I were a four-year-old  instead of a woman with as much brain as she has.
 If she appears while  I am gone tomorrow and starts away again, you tell her Come to think of  it, you needn't tell her anything; I'll give you a note for her.
"    So Linda sat down and wrote:    DEAR EILEEN:    It won't be necessary to remind you of our agreement night before last  to settle on an allowance from Father's estate for me.
 Of course I  realize that you are purposely avoiding seeing me, for what reason I  can't imagine; but I give you warning, that if you have been in this  house and have read this note, and are not here with your figures ready  to meet me when I get home tomorrow night, I'll take matters into my own  hands, and do exactly what I think best without the slightest reference  to what you think about it.
 If you don't want something done that you  will dislike, even more than you dislike seeing me, you had better heed  this warning.
    LINDA.
    She read it over slowly: "My, that sounds melodramatic!" she commented.
  "It's even got a threat in it, and it's a funny thing to threaten my own  sister.
 I don't think that it's a situation that occurs very frequently,  but for that matter I sincerely hope that Eileen isn't the kind of  sister that occurs frequently.
"    Linda went up to her room and tried to settle herself to work, but found  that it was impossible to fix her attention on what she was doing.
 Her  mind jumped from one thing to another in a way that totally prohibited  effective work of any kind.
 A sudden resolve came into her heart.
 She  would not wait any longer.
 She would know for herself just how she was  situated financially.
 She wrote a note to the editor of Everybody's  Home, asking him if it would be convenient to let her know what  reception her work was having with his subscribers, whether he desired  her to continue the department in his magazines, and if so, what was  the best offer he could make her for the recipes, the natural history  comments accompanying them, and the sketches.
 Then she went down to the  telephone book and looked up the location of the Consolidated Bank.
 She  decided that she would stop there on her way from school the next day  and ask to be shown the Strong accounts.
    While she was meditating these heroic measures the bell rang and Katy  admitted John Gilman.
 Strangely enough, he was asking for Linda, not for  Eileen.
 At the first glimpse of him Linda knew that something was wrong;  so without any prelude she said abruptly: "What's the matter, John?  Don't you know where I Eileen is either?"    "Approximately," he answered.
 "She has 'phoned me two or three times,  but I haven't seen her for three days.
 Do you know where she is or  exactly why she is keeping away from home as she is?"    "Yes," said Linda, "I do.
 I told you the other day the time had come  when I was going to demand a settlement of Father's estate and a fixed  income.
 That time came three days ago and I have not seen Eileen since.
"    They entered the living room.
 As Linda passed the table, propped against  a candlestick on it, she noticed a note addressed to herself.
    "Oh, here will be an explanation," she said.
 "Here is a note for me.
 Sit  down a minute till I read it.
"    She seated herself on the arm of a chair, tore open the note, and  instantly began reading aloud.
    "Dear little sister--"    "Pathetic," interpolated Linda, "in consideration of the fact that I am  about twice as big as she is.
 However, we'll let that go, and focus on  the enclosure.
" She waved a slender slip of paper at Gilman.
 "I never  was possessed of an article like this before in all my tender young  life, but it seems to me that it's a cheque, and I can't tell you quite  how deeply it amuses me.
 But to return to business, at the present  instant I am:    DEAR LITTLE SISTER:    It seems that all the friends I have are particularly insistent on  seeing me all at once and all in a rush.
 I don't think I ever had quite  so many invitations at one time in my life before, and the next two or  three days seem to be going to be equally as full.
 But I took time to  run into the bank and go over things carefully.
 I find that after the  payment of taxes and insurance and all the household expenses, that by  wearing old clothes I have and making them over I can afford to turn  over at least seventy-five dollars a month to you for your clothing and  personal expenses.
 As I don't know exactly when I can get home, I am  enclosing a cheque which is considerably larger than I had supposed I  could make it, and I can only do this by skimping myself; but of course  you are getting such a big girl and beginning to attract attention, so  it is only right that you should have the very best that I can afford to  do for you.
 I am not taking the bill from The Mode into consideration.
 I  paid that with last month's expenses.
    With love,    EILEEN.
    Linda held the letter in one hand, the cheque in the other, and stared  questioningly at John Gilman.
    "What do you think of that?" she inquired tersely.
    "It seems to me," said Gilman, "that a more pertinent question would be,  what do you think of it?"    "Rot!" said Linda tersely.
 "If I were a stenographer in your office I  would think that I was making a fairly good start; but I happen to be  the daughter of Alexander Strong living in my own home with my  only sister, who can afford to flit like the flittingest of social  butterflies from one party to another as well dressed as, and better  dressed than, the Great General Average.
 You have known us, John, ever  since Eileen sat in the sun to dry her handmade curls, while I was  leaving a piece of my dress on every busk in Multiflores Canyon.
 Right  here and now I am going to show you something!"    Linda started upstairs, so John Gilman followed her.
 She went to the  door of Eileen's suite and opened it.
    "Now then," she said, "take a look at what Eileen feels she can afford  for herself.
 You will observe she has complete and exquisite furnishings  and all sorts of feminine accessories on her dressing table.
 You will  observe that she has fine rugs in her dressing room and bathroom.
 Let me  call your attention to the fact that all these drawers are filled with  expensive comforts and conveniences.
"    Angrily Linda began to open drawers filled with fancy feminine apparel,  daintily and neatly folded, everything in perfect order: gloves, hose,  handkerchiefs, ribbons, laces, all in separate compartments She  pointed to the high chiffonier, the top decorated with candlesticks and  silver-framed pictures.
 Here the drawers revealed heaps of embroidered  underclothing and silken garments.
 Then she walked to the closet and  threw the door wide.
    She pushed hangers on their rods, sliding before the perplexed and  bewildered man dress after dress of lace and georgette, walking suits of  cloth, street dresses of silk, and pretty afternoon gowns, heavy coats,  light coats, a beautiful evening coat.
 Linda took this down and held it  in front of John Gilman.
    "I see things marked in store windows," she said.
 "Eileen paid not a  penny less than three hundred for this one coat.
 Look at the rows of  shoes, and pumps, and slippers, and what that box is or I don't know.
"    Linda slid to the light a box screened by the hanging dresses, and  with the toe of her shoe lifted the lid, disclosing a complete smoking  outfit--case after case of cigarettes.
 Linda dropped the lid and shoved  the box back.
 She stood silent a second, then she looked at John Gilman.
    "That is the way things go in this world," she said quietly.
 "Whenever  you lose your temper, you always do something you didn't intend to do  when you started.
 I didn't know that, and I wouldn't have shown it to  you purposely if I had known it; but it doesn't alter the fact that you  should know it.
 If you did know it no harm's done but if you didn't know  it, you shouldn't be allowed to marry Eileen without knowing as much  about her as you did about Marian, and there was nothing about Marian  that you didn't know.
 I am sorry for that, but since I have started this  I am going through with it.
 Now give me just one minute more.
"    Then she went down the hall, threw open the door to her room, and  walking in said: "You have seen Eileen's surroundings; now take a look  at mine.
 There's my bed; there's my dresser and toilet articles; and  this is my wardrobe.
"    She opened the closet door and exhibited a pair of overalls in which she  watered her desert garden.
 Next ranged her khaki breeches and felt hat.
  Then hung the old serge school dress, beside it the extra skirt and  orange blouse.
 The stack of underclothing on the shelves was pitifully  small, visibly dilapidated.
 Two or three outgrown gingham dresses hung  forlornly on the opposite wall.
 Linda stood tall and straight before  John Gilman.
    "What I have on and one other waist constitute my wardrobe," she said,  "and I told Eileen where to get this dress and suggested it before I got  it.
"    Gilman looked at her in a dazed fashion.
    "I don't understand," he said slowly.
 "If that isn't the dress I saw  Eileen send up for herself, I'm badly mistaken.
 It was the Saturday we  went to Riverside.
 It surely is the very dress.
"    Linda laughed bleakly.
    "That may be," she said.
 "The one time she ever has any respect for me  is in a question of taste.
 She will agree that I know when colors are  right and a thing is artistic.
 Now then, John, you are the administrator  of my father's estate; you have seen what you have seen.
 What are you  going to do about it?"    "Linda," he said quietly, "what my heart might prompt me to do in  consideration of the fact that I am engaged to marry Eileen, and what my  legal sense tells me I must do as executor of your father's wishes, are  different propositions.
 I am going to do exactly what you tell me to.
  What you have shown me, and what I'd have realized, if I had stopped to  think, is neither right nor just.
"    Then Linda took her tun at deep thought.
    "John," she said at last, "I am feeling depressed over what I have just  done.
 I am not sure that in losing my temper and bringing you up here I  have played the game fairly.
 You don't need to do anything.
 I'll manage  my affairs with Eileen myself.
 But I'll tell you before you go, that you  needn't practice any subterfuges.
 When she reaches the point where she  is ready to come home, I'll tell her that you were here, and what you  have seen.
 That is the best I can do toward squaring myself with my own  conscience.
"    Slowly they walked down the hall together.
 At the head of the stairs  Linda took the cheque that she carried and tore it into bits.
 Stepping  across the hall, she let the little heap slowly flutter to the rug in  front of Eileen's door.
 Then she went back to her room and left John  Gilman to his own reflections.
        .
 A Rock and a Flame    The first time Linda entered the kitchen after her interview with  Gilman, Katy asked in deep concern, "Now what ye been doing, lambie?"    "Doing the baby act, Katy," confessed Linda.
 "Disgracing myself.
 Losing  my temper.
 I wish I could bring myself to the place where I would think  half a dozen times before I do a thing once.
"    "Now look here," said Katy, beginning to bristle, "ain't it the truth  that ye have thought for four years before ye did this thing once?"    "Quite so," said Linda.
 "But since I am the daughter of the finest  gentleman I ever knew, I should not do hasty, regrettable things.
 On the  living-room table I found a note sweeter than honey, and it contained a  cheque for me that wouldn't pay Eileen's bills for lunches, candy,  and theaters for a month; so in undue heat I reduced it to bits and  decorated the rug before her door.
 But before that, Katy, I led my  guardian into the room, and showed him everything.
 I meant to tell him  that, since he had neglected me for four years, he could see that I had  justice now, but when I'd personally conducted him from Eileen's room  to mine, and when I took a good look at him there was something on his  face, Katy, that I couldn't endure.
 So I told him to leave it to me;  that I would tell Eileen myself what I had done, and so I will.
 But I am  sorry I did it, Katy; I am awfully sorry.
 You always told me to keep  my temper and I lost it completely.
 From now on I certainly will try to  behave myself more like a woman than a spoiled child.
 Now give me a dust  cloth and brushes.
 I am almost through with my job in the library and  I want to finish, because I shall be forced to use the money from the  books to pay for my skylight and fireplace.
"    Linda went to the library and began work, efficiently, carefully, yet  with a precise rapidity habitual to her.
 Down the long line of heavy  technical books, she came to the end of the shelf.
 Three books from  the end she noticed a difference in the wall behind the shelf.
 Hastily  removing the other two volumes, she disclosed a small locked door having  a scrap of paper protruding from the edge which she pulled out and upon  which she read:    In the event of my passing, should anyone move these books and find this  door, these lines are to inform him that it is to remain untouched.
 The  key to it is in my safety-deposit vault at the Consolidated Bank.
 The  Bank will open the door and attend to the contents of the box at the  proper time.
    Linda fixed the paper back exactly as she had found it.
 She stood  looking at the door a long time, then she carefully wiped it, the wall  around it, and the shelf.
 Going to another shelf, she picked out the  books that had been written by her father and, beginning at the end of  the shelf, she ranged them in a row until they completely covered the  opening.
 Then she finished filling the shelf with other books that she  meant to keep, but her brain was working, milling over and over the  question of what that little compartment contained and when it was to  be opened and whether John Gilman knew about it, and whether the  Consolidated Bank would remember the day specified, and whether it would  mean anything important to her.
    She carried the dusters back to Katy, and going to her room,  concentrated resolutely upon her work; but she Was unable to do anything  constructive.
 Her routine lessons she could prepare, but she could not  even sketch a wild rose accurately.
 Finally she laid down her pencil,  washed her brushes, put away her material, and locking her door, slipped  the key into her pocket.
 Going down to the garage she climbed into the  Bear Cat and headed straight for Peter Morrison.
 She drove into his  location and blew the horn.
 Peter stepped from the garage, and seeing  her, started in her direction.
 Linda sprang down and hurried toward  him.
 He looked at her intently as she approached and formed his own  conclusions.
    "Sort of restless," said Linda.
 "Couldn't evolve a single new idea with  which to enliven the gay annals of English literature and Greek history.
  A personal history seems infinitely more insistent and unusual.
 I ran  away from my lessons, and my work, and came to you, Peter, because I had  a feeling that there was something you could give me, and I thought you  would.
"    Peter smiled a slow curious smile.
    "I like your line of thought, Linda," he said quietly.
 "It greatly  appeals to me.
 Any time an ancient and patriarchal literary man named  Peter Morrison can serve as a rock upon which a young thing can rest,  why he'll be glad to be that rock.
"    "What were you doing?" asked Linda abruptly.
    "Come and see," said Peter.
    He led the way to the garage.
 His worktable and the cement floor around  it were littered with sheets of closely typed paper.
    "I'll have to assemble them first," said Peter, getting down on his  knees and beginning to pick them up.
    Linda sat on a packing case and watched him.
 Already she felt comforted.
  Of course Peter was a rock, of course anyone could trust him, and of  course if the tempest of life beat upon her too strongly she could  always fly to Peter.
    "May I?" she inquired, stretching her hand in the direction of a sheet.
    "Sure," said Peter.
    "What is it?" inquired Linda lightly.
 "The bridge or the road or the  playroom?"    "Gad!" he said slowly.
 "Don't talk about me being a rock! Rocks are  stolid, stodgy unresponsive things.
 I thought I was struggling with  one of the biggest political problems of the day from an economic and  psychological standpoint.
 If I'd had sense enough to realize that it  was a bridge I was building, I might have done the thing with some  imagination and subtlety.
 If you want a rock and you say I am a rock, a  rock I'll be, Linda.
 But I know what you are, and what you will be to me  when we really become the kind of friends we are destined to be.
"    "I wonder now," said Linda, "if you are going to say that I could be any  such lovely thing on the landscape as a bridge.
"    "No," said Peter slowly, "nothing so prosaic.
 Bridges are common in  this world.
 You are going to be something uncommon.
 History records  the experiences of but one man who has seen a flame in the open.
 I am a  second Moses and you are going to be my burning bush.
 I intended to read  this article to you.
"    Peter massed the sheets, straightened them on the desk, and deliberately  ripped them across several times.
 Linda sprang to her feet and stretched  out her hands.
    "Why, Peter!" she cried in a shocked voice.
 "That is perfectly  inexcusable.
 There are hours and hours of work on that, and I have not a  doubt but that it was good work.
"    "Simple case of mechanism," said Peter, reducing the bits to smaller  size and dropping them into the empty nail keg that served as his  wastebasket.
 "A lifeless thing without a soul, mere clockwork.
 I have  got the idea now.
 I am to build a bridge and make a road.
 Every way  I look I can see a golden-flame tongue of inspiration burning.
 I'll  rewrite that thing and animate it.
 Take me for a ride, Linda.
"    Linda rose and walked to the Bear Cat.
 Peter climbed in and sat beside  her.
 Linda laid her hands on the steering wheel and started the car.
 She  ran it down to the highway and chose a level road leading straight  down the valley through cultivated country.
 In all the world there was  nothing to equal the panorama that she spread before Peter that evening.
  She drove the Bear Cat past orchards, hundreds of acres of orchards  of waxen green leaves and waxen white bloom of orange, grapefruit, and  lemon.
 She took him where seas of pink outlined peach orchards, and  other seas the more delicate tint of the apricots.
 She glided down  avenues lined with palm and eucalyptus, pepper and olive, and through  unbroken rows, extending for miles, of roses, long stretches of white,  again a stretch of pink, then salmon, yellow, and red.
 Nowhere in all  the world are there to be found so many acres of orchard bloom and  so many miles of tree-lined, rose-decorated roadway as in southern  California.
 She sent the little car through the evening until she felt  that it was time to go home, and when at last she stopped where they had  started, she realized that neither she nor Peter had spoken one word.
 As  he stepped from the car she leaned toward him and reached out her hand.
    "Thank you for the fireplace, Peter," she said.
    Peter took the hand she extended and held it one minute in both his own.
  Then very gently he straightened it out in the palm of one of his hands  and with the other hand turned back the fingers and laid his lips to the  heart of it.
    "Thank you, Linda, for the flame," he said, and turning abruptly, he  went toward his workroom.
    Stopping for a bite to eat in the kitchen, Linda went back to her room.
  She sat down at the table and picking up her pencil, began to work, and  found that she could work.
 Every stroke came true and strong.
 Every idea  seemed original and unusual.
 Quite as late as a light ever had shone in  her window, it shone that night, the last thing she did being to  write another anonymous letter to Marian, and when she reread it Linda  realized that it was an appealing letter.
 She thought it certainly would  comfort Marian and surely would make her feel that someone worth while  was interested in her and in her work.
 She loved some of the whimsical  little touches she had put into it, and she wondered if she had made  it so much like Peter Morrison that it would be suggestive of him  to Marian.
 She knew that she had no right to do that and had no such  intention.
 She merely wanted a model to copy from and Peter seemed the  most appealing model at hand.
    After school the next day Linda reported that she had finished going  through the books and was ready to have them taken.
 Then, after a few  minutes of deep thought, she made her way to the Consolidated Bank.
 At  the window of the paying teller she explained that she wished to see  the person connected with the bank who had charge of the safety-deposit  boxes and who looked after the accounts pertaining to the estate of  Alexander Strong.
 The teller recognized the name.
 He immediately became  deferential.
    "I'll take you to the office of the president," he said.
 "He and Doctor  Strong were very warm friends.
 You can explain to him what it is you  want to know.
"    Before she realized what was happening, Linda found herself in an office  that was all mahogany and marble.
 At a huge desk stacked with papers sat  a man, considerably older than her father.
 Linda remembered to have seen  him frequently in their home, in her father's car, and she recalled one  fishing expedition to the Tulare Lake region where he had been a member  of her father's party.
    "Of course you have forgotten me, Mr. Worthington," she said as she  approached his desk.
 "I have grown such a tall person during the past  four years.
"    The white-haired financier rose and stretched out his hand.
    "You exact replica of Alexander Strong," he said laughingly, "I couldn't  forget you any more than I could forget your father.
 That fine fishing  trip where you proved such a grand little scout is bright in my memory  as one of my happiest vacations.
 Sit down and tell me what I can do for  you.
"    Linda sat down and told him that she was dissatisfied with the manner in  which her father's estate was being administered.
    He listened very carefully to all she had to say, then he pressed a  button and gave a few words of instruction to the clerk who answered  it.
 When several ledgers and account books were laid before him,  with practiced hand he turned to what he wanted.
 The records were not  complicated.
 They covered a period of four years.
 They showed exactly  what monies had been paid into the bank for the estate.
 They showed what  royalties had been paid on the books.
 Linda sat beside him and watched  his pencil running up and down columns, setting down a list of items,  and making everything plain.
 Paid cheques for household expenses I and  drygoods bills were all recorded and deducted.
 With narrow, alert eyes,  Linda was watching, and her brain was keenly alive.
 As she realized the  discrepancy between the annual revenue from the estate and the totaling  of the expenses, she had an inspiration.
 Something she never before had  thought of occurred to her.
 She looked the banker in the eye and said  very quietly: "And now, since she is my sister and I am going to be of  age very shortly and these things must all be gone into and opened up,  would it be out of place for me to ask you this afternoon to let me have  a glimpse at the private account of Miss Eileen Strong?"    The banker drew a deep breath and looked at Linda keenly.
    "That would not be customary," he said slowly.
    "No?" said Linda.
 "But since Father and Mother went out at the same time  and there was no will and the property would be legally divided equally  between us upon my coming of age, would my sister be entitled to a  private account?"    "Had she any sources of obtaining money outside the estate?"    "No," said Linda.
 "At least none that I know of.
 Mother had I some  relatives in San Francisco who were very wealthy people, but they never  came to see us and we never went there.
 I know nothing about them.
 I  never had any money from them and I am quite sure Eileen never had.
"    Linda sat very quietly a minute and then she looked at the banker.
    "Mr. Worthington," she said, "the situation is slightly peculiar.
 My  guardian, John Gilman, is engaged to marry my sister Eileen.
 She is a  beautiful girl, as you no doubt recall, and he is very much in love with  her.
 Undoubtedly she has been able, at least recently, to manage affairs  very much in her own way.
 She is more than four years my senior, and has  always had charge of the household accounts and the handling of the bank  accounts.
 Since there is such a wide discrepancy between the returns  from the property and the expenses that these books show, I am forced to  the conclusion that there must be upon your books, or the books of some  other bank in the city, a private account in Eileen's name or in the  name of the Strong estate.
"    "That I can very easily ascertain," said Mr. Worthington, reaching again  toward the button on his desk.
 A few minutes later the report came that  there was a private account in the name of Miss Eileen Strong.
 Again  Linda was deeply thoughtful.
    "Is there anything I can do," she inquired, "to prevent that account  from being changed or drawn out previous to my coming of age?"    Then Mr. Worthington grew thoughtful.
    "Yes," he said at last.
 "If you are dissatisfied, if you feel that you  have reason to believe that money rightfully belonging to you is being  diverted to other channels, you have the right to issue an injunction  against the bank, ordering it not to pay out any further money on  any account nor to honor any cheques drawn by Miss Strong until the  settlement of the estate.
 Ask your guardian to execute and deliver such  an injunction, or merely ask him, as your guardian and the administrator  of the estate, to give the bank a written order to that effect.
"    "But because he is engaged to Eileen, I told him I would not bring him  into this matter," said Linda.
 "I told him that I would do what I wanted  done, myself.
"    "Well, how long is it until this coming birthday of yours?" inquired Mr.  Worthington.
    "Less than two weeks," answered Linda.
    For a time the financier sat in deep thought, then he looked at Linda.
  It was a keen, searching look.
 It went to the depths of her eyes; it  included her face and hair; it included the folds of her dress, the cut  of her shoe, and rested attentively on the slender hands lying quietly  in her lap.
    "I see the circumstances very clearly," he said.
 "I sympathize with your  position.
 Having known your father and being well acquainted with your  guardian, would you be satisfied if I should take the responsibility of  issuing to the clerks an order not to allow anything to be drawn from  the private account until the settlement of the estate?"    "Perfectly satisfied," said Linda.
    "It might be," said Mr. Worthington, "managing matters i that way, that  no one outside of ourselves need ever know of il Should your sister not  draw on the private account in the mean time, she would be free to draw  household cheques on the monthly income and if in the settlement of the  estate she turns in this private account or accounts, she need never  know of the restriction concerning this fund.
"    "Thank you very much," said Linda.
 "That will fix everything finely.
"    On her way to the street car, Linda's brain whirled.
    "It's not conceivable," she said, "that Eileen should be enriching  herself at my expense.
 I can't imagine her being dishonest in money  affairs, and yet I can recall scarcely a circumstance in life in which  Eileen has ever hesitated to be dishonest when a lie served her purpose  better than the truth.
 Anyway, matters are safe now.
"    The next day the books were taken and a cheque for their value was  waiting for Linda when she reached home.
 She cashed this cheque and  went straight to Peter Morrison for his estimate of the expenses for the  skylight and fireplace.
 When she asked for the bill Peter hesitated.
    "You wouldn't accept this little addition to your study as a gift from  Henry and me?" he asked lightly.
 "It would be a great pleasure to us if  you would.
"    "I could accept stones that Henry Anderson had gathered from the  mountains and canyons, and I could accept a verse carved on stone, and  be delighted with the gift; but I couldn't accept hours of day labor  at the present price of labor, so you will have to give me the bill,  Peter.
"    Peter did not have the bill, but he had memoranda, and when Linda paid  him she reflected that the current talk concerning the inflated price of  labor was greatly exaggerated.
    For two evenings as Linda returned from school and went to her room she  glanced down the hall and smiled at the decoration remaining on Eileen's  rug.
 The third evening it was gone, so that she knew Eileen was either  in her room or had been there.
 She did not meet her sister until  dinnertime.
 She was prepared to watch Eileen, to study her closely.
 She  was not prepared to admire her, but in her heart she almost did that  very thing.
 Eileen had practiced subterfuges so long, she was so  accomplished, that it would have taken an expert to distinguish reality  from subterfuge.
 She entered the dining room humming a gay tune.
 She was  carefully dressed and appealingly beautiful.
 She blew a kiss to Linda  and waved gaily to Katy.
    "I was rather afraid," she said lightly, "that I might find you two in  mourning when I got back.
 I never stayed so long before, did I? Seemed  as if every friend I had made special demand on my time all at once.
  Hope you haven't been dull without me.
"    "Oh, no," said Linda quietly.
 "Being away at school all day, of course  I wouldn't know whether you were at home or not, and I have grown so  accustomed to spending my evenings alone that I don't rely on you for  entertainment at any time.
"    "In other words," said Eileen, "it doesn't make any difference to you  where I am.
"    "Not so far as enjoying your company is concerned," said Linda.
  "Otherwise, of course it makes a difference.
 I hope you had a happy  time.
"    "Oh, I always have a happy time," answered Eileen lightly.
 "I certainly  have the best friends.
"    "That's your good fortune," answered Linda.
    At the close of the meal Linda sat waiting.
 Eileen gave Katy  instructions to have things ready for a midnight lunch for her and John  Gilman and then, humming her tune again, she left the dining room and  went upstairs.
 Linda stood looking after her.
     "Now or never," she said at last.
  "I have no business to let  her meet John until I have recovered my self-respect.
 But the Lord help  me to do the thing decently!"    So she followed Eileen up the stairway.
 She tapped at the door, and  without waiting to hear whether she was invited or not, opened it and  stepped inside.
 Eileen was sitting before the window, a big box of candy  beside her, a magazine in her fingers.
    Evidently she intended to keep her temper in case the coming interview  threatened to become painful.
    "I was half expecting you," she said, "you silly hothead.
 I found the  cheque I wrote you when I got home this afternoon.
 That was a foolish  thing to do.
 Why did you tear it up? If it were too large or if it were  not enough why didn't you use it and ask for another? Because I had  to be away that was merely to leave you something to go on until I got  back.
"    Then Linda did the most disconcerting thing possible.
 In her effort at  self-control she went too far.
 She merely folded her hands in her lap  and sat looking straight at Eileen without saying one word.
 It did not  show much on the surface, but Eileen really had a conscience, she really  had a soul; Linda's eyes, resting rather speculatively on her, were  honest eyes, and Eileen knew what she knew.
 She flushed and fidgeted,  and at last she broke out impatiently: "Oh, for goodness' sake, Linda,  don't play 'Patience-on-a-monument.
' Speak up and say what it is that  you want.
 If that cheque was not big enough, what will satisfy you?"    "Come to think of it," said Linda quietly, "I can get along with what I  have for the short time until the legal settlement of our interests is  due.
 You needn't bother any more about a cheque.
"    Eileen was surprised and her face showed it; and she was also relieved.
  That too her face showed.
    "I always knew," she said lightly, "that I had a little sister with  a remarkably level head and good common sense.
 I am glad that you  recognize the awful inflation of prices during the war period, and how I  have had to skimp and scheme and save in order to make ends meet and to  keep us going on Papa's meager income.
"    All Linda's good resolutions vanished.
 She was under strong nervous  tension.
 It irritated her to have Eileen constantly referring to their  monetary affairs as if they were practically paupers, as if their  father's life had been a financial failure, as if he had not been able  to realize from achievements recognized around the world a comfortable  living for two women.
    "Oh, good Lord!" she said shortly.
 "Bluff the rest of the world like  a professional, Eileen, but why try it with me? You're right about my  having common sense.
 I'll admit that I am using it now.
 I will be of  age in a few days, and then we'll take John Gilman and go to the  Consolidated Bank, and if it suits your convenience to be absent for  four or five days at that period, I'll take John Gilman and we'll go  together.
"    Eileen was amazed.
 The receding color in her cheeks left the rouge on  them a ghastly, garish thing.
    "Well, I won't do anything of the sort," she said hotly, "and neither  will John Gilman.
"    "Unfortunately for you," answered Linda, "John Gilman is my guardian,  not yours.
 He'll be forced to do what the law says he must, and what  common decency tells him he must, no matter what his personal feelings  are; and I might as well tell you that your absence has done you no  good.
 You'd far better have come home, as you agreed to, and gone over  the books and made me a decent allowance, because in your absence John  came here to ask me where you were, and I know that he was anxious.
"    "He came here!" cried Eileen.
    "Why, yes," said Linda.
 "Was it anything unusual? Hasn't he been coming  here ever since I can remember? Evidently you didn't keep him as well  posted this time as you usually do.
 He came here and asked for me.
"    "And I suppose," said Eileen, an ugly red beginning to rush into her  white cheeks, "that you took pains to make things uncomfortable for me.
"    "I am very much afraid," said Linda, "that you are right.
 You have  made things uncomfortable for me ever since I can remember, for I can't  remember the time when you were not finding fault with me, putting me in  the wrong and getting me criticized and punished if you possibly could.
  It was a fair understanding that you should be here, and you were not,  and I was seeing red about it; and just as John came in I found your  note in the living room and read it aloud.
'    "Oh, well, there was nothing in that," said Eileen in a relieved tone.
    "Nothing in the wording of it, no," said Linda, "but there was  everything in the intention back of it.
 Because you did not live up to  your tacit agreement, and because I had been on high tension for two or  three days, I lost my temper completely.
 I brought John Gilman up here  and showed him the suite of rooms in which you have done for yourself,  for four years.
 I gave him rather a thorough inventory of your dressing  table and drawers, and then I opened the closet door and called his  attention to the number and the quality of the garments hanging there.
  The box underneath them I thought was a shoe box, but it didn't prove to  be exactly that; and for that I want to tell you, as I have already told  John, I am sorry.
 I wouldn't have done that if I had known what I was  doing.
"    "Is that all?" inquired Eileen, making a desperate effort at  self-control.
    "Not quite," said Linda.
 "When I finished with your room, I took him  back and showed him mine in even greater detail than I showed him yours.
  I thought the contrast would be more enlightening than anything either  one of us could say.
"    "And I suppose you realize," said Eileen bitterly, "that you lost me  John Gilman when you did it.
"    "I?" said Linda.
 "I lost you John Gilman when I did it? But I didn't  do it.
 You did it.
 You have been busy for four years doing it.
 If you  hadn't done it, it wouldn't have been there for me to show him.
 I can't  see that this is profitable.
 Certainly it's the most distressing thing  that ever has occurred for me.
 But I didn't feel that I could let you  meet John Gilman tonight without telling you what he knows.
 If you have  any way to square your conscience and cleanse your soul before you meet  him, you had better do it, for he's a mighty fine man and if you lose  him you will have lost the best chance that is likely ever to come to  you.
"    Linda sat studying Eileen.
 She saw the gallant effort she was making  to keep her self-possession, to think with her accustomed rapidity, to  strike upon some scheme whereby she could square herself.
 She rose and  started toward the door.
    "What you'll say to John I haven't the faintest notion," she said.
 "I  told him very little.
 I just showed him.
"    Then she went out and closed the door after her.
 At the foot of the  stairs she met Katy admitting Gilman.
 Without any preliminaries she  said: "I repeat, John, that I'm sorry for what happened the other day.
  I have just come from Eileen.
 She will be down as soon as Katy tells her  you're here, no doubt.
 I have done what I told you I would.
 She knows  what I showed you so you needn't employ any subterfuges.
 You can be  frank and honest with each other.
"    "I wish to God we could," said John Gilman.
    Linda went to her work.
 She decided that she would gauge what happened  by the length of time John stayed.
 If he remained only a few minutes it  would indicate that there had been a rupture.
 If he stayed as long as he  usually did, the chances were that Eileen's wit had triumphed as usual.
    At twelve o'clock Linda laid her pencils in the box, washed the brushes,  and went down the back stairs to the ice chest for a glass of milk.
 The  living room was still lighted and Linda thought Eileen's laugh quite  as gay as she ever had heard it.
 Linda closed her lips very tight and  slowly climbed the stairs.
 When she entered her room she walked up to  the mirror and stared at herself in the glass for a long time, and then  of herself she asked this question:    "Well, how do you suppose she did it?"        .
 Spanish Iris    Just as Linda was most deeply absorbed with her own concerns there came  a letter from Marian which Linda read and reread several times; for  Marian wrote:    MY DEAREST PAL:    Life is so busy up San Francisco way that it makes Lilac Valley look in  retrospection like a peaceful sunset preliminary to bed time.
    But I want you to have the consolation and the comfort of knowing that I  have found at least two friends that I hope will endure.
 One is a woman  who has a room across the hall from mine in my apartment house.
 She is  a newspaper woman and life is very full for her, but it is filled with  such intensely interesting things that I almost regret having made my  life work anything so prosaic as inanimate houses; but then it's my  dream to enliven each house I plan with at least the spirit of home.
  This woman--her name is Dana Meade--enlivens every hour of her working  day with something concerning the welfare of humanity.
 She is a  beautiful woman in her soul, so extremely beautiful that I can't at this  minute write you a detailed description of her hair and her eyes and her  complexion, because this nice, big, friendly light that radiates  from her so lights her up and transfigures her that everyone says how  beautiful she is, and yet I have a vague recollection that her nose is  what you would call a "beak," and I am afraid her cheek bones are too  high for good proportion, and I know that her hair is not always so  carefully dressed as it should be, but what is the difference when  the hair is crowned with a halo? I can't swear to any of these things;  they're sketchy impressions.
 The only thing I am absolutely sure about  is the inner light that shines to an unbelievable degree.
 I wish she  had more time and I wish I had more time and that she and I might become  such friends as you and I are.
 I can't tell you, dear, how much I think  of you.
 It seems to me that you're running a sort of undercurrent in my  thoughts all day long.
    You will hardly credit it, Linda, but a few days ago I drove a car  through the thickest traffic, up a steep hill, and round a curve.
 I did  it, but practically collapsed when it was over.
 The why of it was this:  I think I told you before that in the offices of Nicholson and Snow  there is a man who is an understanding person.
 He is the junior partner  and his name is Eugene Snow.
 I happened to arrive at his desk the day  I came for my instructions and to make my plans for entering their  contest.
 He was very kind to me and went out of his way to smooth out  the rough places.
 Ever since, he makes a point of coming to me and  talking a few minutes when I am at the office or when he passes me on my  way to the drafting rooms where I take my lessons.
 The day I mention I  had worked late and hard the night before.
 I had done the last possible  thing to the plans for my dream house.
 At the last minute, getting it  all on paper, working at the specifications, at which you know I am  wobbly, was nervous business; and when I came from the desk after having  turned in my plans, perhaps I showed fatigue.
 Anyway, he said to me that  his car was below.
 He said also that he was a lonely person, having lost  his wife two years ago, and not being able very frequently to see his  little daughter who is in the care of her grandmother, there were times  when he was hungry for the companionship he had lost.
 He asked me if I  would go with him for a drive and I told him that I would.
 I am rather  stunned yet over what happened.
 The runabout he led me to was greatly  like yours, and, Linda, he stopped at a florist's and came out with an  armload of bloom--exquisite lavender and pale pink and faint yellow and  waxen white--the most enticing armload of spring.
 For one minute I  truly experienced a thrill.
 I thought he was going to give that mass of  flowers to me, but he did not.
 He merely laid it across my lap and said:  "Edith adored the flowers from bulbs.
 I never see such bloom that my  heart does not ache with a keen, angry ache to think that she should be  taken from the world, and the beauty that she so loved, so early and so  ruthlessly.
 We'll take her these as I would take them to her were she  living.
"    So, Linda dear, I sat there and looked at color and drank in fragrance,  and we whirled through the city and away to a cemetery on a beautiful  hill, and filled a vase inside the gates of a mausoleum with these  appealing flowers.
 Then we sat down, and a man with a hurt heart told  me about his hurt, and what an effort he was making to get through the  world as the woman he loved would have had him; and before I knew what  I was doing, Linda, I told him the tellable part of my own hurts.
 I even  lifted my turban and bowed my white head before him.
 This hurt--it was  one of the inexorable things that come to people in this world--I could  talk about.
 That deeper hurt, which has put a scar that never will be  effaced on my soul, of course I could not tell him about.
 But when we  went back to the car he said to me that he would help me to get  back into the sunlight.
 He said the first thing I must do to regain  self-confidence was to begin driving again.
 I told him I could not, but  he said I must, and made me take the driver's seat of a car I had  never seen and take the steering wheel of a make of machine I had never  driven, and tackle two or three serious problems for a driver.
 I did it  all right, Linda, because I couldn't allow myself to fail the kind of a  man Mr. Snow is, when he was truly trying to help me, but in the depths  of my heart I am afraid I am a coward forever, for there is a ghastly  illness takes possession of me as I write these details to you.
 But  anyway, put a red mark on your calendar beside the date on which you  get this letter, and joyfully say to yourself that Marian has found two  real, sympathetic friends.
    In a week or ten days I shall know about the contest.
 If I win, as I  really have a sneaking hope that I shall, since I have condensed the  best of two dozen houses into one and exhausted my imagination on  my dream home, I will surely telegraph, and you can make it a day of  jubilee.
 If I fail, I will try to find out where my dream was not true  and what can be done to make it materialize properly; but between us,  Linda girl, I am going to be dreadfully disappointed.
 I could use the  material value that prize represents.
 I could start my life work which  I hope to do in Lilac Valley on the prestige and the background that it  would give me.
 I don't know, Linda, whether you ever learned to pray  or not, but I have, and it's a thing that helps when the black  shadow comes, when you reach the land of "benefits forgot and friends  remembered not.
"    And this reminds me that I should not write to my very dearest friend  who has her own problems and make her heart sad with mine; so to the  joyful news of my two friends add a third, Linda, for I am going to tell  you a secret because it will make you happy.
 Since I have been in San  Francisco some man, who for a reason of his own does not tell me his  name, has been writing me extremely attractive letters.
 I have had  several of them and I can't tell you, Linda, what they mean to me or  how they help me.
 There is a touch of whimsy about them.
 I can't as  yet connect them with anybody I ever met, but to me they are taking the  place of a little lunch on the bread of life.
 They are such real, such  vivid, such alive letters from such a real person that I have been  doing the very foolish and romantic thing of answering them as my heart  dictates and signing my own name to them, which on the surface looks  unwise when the man in the case keeps his identity in the background;  but since he knows me and knows my name it seems useless to do anything  else: and answer these letters I shall and must; because every one of  them is to me a strong light thrown on John Gilman.
 Every time one of  these letters comes to me I have the feeling that I would like to reach  out through space and pick up the man who is writing them and dangle him  before Eileen and say to her: "Take HIM.
 I dare you to take HIM.
" And my  confidence, Linda, is positively supreme that she could not do it.
    You know, between us, Linda, we regarded Eileen as a rare creature, a  kind of exotic thing, made to be kept in a glass house with tempered air  and warmed water; but as I go about the city and at times amuse myself  at concerts and theaters, I am rather dazed to tell you, honey, that  the world is chock full of Eileens.
 On the streets, in the stores,  everywhere I go, sometimes half a dozen times in a day I say to myself:  "There goes Eileen.
" I haven't a doubt that Eileen has a heart, if  it has not become so calloused that nobody could ever reach it, and I  suspect she has a soul, but the more I see of her kind the more I feel  that John Gilman may have to breast rather black water before he finds  them.
    With dearest love, be sure to remember me to Katherine O'Donovan.
 Hug  her tight and give her my unqualified love.
 Don't let her forget me.
    As ever,    MARIAN.
    This was the letter that Linda read once, then she read it again and  then she read it a third time, and after that she lost count and reread  it whenever she was not busy doing something else, for it was a letter  that was the next thing to laying hands upon Marian.
 The part of the  letter concerning the unknown man who was writing Marian, Linda pondered  over deeply.
    "That is the best thing I ever did in my life," she said in  self-commendation.
 "It's doing more than I hoped it would.
 It's giving  Marian something to think about.
 It's giving her an interest in life.
  It's distracting her attention.
 Without saying a word about John Gilman  it is making her see for herself the weak spots in him through the very  subtle method of calling her attention to the strength that may lie  in another man.
 For once in your life, Linda, you have done something  strictly worth while.
 The thing for you to do is to keep it up, and in  order to keep it up, to make each letter fresh and original, you will  have to do a good deal of sticking around Peter Morrison's location and  absorbing rather thoroughly the things he says.
 Peter doesn't know he is  writing those letters but he is in them till it's a wonder Marian does  not hear him drawl and see the imps twisting his lips as she reads them.
  Before I write another single one I'll go see Peter.
 Maybe he will have  that article written.
 I'll take a pencil, and as he reads I'll jot down  the salient points and then I'll come home and work out a head and tail  piece for him to send in with it, and in that way I'll ease my soul  about the skylight and the fireplace.
"    So Linda took pad and pencils, raided Katy for everything she could find  that was temptingly edible, climbed into the Bear Cat, and went to see  Peter as frankly as she would have crossed the lawn to visit Marian.
  He was not in the garage when she stopped her car before it, but the  workmen told her that he had strolled up the mountain and that probably  he would return soon.
 Learning that he had been gone but a short time  Linda set the Bear Cat squalling at the top of its voice.
 Then she took  possession of the garage, and clearing Peter's worktable spread upon it  the food she had brought, and then started out to find some flowers for  decorations.
 When Peter came upon the scene he found Linda, flushed and  brilliant eyed, holding before him a big bouquet of alder bloom, the  last of the lilacs she had found in a cool, shaded place, pink filaree,  blue lupin, and white mahogany panicles.
 "Peter," she cried.
 "you can't  guess what I have been doing!"    Peter glanced at the flowers.
    "Isn't it obvious?" he inquired.
    "No, it isn't," said Linda, "because I am capable of two processes at  once.
 The work of my hands is visible; with it I am going to decorate  your table.
 You won't have to go down to the restaurant for your supper  tonight because I have brought my supper up to share with you, and after  we finish, you're going to read me your article as you have rewritten  it.
 I am going to decorate it and we are going to make a hit with it  that will be at least a start on the road to greater fame.
 What you see  is material.
 You can pick it up, smell it, admire it and eat it.
 But  what I have truly been doing is setting Spanish iris for yards down one  side of the bed of your stream.
 When I left it was a foot and a half  high Peter, and every blue that the sky ever knew in its loveliest  moments, and a yellow that is the concentrated essence of the best gold  from the heart of California.
 Oh, Peter, there is enchantment in the way  I set it.
 There are irregular deep beds, and there are straggly places  where there are only one or two in a ragged streak, and then it runs  along the edge in a fringy rim, and then it stretches out in a marshy  place that is going to have some other wild things, arrowheads, and  orchids, and maybe a bunch of paint brush on a high, dry spot near by.
 I  wish you could see it!"    Peter looked at Linda reflectively and then he told her that he could  see it.
 He fold her that he adored it, that he was crazy about her  straggly continuity and her fringy border, but there was not one word of  truth in what he said, because what he saw was a slender thing, willowy,  graceful; roughened wavy black hair hanging half her length in heavy  braids, dark eyes and bright cheeks, a vivid red line of mouth, and  a bright brown line of freckles bridging a prominent and aristocratic  nose.
 What he was seeing was a soul, a young thing, a thing he coveted  with every nerve and fiber of his being.
 And while he glibly humored her  in her vision of decorating his brook, in his own consciousness he was  saying to himself: "Is there any reason why I should not try for her?"    And then he answered himself.
 "There is no reason in your life.
 There  is nothing ugly that could offend her or hurt her.
 The reason, the real  reason, probably lies in the fact that if she were thinking of caring  for anyone it would be for that attractive young schoolmate she brought  up here for me to exercise my wits upon.
 It is very likely that she  regards me in the light of a grandfatherly person to whom she can come  with her joys or her problems, as frankly as she has now.
"    So Peter asked if the irises crossed the brook and ran down both sides.
  Linda sat on a packing case and concentrated on the iris, and finally  she announced that they did.
 She informed him that his place was going  to be natural, that Nature evolved things in her own way.
 She did not  grow irises down one side of a brook and arrowheads down the other.
  They waded across and flew across and visited back and forth, riding  the water or the wind or the down of a bee or the tail of a cow.
 As she  served the supper she had brought she very gravely informed him that  there would be iris on both sides of his brook, and cress and miners'  lettuce under the bridge; and she knew exactly where the wild clematis  grew that would whiten his embankment after his workmen had extracted  the last root of poison oak.
    "It may not scorch you, Peter," she said gravely, "but you must look out  for the Missus and the little things.
 I haven't definitely decided on  her yet, but she looks a good deal like Mary Louise Whiting to mc.
 I saw  her the other day.
 She came to school after Donald.
 I liked her looks  so well that I said to myself: 'Everybody talks about how fine she is.
  I shouldn't wonder if I had better save her for Peter'; but if I decide  to, you should act that poison stuff out, because it's sure as shooting  to attack any one with the soft, delicate skin that goes with a golden  head.
"    "Oh, let's leave it in," said Peter, "and dispense with the golden head.
  By the time you get that stream planted as you're planning, I'll have  become so accustomed to a dark head bobbing up and down beside it that  I won't take kindly to a sorrel top.
" "That is positively sacrilegious,"  said Linda, lifting her hands to her rough black hair.
 "Never in my life  saw anything lovelier than the rich gold on Louise Whiting's bare head  as she bent to release her brakes and start her car.
 A black head looks  like a cinder bed beside it; and only think what a sunburst it will be  when Mary Louise kneels down beside the iris.
"    When they had finished their supper Linda gathered up the remnants and  put them in the car, then she laid a notebook and pencil on the table.
    "Now I want to hear that article," she said.
 "I knew you would do it  over the minute I was gone, and I knew you would keep it to read to me  before you sent it.
"    "Hm," said Peter.
 "Is it second sight or psychoanalysis or telepathy, or  what?"    "Mostly 'what'," laughed Linda.
 "I merely knew.
 The workmen are gone and  everything is quiet now, Peter.
 Begin.
 I am crazy to get the particular  angle from which you 'make the world safe for democracy.
' John used to  call our attention to your articles during the war.
 He said we had  not sent another man to France who could write as humanely and as  interestingly as you did.
 I wish I had kept those articles; because I  didn't get anything from them to compare with what I can get since I  have a slight acquaintance with the procession that marches around  your mouth.
 Peter, you will have to watch that mouth of yours.
 It's an  awfully betraying feature.
 So long as it's occupied with politics  and the fads and the foibles and the sins and the foolishness and the  extravagances of humanity, it's all very well.
 But if you ever get  in trouble or if ever your heart hurts, or you get mad enough to kill  somebody, that mouth of yours is going to be a most awfully revealing  feature, Peter.
 You will have hard work to settle it down into  hard-and-fast noncommittal lines.
"    Peter looked at the girl steadily.
    "Have you specialized on my mouth?" he asked.
    "Huh-umph!" said Linda, shaking her head vigorously.
 "When I specialize I  use a pin and a microscope and go right to the root of matters as I was  taught.
 This is superficial.
 I am extemporizing now.
"    "Well, if this is extemporizing," said Peter, "God help my soul if you  ever go at me with a pin and a microscope.
"    "Oh, but I won't!" cried Linda.
 "It wouldn't be kind to pin your friends  on a setting board and use a microscope on them.
 You might see things  that were strictly private.
 You might see things they wouldn't want you  to see.
 They might not be your friends any more if you did that.
 When  I make a friend I just take him on trust like I did Donald.
 You're my  friend, aren't you, Peter?"    "Yes, Linda," said Peter soberly.
 "Put me to any test you can think of  if you want proof.
"    "But I don't believe in PROVING friends, either," said Linda.
 "I believe  in nurturing them.
 I would set a friend in my garden and water his feet  and turn the sunshine on him and tell him to stay there and grow.
 I  might fertilize him, I might prune him, and I might use insecticide on  him.
 I might spray him with rather stringent solutions, but I give you  my word I would not test him.
 If he flourished under my care I would  know it, and if he did not I would know it, and that would be all I  would want to know.
 I have watched Daddy search for the seat of  nervous disorders, and sometimes he had to probe very deep to find what  developed nerves unduly but he didn't ever do any picking and raveling  and fringing at the soul of a human being merely for the sake of finding  out what it was made of; and everyone says I am like him.
"    "I wish I might have known him," said Peter.
    "Don't I wish it!" said Linda.
 "Now then, Peter, go ahead.
 Read your  article.
"    Peter opened a packing case, picked out a sheaf of papers, and sitting  opposite Linda, began to read.
 He was dumbfounded to find that he, a man  who had read and talked extemporaneously before great bodies of learned  men, should have cold feet and shaking hands and a hammering heart  because he was trying to read an article on America for Americans before  a high-school Junior.
 But presently, as the theme engrossed him, he  forgot the vision of Linda interesting herself in his homemaking, and  saw instead a vision of his country threatened on one side by the red  menace of the Bolshevik, on the other by the yellow menace of the  Jap, and yet on another by the treachery of the Mexican and the slowly  uprising might of the black man, and presently he was thundering his  best-considered arguments at Linda until she imperceptibly drew back  from him on the packing case, and with parted lips and wide eyes she  listened in utter absorption.
 She gazed at a transformed Peter with  aroused eyes and a white light of patriotism on his forehead, and a  conception even keener than anything that the war had brought her young  soul was burning in her heart of what a man means when he tries to  express his feeling concerning the land of his birth.
 Presently, without  realizing what she was doing, she reached for her pad and pencils and  rapidly began sketching a stretch of peaceful countryside over which  a coming storm of gigantic proportions was gathering.
 Fired by Peter's  article, the touch of genius in Linda's soul became creative and she  fashioned huge storm clouds wind driven, that floated in such a manner  as to bring the merest suggestion of menacing faces, black faces,  yellow faces, brown faces, and under the flash of lightning, just at the  obscuring of the sun, a huge, evil, leering red face.
 She swept a stroke  across her sheet and below this she began again, sketching the same  stretch of country she had pictured above, strolling in cultivated  fields, dotting it with white cities, connecting it with smooth  roadways, sweeping the sky with giant planes.
 At one side, winging in  from the glow of morning, she drew in the strong-winged flight of a  flock of sea swallows, peacefully homing toward the far-distant ocean.
  She was utterly unaware when Peter stopped reading.
 Absorbed, she bent  over her work.
 When she had finished she looked up.
    "Now I'll take this home," she said.
 "I can't do well on color  with pencils.
 You hold that article till I have time to put this on  water-color paper and touch it up a bit here and there, and I believe it  will be worthy of starting and closing your article.
"    She pushed the sketches toward him.
    "You little wonder!" said Peter softly.
    "Yes, 'little' is good," scoffed Linda, rising to very nearly his height  and reaching for the lunch basket.
 "'Little' is good, Peter.
 If I could  do what I like to myself I would get in some kind of a press and squash  down about seven inches.
"    "Oh, Lord!" said Peter.
 "Forget it.
 What's the difference what the  inches of your body are so long as your brain has a stature worthy of  mention?"    "Good-bye!" said Linda.
 "On the strength of that I'll jazz that sketch  all up, bluey and red-purple and jade-green.
 I'll make it as glorious as  a Catalina sunset.
"    As she swung the car around the sharp curve at the boulders she looked  back and laughingly waved her hand at Peter, and Peter experienced a  wild desire to shriek lest she lose control of the car and plunge down  the steep incline.
 A second later, when he saw her securely on the road  below, he smiled to himself.
    "Proves one thing," he said conclusively.
 "She is over the horrors.
  She is driving unconsciously.
 Thank God she knew that curve so well she  could look the other way and drive it mentally.
"        .
 The Official Bug-Catcher    Not a mile below the exit from Peter's grounds, Linda perceived a  heavily laden person toiling down the roadway before her and when she  ran her car abreast and stopped it, Henry Anderson looked up at her with  joyful face.
    "Sorry I can't uncover, fair lady," he said, "but you see I am very much  otherwise engaged.
"    What Linda saw was a tired, disheveled man standing in the roadway  beside her car, under each arm a boulder the size of her head, one  almost jet-black, shot through with lines of white and flying figures  of white crossing between these bands that almost reminded one of winged  dancers.
 The other was a combination stone made up of matrix thickly  imbedded with pebbles of brown, green, pink, and dull blue.
    "For pity's sake!" said Linda.
 "Where are you going and why are you  personally demonstrating a new method of transporting rock?"    "I am on my way down Lilac Valley to the residence of a friend of mine,"  said Henry Anderson.
 "I heard her say the other day that she saved  every peculiarly marked boulder she could find to preserve coolness and  moisture in her fern bed.
"    Linda leaned over and opened the car door.
    "All well and good," she said; "but why in the cause of reason didn't  you leave them at Peter's and bring them down in his car?"    Henry Anderson laid the stones in the bottom of the car, stepped in and  closed the door behind him.
 He drew a handkerchief from his pocket and  wiped his perspiring face and soiled hands.
    "I had two sufficient personal reasons," he said.
 "One was that the car  at our place is Peter Morrison's car, not mine; and the other was that  it's none of anybody's business but my own if I choose to 'say it' with  stones.
"    Linda started the car, being liberal with gas--so liberal that it was  only a few minutes till Henry Anderson protested.
    "This isn't the speedway," he said.
 "What's your hurry?"    "Two reasons seem to be all that are allowed for things at the present  minute," answered Linda.
 "One of mine is that you can't drive this beast  slow, and the other is that my workroom is piled high with things I  should be doing.
 I have two sketches I must complete while I am in the  mood, and I have had a great big letter from my friend, Marian Thorne,  today that I want to answer before I go to bed tonight.
"    "In other words," said Henry Anderson bluntly, "you want me to  understand that when I have reached your place and dumped these stones I  can beat it; you have no further use for me.
"    "You said that," retorted Linda.
    "And who ever heard of such a thing," said Henry, "as a young woman  sending away a person of my numerous charms and attractions in order to  work, or to write a letter to another woman?"    "But you're not taking into consideration," said Linda, "that I must  work, and I scarcely know you, while I have known Marian ever since I  was four years old and she is my best friend.
"    "Well, she has no advantage over me," said Henry instantly, "because I  have known you quite as long as Peter Morrison has at least, and I'm  your official bug-catcher.
"    "I had almost forgotten about the bugs," said Linda.
    "Well, don't for a minute think I am going to give you an opportunity to  forget," said Henry Anderson.
    He reached across and laid his hand over Linda's on the steering gear.
  Linda said nothing, neither did she move.
 She merely added more gas and  put the Bear Cat forward at a dizzy whirl.
 Henry laughed.
    "That's all right, my beauty," he said.
 "Don't you think for a minute  that I can't ride as fast as you can drive.
"    A dull red mottled Linda's cheeks.
 As quickly as it could be done she  brought the Bear Cat to a full stop.
 Then she turned and looked at Henry  Anderson.
 The expression in her eyes was disconcerting even to that  cheeky young individual--he had not borne her gaze a second until he  removed his hand.
    "Thanks," said Linda in a dry drawl.
 "And you will add to my obligation  if in the future you will remember not to deal in assumptions.
 I am not  your 'beauty,' and I'm not anyone's beauty; while the only thing in this  world that I am interested in at present is to get the best education I  can and at the same time carry on work that I love to do.
 I have a year  to finish my course in the high school and when I finish I will only  have a good beginning for whatever I decide to study next.
"    "That's nothing," said the irrepressible Henry.
 "It will take me two  years to catch a sufficient number of gold bugs to be really serious,  but there wouldn't be any harm in having a mutual understanding and  something definite to work for, and then we might be able, you know, to  cut out some of that year of high-school grinding.
 If the plans I have  submitted in the Nicholson and Snow contest should just happen to be the  prize winners, that would put matters in such a shape for young Henry  that he could devote himself to crickets and tumble-bugs at once.
"    "Don't you think," said Linda quietly, "that you would better forget  that silly jesting and concentrate the best of your brains on improving  your plans for Peter Morrison's house?"    "Why, surely I will if that's what you command me to do," said Henry,  purposely misunderstanding her.
    "You haven't mentioned before," said Linda, "that you had submitted  plans in that San Francisco contest.
"    "All done and gone," said Henry Anderson lightly.
 "I had an inspiration  one day and I saw a way to improve a house with comforts and  conveniences I never had thought of before.
 I was enthusiastic over the  production when I got it on paper and figured it.
 It's exactly the house  that I am going to build for Peter, and when I've cut my eye teeth on it  I am going to correct everything possible and build it in perfection for  you.
"    "Look here," said Linda soberly, "I'm not accustomed to this sort of  talk.
 I don't care for it.
 If you want to preserve even the semblance of  friendship with me you must stop it, and get to impersonal matters and  stay there.
"    "All right," he agreed instantly, "but if you don't like my line of  talk, you're the first girl I ever met that didn't.
"    "You have my sympathy," said Linda gravely.
 "You have been extremely  unfortunate.
"    Then she started the Bear Cat, and again running at undue speed she  reached her wild-flower garden.
 Henry Anderson placed the stones as she  directed and waited for an invitation to come in, but the invitation  was not given.
 Linda thanked him for the stones.
 She told him that in  combination with a few remaining from the mantel they would make all she  would require, and excusing herself she drove to the garage.
 When she  came in she found the irrepressible Henry sitting on the back steps  explaining to Katy the strenuous time he had had finding and carrying  down the stones they had brought.
 Katy had a plate of refreshments ready  to hand him when Linda laughingly passed them and went to her room.
    When she had finished her letter to Marian she took a sheet of drawing  paper, and in her most attractive lettering sketched in the heading, "A  Palate Teaser," which was a direct quotation from Katy.
 Below she wrote:    You will find Tunas in the cacti thickets of any desert, but if you are  so fortunate as to be able to reach specimens which were brought from  Mexico and set as hedges around the gardens of the old missions, you  will find there the material for this salad in its most luscious form.
  Naturally it can be made from either Opuntia Fiscus-Indica or Opuntia  Tuna, but a combination of these two gives the salad an exquisite  appearance and a tiny touch more delicious flavor, because Tuna, which  is red, has to my taste a trifle richer and fuller flavor than Indica,  which is yellow.
 Both fruits taste more like the best well-ripened  watermelon than any other I recall.
    Bring down the Tunas with a fishing rod or a long pole with a nail in  the end.
 With anything save your fingers roll them in the sand or in  tufts of grass to remove the spines.
 Slice off either end, score the  skin down one side, press lightly, and a lush globule of pale gold or  rosy red fruit larger than a hen's egg lies before you.
 With a sharp  knife, beginning with a layer of red and ending with one of yellow,  slice the fruits thinly, stopping to shake out the seeds as you work.
 In  case you live in San Diego County or farther south, where it is possible  to secure the scarlet berries of the Strawberry Cactus--it is the  Mammillaria Goodridgei species that you should use--a beautiful  decoration for finishing your salad can be made from the red  strawberries of these.
 If you live too far north to find these, you  may send your salad to the table beautifully decorated by cutting fancy  figures from the red Tuna, or by slicing it lengthwise into oblong  pieces and weaving them into a decoration over the yellow background.
    For your dressing use the juice of a lemon mixed with that of an  orange, sweetened to taste, into which you work, a drop at a time, four  tablespoons of the best Palermo olive oil.
 If the salad is large more  oil and more juice should be used.
    To get the full deliciousness of this salad, the fruit must have been  on ice, and the dressing made in a bowl imbedded in cracked ice, so that  when ready to blend both are ice-cold, and must be served immediately.
    Gigantic specimens of fruit-bearing Cacti can be found all over the  Sunland Desert near to the city, but they are not possessed of the full  flavor of the cultivated old mission growths, so that it is well worth  your while to make a trip to the nearest of these for the fruit with  which to prepare this salad.
 And if, as you gather it, you should see  a vision of a white head, a thin, ascetic, old face, a lean figure  trailing a brown robe, slender white hands clasping a heavy cross;  if you should hear the music of worship ascending from the throats of  Benedictine fathers leading a clamoring choir of the blended voices of  Spaniard, Mexican, and Indian, combining with the music of the bells and  the songs of the mocking birds, nest making among the Tunas, it will be  good for your soul in the line of purging it from selfishness, since in  this day we are not asked to give all of life to the service of others,  only a reasonable part of it.
    Linda read this over, working in changes here and there, then she picked  up her pencil and across the top of her sheet indicated an open sky  with scarcely a hint of cloud.
 Across the bottom she outlined a bit  of Sunland Desert she well remembered, in the foreground a bed of  flat-leaved nopal, flowering red and yellow, the dark red prickly pears,  edible, being a near relative of the fruits she had used in her salad.
  After giving the prickly pear the place of honor to the left, in higher  growth she worked in the slender, cylindrical, jointed stems of the  Cholla, shading the flowers a paler, greenish yellow.
 On the right,  balancing the Cholla, she drew the oval, cylindrical columns of the  hedgehog cactus, and the color touch of the big magenta flowers blended  exquisitely with the color she already had used.
 At the left, the length  of her page, she drew a gigantic specimen of Opuntia Tuna, covered with  flowers, and well-developed specimens of the pears whose coloring ran  into the shades of the hedgehog cactus.
    She was putting away her working materials when she heard steps and  voices on the stairs, so she knew that Eileen and John Gilman were  coming.
 She did not in the least want them, yet she could think of no  excuse for refusing them admission that would not seem ungracious.
 She  hurried to the wall, snatched down the paintings for Peter Morrison, and  looked around to see how she could dispose of them.
 She ended by laying  one of them in a large drawer which she pushed shut and locked.
 The  other she placed inside a case in the wall which formerly had been used  for billiard cues.
 At their second tap she opened the door.
 Eileen  was not at her best.
 There was a worried look across her eyes, a  restlessness visible in her movements, but Gilman was radiant.
    "What do you think, Linda?" he cried.
 "Eileen has just named the day!"    "I did no such thing," broke in Eileen.
    "Your pardon, fair lady, you did not," said Gilman.
 "That was merely a  figure of speech.
 I meant named the month.
 She has definitely promised  in October, and I may begin to hunt a location and plan a home for us.
 I  want the congratulations of my dear friend and my dearer sister.
"    Linda held out her hand and smiled as bravely as she could.
    "I am very glad you are so pleased, John," she said quietly, "and I hope  that you will be as happy as you deserve to be.
"    "Now exactly what do you mean by that?" he asked.
    "Oh, Linda prides herself on being deep and subtle and conveying hidden  meanings," said Eileen.
 "She means what a thousand people will tell you  in the coming months: merely that they hope you will be happy.
"    "Of course," Linda hastened to corroborate, wishing if possible to avoid  any unpleasantness.
    "You certainly have an attractive workroom here," said John, "much as I  hate to see it spoiled for billiards.
"    "It's too bad," said Linda, "that I have spoiled it for you for  billiards.
 I have also spoiled the outside appearance of the house for  Eileen.
"    "Oh, I don't know," said John.
 "I looked at it carefully the other  day as I came up, and I thought your changes enhanced the value of the  property.
"    "I am surely glad to hear that," said Linda.
 "Take a look through my  skylight and my new window.
 Imagine you see the rugs I am going to have  and a few more pieces of furniture when I can afford them; and let me  particularly point out the fireplace that Henry Anderson and your friend  Peter designed and had built for me.
 Doesn't it add a soul and a heart  to my study?"    John Gilman walked over and looked at the fireplace critically.
 He read  the lines aloud, then he turned to Eileen.
    "Why, that is perfectly beautiful," he said.
 "Let's duplicate it in our  home.
"    "You bungler!" scoffed Eileen.
    "I think you're right," said Gilman reflectively, "exactly right.
 Of  course I would have no business copying Linda's special fireplace where  the same people would see it frequently; and if I had stopped to think a  second, I might have known that you would prefer tiling to field stone.
"    "Linda seems very busy tonight," said Eileen.
 "Perhaps we are bothering  her.
"    "Yes," said John, "we'll go at once.
 I had to run up to tell our good  news; and I wanted to tell you too, Linda dear, that I think both of us  misjudged Eileen the other day.
 You know, Linda, you have always dressed  according to your father's ideas, which were so much simpler and plainer  than the manner in which your mother dressed Eileen, that she merely  thought that you wished to continue in his way.
 She had no objection to  your having any kind of clothes you chose, if only you had confided in  her, and explained to her what you wanted.
"    Linda stood beside her table, one lean hand holding down the letter she  had been writing.
 She stood very still, but she was powerless to raise  her eyes to the face of either John or Eileen.
 Above everything she did  not wish to go any further in revealing Eileen to John Gilman.
 If he  knew what he knew and if he felt satisfied, after what he had seen, with  any explanation that Eileen could trump up to offer, Linda had no desire  to carry the matter further.
 She had been ashamed of what she already  had done.
 She had felt angry and dissatisfied with herself, so she stood  before them downcast and silent.
    "And it certainly was a great joke on both of us," said John jovially,  "what we thought about that box of cigarettes, you know.
 They were a  prize given by a bridge club at an 'Ambassador' benefit for the Good  Samaritan Hospital.
 Eileen, the little card shark she is, won it, and  she was keeping it hidden away there to use as a gift for my birthday.
  Since we disclosed her plans prematurely, she gave it to me at once, and  I'm having a great time treating all my friends.
"    At that instant Linda experienced a revulsion.
 Previously she had not  been able to raise her eyes.
 Now it would have been quite impossible to  avoid looking straight into Eileen's face.
 But Eileen had no intention  of meeting anyone's gaze at that minute.
 She was fidgeting with a sheet  of drawing paper.
    "Careful you don't bend that," cautioned Linda.
 Then she looked at  John Gilman.
 He BELIEVED what he was saying; he was happy again.
 Linda  evolved the best smile she could.
    "How stupid of us not to have guessed!" she said.
    Closing the door behind them, Linda leaned against it and looked up  through the skylight at the creep blue of the night, the low-hung stars.
  How long she stood there she did not know.
 Presently she went to her  chair, picked up her pencil, and slowly began to draw.
 At first she  scarcely realized what she was doing, then she became absorbed in  her work.
 Then she reached for her color box and brushes, and shortly  afterward tacked against the wall an extremely clever drawing of a  greatly enlarged wasp.
 Skillfully she had sketched a face that was  recognizable round the big insect eyes.
 She had surmounted the face by  a fluff of bejewelled yellow curls, encased the hind legs upon which the  creature stood upright in pink velvet Turkish trousers and put tiny gold  shoes on the feet.
 She greatly exaggerated the wings into long trails  and made them of green gauze with ruffled edges.
 All the remainder of  the legs she had transformed into so many braceleted arms, each holding  a tiny fan, or a necklace, a jewel box, or a handkerchief of lace.
 She  stood before this sketch, studying it for a few minutes, then she walked  over to the table and came back with a big black pencil.
 Steadying her  hand with a mahl stick rested against the wall, with one short sharp  stroke she drew a needle-pointed stinger, so screened by the delicate  wings that it could not be seen unless you scrutinized the picture  minutely.
 After that, with careful, interested hands she brought out  Peter Morrison's drawings and replaced them on the wall to dry.
        .
 The Cap Sheaf    Toward the last of the week Linda began to clear the mental decks of her  ship of life in order that she might have Saturday free for her promised  day with Donald.
 She had decided that they would devote that day to  wave-beaten Laguna.
 It was a long drive but delightful.
 It ran over the  old King's Highway between miles of orange and lemon orchards in full  flower, bordered by other miles of roses in their prime.
    Every minute when her mind was not actively occupied with her lessons  or her recipes Linda was dreaming of the King's Highway.
 Almost  unconsciously she began to chant:    "All in the golden weather, forth let us ride today, You and I together  on the King's Highway, The blue skies above us, and below the shining  sea; There's many a road to travel, but it's this road for me.
"    You must have ridden this road with an understanding heart and the  arm of God around you to know the exact degree of disappointment that  swelled in Linda's heart when she answered the telephone early Saturday  morning and heard Donald Whiting's strained voice speaking into it.
 He  was talking breathlessly in eager, boyish fashion.
    "Linda, I am in a garage halfway downtown," he was saying, "and it looks  to me as if to save my soul I couldn't reach you before noon.
 I have had  the darnedest luck.
 Our Jap got sick last week and he sent a new man  to take his place.
 There wasn't a thing the matter with our car when  I drove it in Friday night.
 This morning Father wanted to use it on  important business, and it wouldn't run.
 He ordered me to tinker it  up enough to get it to the shop.
 I went at it and when it would go,  I started You can imagine the clip I was going, and the thing went to  pieces.
 I don't know yet how it comes that I saved my skin.
 I'm pretty  badly knocked out, but I'll get there by noon if it's a possible thing.
"    "Oh, that's all right," said Linda, fervently hoping that the ache in  her throat would not tincture her voice.
    It was half-past eleven when Donald came.
 Linda could not bring herself  to give up the sea that day.
 She found it impossible to drive the King's  Highway.
 It seemed equally impossible not to look on the face of the  ocean, so she compromised by skirting Santa Monica Bay, and taking the  foothill road she ran it to the north end of the beach drive.
 When they  had spread their blankets on the sand, finished their lunch and were  resting, Linda began to question Donald about what had happened.
 She  wanted to know how long Whitings' gardener had been in their employ;  if they knew where he lived and about his family; if they knew who his  friends were, or anything concerning him.
 She inquired about the man  who had taken his place, and wanted most particularly to know what the  garage men had found the trouble with a car that ran perfectly on  Friday night and broke down in half a dozen different places on Saturday  morning.
 Finally Donald looked at her, laughingly quizzical.
    "Linda," he said, "you're no nerve specialist and no naturalist.
 You're  the cross examiner for the plaintiff.
 What are you trying to get at?  Make out a case against Yogo Sani?"    "Of course it's all right," said Linda, watching a distant pelican turn  head down and catapult into the sea.
 "It has to be all right, but you  must admit that it looks peculiar.
 How have you been getting along this  week?"    Donald waved his hand in the direction of a formation of stone the size  of a small house.
    "Been rolling that to the top of the mountain," he said lightly.
 Linda's  eyes narrowed, her face grew speculative.
 She looked at Donald intently.
    "Is it as difficult as that?" she asked in a lowered voice as if the  surf and the sea chickens might hear.
    "It is just as difficult as that," said Donald.
 "While you're talking  about peculiar things, I'll tell you one.
 In class I came right up  against Oka Sayye on the solution of a theorem in trigonometry.
 We both  had the answer, the correct answer, but we had arrived at it by widely  different routes, and it was up to me to prove that my line of reasoning  was more lucid, more natural, the inevitable one by which the solution  should be reached.
 We got so in earnest that I am afraid both of us were  rather tense.
 I stepped over to his demonstration to point out where I  thought his reasoning was wrong.
 I got closer to the Jap than I had ever  been before; and by gracious, Linda! scattered, but nevertheless still  there, and visible, I saw a sprinkling of gray hairs just in front of  and over his ears.
 It caught me unawares, and before I knew what I was  doing, before the professor and the assembled classroom I blurted it  out: 'Say, Oka Sayye, how old are you?' If the Jap had had any way of  killing me, I believe he would have done it.
 There was a look in his  eyes that was what I would call deadly.
 It was only a flash and then,  very courteously, putting me in the wrong, of course, he remarked that  he was 'almost ninekleen'; and it struck me from his look and the way he  said it that it was a lie.
 If he truly was the average age of the rest  of the class there was nothing for him to be angry about.
 Then I did  take a deliberate survey.
 From the settled solidity of his frame and the  shape of his hands and the skin of his face and the set of his eyes in  his head, I couldn't see that much youth.
 I'll bet he's thirty if he's a  day, and I shouldn't be a bit surprised if he has graduated at the most  worthwhile university in Japan, before he ever came to this country to  get his English for nothing.
"    Linda was watching a sea swallow now, and slowly her lean fingers were  gathering handfuls of sand and sifting them into a little pyramid she  was heaping beside her.
 Again almost under her breath she spoke.
    "Donald, do you really believe that?" she asked.
 "Is it possible that  mature Jap men are coming here and entering our schools and availing  themselves of the benefits that the taxpayers of California provide for  their children?"    "Didn't you know it?" asked Donald.
 "I hadn't thought of it in  connection with Oka Sayye, but I do know cases where mature Japs have  been in grade schools with children under ten.
"    "Oh, Donald!" exclaimed Linda.
 "If California is permitting that or ever  has permitted it, we're too easy.
 We deserve to become their prey if we  are so careless.
"    "Why, I know it's true," said Donald.
 "I have been in the same classes  with men more than old enough to be my father.
"    "I never was," said Linda, industriously sifting sand.
 "I have been  in classes with Japs ever since I have been at school, but it was with  girls and boys of our gardeners and fruit dealers and curio-shop people,  and they were always of my age and entitled to be in school, since our  system includes the education of anybody who happens to be in California  and wants to go to school.
"    "Did my being late spoil any particular plan you had made, Linda?"    "Yes," said Linda, "it did.
"    "Oh, I am so sorry!" cried Donald.
 "I certainly shall try to see that it  doesn't occur again.
 Could we do it next Saturday?"    "I am hoping so," said Linda.
    "I told Dad," said Donald, "where I wanted to go and what I wanted to  do, and he was awfully sorry but he said it was business and it would  take only a few minutes and he thought I could do it and be on time.
 If  he had known I would be detained I don't believe he would have asked it  of me.
 He's a grand old peter, Linda.
"        "Yes, I know," said Linda.
 "There's not much you can tell me about  peters of the grand sort, the real, true flesh-and-blood, bighearted,  human-being fathers, who will take you to the fields and the woods and  take the time to teach you what God made and how He made it and why  He made it and what we can do with it, and of the fellowship and  brotherhood we can get from Nature by being real kin.
 The one thing that  I have had that was the biggest thing in all this world was one of these  real fathers.
"    Donald watched as she raised the pyramid higher and higher.
    "Did you tell your father whom you were to go with?" she asked.
    "Sure I did," said Donald.
 "Told the whole family at dinner last night.
  Told 'em about all the things I was learning, from where to get soap  off the bushes to the best spot for material for wooden legs or  instantaneous relief for snake bite.
"    "What did they say?" Linda inquired laughingly.
    "Unanimously in favour of continuing the course," he said.
 "I had  already told Father about you when I asked him for books and any help  that he could give me with Oka Sayye.
 Since I had mentioned you last  night he told Mother and Louise about that, and they told me to bring  you to the house some time.
 All of them are crazy to know you.
 Mother  says she is just wild to know whether a girl who wears boots and  breeches and who knows canyons and the desert and the mountains as you  do can be a feminine and lovable person.
"    "If I told her how many friends I have, she could have speedily decided  whether I am lovable or not," said Linda; "but I would make an effort to  convince her that I am strictly feminine.
"    "You would convince her of that without making the slightest effort.
  You're infinitely more feminine than any other girl I have ever known.
"    "How do you figure that?" asked Linda.
    "Well," said Donald, "it's a queer thing about you, Linda.
 I take  any liberty I pretty nearly please with most of the girls I have been  associated with.
 I tie their shoes and pull their hair--down if I want  to--and hand them round 'most any way the notion takes me, and they just  laugh and take the same liberties with me, which proves that I am pretty  much a girl with them or they are pretty much boys with me.
 But it  wouldn't occur to me to touch your hair or your shoe lace or the tips of  your fingers; which proves that you're more feminine than any other  girl I know, because if you were not I would be treating you more like  another boy.
 I thought, the first day we were together, that you were  like a boy, and I said so, and I thought it because you did not tease me  and flirt with me, but since I have come to know you better, you're less  like a boy than any other girl I ever have known.
"    "Don't get psychological, Donald," said Linda.
 "Go on with the Jap.
 I  haven't got an answer yet to what I really want to know.
 Have you made  the least progress this week? Can you beat him?"    Donald hesitated, studying over the answer.
    "Beat him at that trig proposition the other day," he said.
 "Got an  open commendation before the class.
 There's not a professor in any of my  classes who isn't 'hep' to what I'm after by this time, and if I would  cajole them a little they would naturally be on my side, especially if  their attention were called to that incident of yesterday; but you said  I have to beat him with my brains, by doing better work than he does; so  about the biggest thing I can honestly tell you is that I have held my  own.
 I have only been ahead of him once this week, but I haven't failed  in anything that he has accomplished.
 I have been able to put some  additional touches to some work that he has done for which he used to be  marked A which means your One Hundred.
 Double A which means your plus  I made in one instance.
 And you needn't think that Oka Sayye does not  realize what I am up to as well as any of the rest of the class, and you  needn't think that he is not going to give me a run for my brain.
 All  I've got will be needed before we finish this term.
"    "I see," said Linda, slowly nodding her head.
    "I wish," said Donald, "that we had started this thing two years ago, or  better still, four.
 But of course you were not in the high school four  years ago and there wasn't a girl in my class or among my friends who  cared whether I beat the Jap or not.
 They greatly preferred that I take  them motoring or to a dance or a picture show or a beach party.
 You're  the only one except Mother and Louise who ever inspired me to get down  to business.
"    Linda laid her palm on the top of the sand heap and pressed it flat.
 She  looked at Donald with laughing eyes.
    "Symbolical," she announced.
 "That sand was the Jap.
" She stretched her  hand toward him.
 "That was you.
 Did you see yourself squash him?"    Donald's laugh was grim.
    "Yes, I saw," he said.
 "I wish it were as easy as that.
"    "That was not easy," said Linda; "make a mental computation of all the  seconds that it took me to erect that pyramid and all the millions of  grains of sand I had to gather.
"    Donald was deeply thoughtful, yet a half smile was playing round his  lips.
    "Of all the queer girls I ever knew, you're the cap sheaf, Linda," he  said.
    Linda rose slowly, shook the sand from her breeches and stretched out  her hand.
    "Let's hotfoot it down to the African village and see what the movies  are doing that is interesting today," she proposed.
        .
 Shifting the Responsibility    On her pillow that night before dropping to almost instantaneous sleep  Linda reflected that if you could not ride the King's Highway, racing  the sands of Santa Monica was a very excellent substitute.
 It had been  a wonderful day after all.
 When she had left Donald at the Lilac Valley  end of the car line he had held her hand tight an instant and looked  into her face with the most engaging of clear, boyish smiles.
    "Linda, isn't our friendship the nicest thing that ever happened to us?"  he demanded.
    "Yes," answered Linda promptly, "quite the nicest.
 Make your plans for  all day long next Saturday.
"    "I'll be here before the birds are awake," promised Donald.
    At the close of Monday's sessions, going down the broad walk from the  high school, Donald overtook Linda and in a breathless whisper he said:  "What do you think? I came near Oka Sayye again this morning in trig,  and his hair was as black as jet, dyed to a midnight, charcoal finish,  and I am not right sure that he had not borrowed some girl's lipstick  and rouge pot for the benefit of his lips and cheeks.
 Positively he's  hectically youthful today.
 What do you know about that?"    Then he hurried on to overtake the crowd of boys he had left, Linda's  heart was racing in her breast.
    Turning, she re-entered the school building, and taking a telephone  directory she hunted an address, and then, instead of going to the  car line that took her to Lilac Valley she went to the address she had  looked up.
 With a pencil she wrote a few lines on a bit of scratch paper  in one of her books.
 That note opened a door and admitted her to the  presence of a tall, lean, gray-haired man with quick, blue-gray eyes and  lips that seemed capable of being either grave or gay on short notice.
  With that perfect ease which Linda had acquired through the young days  of her life in meeting friends of her father, she went to the table  beside which this man was standing and stretched out her hand.
    "Judge Whiting?" she asked.
    "Yes," said the Judge.
    "I am Linda Strong, the younger daughter of Alexander Strong.
 I think  you knew my father.
"    "Yes," said the Judge, "I knew him very well indeed, and I have some  small acquaintance with his daughter through very interesting reports  that my son brings home.
"    "Yes, it is about Donald that I came to see you," said Linda.
    If she had been watching as her father would have watched, Linda would  have seen the slight uplift of the Judge's figure, the tensing of his  muscles, the narrowing of his eyes in the swift, speculative look he  passed over her from the crown of her bare, roughened black head down  the gold-brown of her dress to her slender, well-shod feet.
 The last  part of that glance Linda caught.
 She slightly lifted one of the feet  under inspection, thrust it forward and looked at the Judge with a gay  challenge in her dark eyes.
    "Are you interested in them too?" she asked.
    The Judge was embarrassed.
 A flush crept into his cheeks.
 He was  supposed to be master of any emergency that might arise, but one had  arisen in connection with a slip of a schoolgirl that left him wordless.
    "It is very probable," said Linda, "that if my shoes had been like  most other girls' shoes I wouldn't be here today.
 I was in the same  schoolroom with your son for three years, and he never saw me or spoke  to me until one day he stopped me to inquire why I wore the kind of  shoes I did.
 He said he had a battle to wage with me because I tried to  be a law to myself, and he wanted to know why I wasn't like other girls.
  And I told him I had a crow to pick with HIM because he had the kind of  brain that would be content to let a Jap beat him in his own school,  in his own language and in his own country; so we made an engagement to  fight to a finish, and it ended by his becoming the only boy friend I  have and the nicest boy friend a girl ever had, I am very sure.
 That's  why I'm here.
"    Linda lifted her eyes and Judge Whiting looked into them till he saw the  same gold lights in their depths that Peter Morrison had seen.
 He came  around the table and placed a big leather chair for Linda.
 Then he went  back and resumed his own.
    "Of course," said the Judge in his most engaging manner.
 "I gather from  what Donald has told me that you have a reason for being here, and I  want you to understand that I am intensely interested in anything you  have to say to me.
 Now tell me why you came.
"    "I came," said Linda, "because I started something and am afraid of the  possible result.
 I think very likely if, in retaliation for what Donald  said to me about my hair and my shoes, I had not twitted him about the  use he was making of his brain and done everything in my power to drive  him into competition with Oka Sayye in the hope that a white man would  graduate with the highest honors, he would not have gone into this  competition, which I am now certain has antagonized Oka Sayye.
"    Linda folded her slim hands on the table and leaned forward.
    "Judge Whiting," she said earnestly, "I know very little about men.
 The  most I know was what I learned about my father and the men with whom he  occasionally hunted and fished.
 They were all such fine men that I must  have grown up thinking that every man was very like them, but one day I  came in direct contact with the Jap that Donald is trying to beat, and  the thing I saw in his face put fear into my heart and it has been there  ever since.
 I have almost an unreasoning fear of that Jap, not because  he has said anything or done anything.
 It's just instinctive.
 I may be  wholly wrong in having come to you and in taking up your time, but there  are two things I wanted to tell you.
 I could have told Donald, but if  I did and his mind went off at a tangent thinking of these things he  wouldn't be nearly so likely to be in condition to give his best thought  to his studies.
 If I really made him see what I think I have seen,  and fear what I know I fear, he might fail where I would give almost  anything to see him succeed; so I thought I would come to you and tell  you about it and ask you please to think it over, and to take extra care  of him, because I really believe that he may be in danger; and if he is  I never shall be able to rid myself of a sense of responsibility.
"    "I see," said Judge Whiting.
 "Now tell me, just as explicitly as you  have told me this, exactly what it is that you fear.
"    "Last Saturday," said Linda, "Donald told me that while standing at the  board beside Oka Sayye, demonstrating a theorem, he noticed that there  were gray hairs above the Jap's ears, and he bluntly asked him, before  the professor and the class, how old he was.
 In telling me, he said he  had the feeling that if the Jap could have done so in that instant, he  would have killed him.
 He said he was nineteen, but Donald says from the  matured lines of his body, from his hands and his face and his hair,  he is certain that he is thirty or more, and he thinks it very probable  that he may have graduated at home before he came here to get his  English for nothing from our public schools.
 I never before had the fact  called to my attention that this was being done, but Donald told me that  he had been in classes with matured men when he was less than ten years  of age.
 That is not fair, Judge Whiting; it is not right.
 There should  be an age specified above which people may not be allowed to attend  public school.
"    "I quite agree with you," said the Judge.
 "That has been done in the  grades, but there is nothing fair in bringing a boy under twenty in  competition with a man graduated from the institutions of another  country, even in the high schools.
 If this be the case--"    "You can be certain that it is," said Linda, "because Donald whispered  to me as he passed me half an hour ago, coming from the school building,  that TODAY Oka Sayye's hair is a uniform, shining black, and he  also thought that he had used a lipstick and rouge in an effort at  rejuvenation.
 Do you think, from your knowledge of Donald, that he would  imagine that?"    "No," said Judge Whiting, "I don't think such a thing would occur to him  unless he saw it.
"    "Neither do I," said Linda.
 "From the short acquaintance I have with him  I should not call him at all imaginative, but he is extremely quick and  wonderfully retentive.
 You have to show him but once from which cactus  he can get Victrola needles and fishing hooks, or where to find material  for wooden legs.
"    The Judge laughed.
 "Doesn't prove much," he said.
 "You wouldn't have  to show me that more than once either.
 If anyone were giving me an  intensive course on such interesting subjects, I would guarantee to  remember, even at my age.
"    Linda nodded in acquiescence.
 "Then you can regard it as quite certain,"  she said, "that Oka Sayye is making up in an effort to appear younger  than he is which means that he doesn't want his right questioned to be  in our schools, to absorb the things that we are taught, to learn our  language, our government, our institutions, our ideals, our approximate  strength and our only-too-apparent weakness.
"    The Judge leaned forward and waited attentively.
    "The other matter," said Linda, "was relative to Saturday.
 There may not  be a thing in it, but sometimes a woman's intuition proves truer than  what a man thinks he sees and knows.
 I haven't SEEN a thing, and I don't  KNOW a thing, but I don't believe your gardener was sick last week.
  I believe he had a dirty job he wanted done and preferred to save his  position and avoid risks by getting some other Jap who had no family  and no interests here, to do it for him.
 I don't BELIEVE that your car,  having run all right Friday night, was shot to pieces Saturday morning  so that Donald went smash with it in a manner that might very easily  have killed him, or sent him to the hospital for months, while Oka Sayye  carried off the honors without competition I want to ask you to find out  whether your regular gardener truly was ill, whether he has a family and  interests to protect here, or whether he is a man who could disappear in  a night as Japs who have leased land and have families cannot.
 I want  to know about the man who took your gardener's place, and I want the man  who is repairing your car interviewed very carefully as to what he found  the trouble with it.
"    Linda paused.
 Judge Whiting sat in deep thought, then he looked at  Linda.
    "I see," he said at last.
 "Thank you very much for coming to me.
 All  these things and anything that develops from them shall be handled  carefully.
 Of course you know that Donald is my only son and you can  realize what he is to me and to his mother and sister.
"    "It is because I do realize that," said Linda, "that I am here.
 I  appreciate his friendship, but it is not for my own interests that I am  asking to have him taken care of while he wages his mental war with this  Jap.
 I want Donald to have the victory, but I want it to be a victory  that will be an inspiration to any boy of white blood among any of our  allies or among peoples who should be our allies.
 There's a showdown  coming between the white race and a mighty aggregation of colored  peoples one of these days, and if the white man doesn't realize pretty  soon that his supremacy is not only going to be contested but may be  lost, it just simply will be lost; that is all there is to it.
"    The Judge was studying deeply now.
 Finally he said: "Young lady, I  greatly appreciate your coming to me.
 There may be NOTHING in what you  fear.
 It MIGHT be a matter of national importance.
 In any event, it  shows that your heart is in the right place.
 May Mrs. Whiting and I pay  you a visit some day soon in your home?"    "Of course," said Linda simply.
 "I told Donald to bring his mother the  first time he came, but he said he did not need to be chaperoned when he  came to see me, because my father's name was a guarantee to his mother  that my home would be a proper place for him to visit.
"    "I wonder how many of his other girl friends invited him to bring his  mother to see them," said the Judge.
    "Oh, he probably grew up with the other girls and was acquainted with  them from tiny things," said Linda.
    "Very likely," conceded the Judge.
 "I think, after all, I would rather  have an invitation to make one of those trips with you to the desert or  the mountains.
 Is there anything else as interesting as fish hooks and  Victrola needles and wooden legs to be learned?"    "Oh, yes," said Linda, leaning farther forward, a lovely color sweeping  up into her cheeks, her eyes a-shine.
 She had missed the fact that the  Judge was jesting.
 She had thought him in sober, scientific earnest.
    "It's an awfully nice thing if you dig a plant or soil your hands in  hunting, or anything like that, to know that there are four or five  different kinds of vegetable soap where you can easily reach them, if  you know them.
 If you lose your way or have a long tramp, it's good to  know which plants will give you drink and where they are.
 And if you're  short of implements, you might at any time need a mescal stick, or an  arrow shaft or an arrow, even.
 If Donald were lost now, he could keep  alive for days, because he would know what wood would make him a bow and  how he could take amole fiber and braid a bow string and where he could  make arrows and arrow points so that he could shoot game for food.
 I've  taught him to make a number of snares, and he knows where to find and  how to cook his greens and potatoes and onions and where to find his  pickles and how to make lemonade and tea, and what to use for snake  bite.
 It's been such fun, Judge Whiting, and he has been so interested.
"    "Yes, I should think he would be," said the Judge.
 "I am interested  myself.
 If you would take an old boy like me on a few of those trips, I  would be immensely pleased.
"    "You'd like brigand beefsteak," suggested Linda, "and you'd like cress  salad, and I am sure you'd like creamed yucca.
"    "Hm," said the Judge.
 "Sounds to me like Jane Meredith.
"    Linda suddenly sat straight.
 A dazed expression crossed her face.
  Presently she recovered.
    "Will you kindly tell me," she said, "what a great criminal judge knows  about Jane Meredith?"    "Why, I hear my wife and daughter talking about her," said the Judge.
    "I wonder," said Linda, "if a judge hears so many secrets that he  forgets what a secret is and couldn't possibly keep one to save his  life.
"    "On the other hand," said Judge Whiting, "a judge hears so many secrets  that he learns to be a very secretive person himself, and if a young  lady just your size and so like you in every way as to be you, told me  anything and told me that it was a secret, I would guarantee to carry it  with me to my grave, if I said I would.
"    One of Linda's special laughs floated out of the windows.
 Her right hand  slipped across the table toward the Judge.
    "Cross your heart and body?" she challenged.
    The Judge took the hand she offered in both of his own.
    "On my soul," he said, "I swear it.
"    "All right," bubbled Linda.
 "Judge Whiting, allow me to present to  you Jane Meredith, the author and originator of the Aboriginal Cookery  articles now running in Everybody's Home.
"    Linda stood up as she made the presentation and the Judge arose with  her.
 When she bowed her dark head before him the Judge bowed equally as  low, then he took the hand he held and pressed it against his lips.
    "I am not surprised," he said.
 "I am honored, deeply honored, and I am  delighted.
 For a high school girl that is a splendid achievement.
"    "But you realize, of course," said Linda, "that it is vicarious.
 I  really haven't done anything.
 I am just passing on to the world what  Alexander Strong found it interesting to teach his daughter, because he  hadn't a son.
"    "I certainly am fortunate that my son is getting the benefit of this,"  said Judge Whiting earnestly.
 "There are girls who make my old-fashioned  soul shudder, but I shall rest in great comfort whenever I know that my  boy is with you.
"    "Sure!" laughed Linda.
 "I'm not vamping him.
 I don't know the first  principles.
 We're not doing a thing worse than sucking 'hunters' rock  leek' or roasting Indian potatoes or fishing for trout with cactus  spines.
 I have had such a lovely time I don't believe that I'll  apologize for coming.
 But you won't waste a minute in making sure about  Oka Sayye?"    "I won't waste a minute," said the Judge.
        .
 The End of Marian's Contest    Coming from school a few days later on an evening when she had been  detained, Linda found a radiant Katy awaiting her.
    "What's up, old dear?" cried Linda.
 "You seem positively illumined.
"    "So be," said Katy.
 "It's a good time I'm havin'.
 In the first place the  previous boss of this place ain't nowise so bossy as sue used to be, an'  livin' with her is a dale aisier.
 An' then, when Miss Eileen is around  these days, she is beginning to see things, and she is just black with  jealousy of ye.
 Something funny happened here the afternoon, an' she  was home for once an' got the full benefit of it.
 I was swapin' the aist  walk, but I know she was inside the window an' I know she heard.
 First,  comes a great big loaded automobile drivin' up, and stopped in front  with a flourish an' out hops as nice an' nate a lookin' lad as ever you  clapped your eyes on, an' up he comes to me an' off goes his hat with a  swape, an' he hands me that bundle an' he says: 'Here's something Miss  Linda is wantin' bad for her wild garden.
'"    Katy handed Linda a bundle of newspaper, inside which, wrapped in a  man's handkerchief, she found several plants, carefully lifted, the  roots properly balled, the heads erect, crisp, although in full flower.
    "Oh, Katy!" cried Linda.
 "Look, it's Gallito, 'little rooster'!" "Now  ain't them jist yellow violets?" asked Katy dubiously.
    "No," said Linda, "they are not.
 They are quite a bit rarer.
 They are  really a wild pansy.
 Bring water, Katy, and help me.
"    "But I've something else for ye," said Katy.
    "I don't care what you have," answered Linda.
 "I am just compelled to  park these little roosters at once.
"    "What makes ye call them that ungodly name?" asked Katy.
    "Nothing ungodly about it," answered Linda.
 "It's funny.
 Gallito is the  Spanish name for these violets, and it means 'little rooster.
'"    Linda set the violets as carefully as they had been lifted and rinsed  her hands at the hydrant.
    "Now bring on the remainder of the exhibit," she ordered.
    "It's there on the top of the rock pile, which you notice has incrased  since ye last saw it.
"    "So it has!" said Linda.
 "So it has! And beautifully colored specimens  those are too.
 My fern bed will lift up its voice and rejoice in them.
  And rocks mean Henry Anderson.
 The box I do not understand.
"    Linda picked it up, untied the string, and slipped off the wrapping.
  Katy stared in wide-mouthed amazement.
    "I was just tickled over that because Miss Eileen saw a good-looking and  capable young man leave a second package, right on the heels of young  Whiting," she said.
 "Whatever have ye got, lambie? What does that mean?"    Linda held up a beautiful box of glass, inside of which could be seen  swarming specimens of every bug, beetle, insect, and worm that Henry  Anderson had been able to collect in Heaven only knew what hours of  search.
 Linda opened the box.
 The winged creatures flew, the bettles  tumbled, the worms went over the top.
 She set it on the ground and  laughed to exhaustion.
 Her eyes were wet as she looked up at Katy.
    "That first night Henry Anderson and Peter Morrison were here to dinner,  Katy," she said, "Anderson made a joke about being my bug-catcher when  I built my home nest, and several times since he has tried to be silly  about it, but the last time I told him it was foolishness to which I  would listen no more, so instead of talking, he has taken this way of  telling me that he is fairly expert as a bug-catcher.
 Really, it is  awfully funny, Katy.
"    Katy was sober.
 She showed no appreciation of the fun.
    "Ye know, lambie," she said, her hands on her hips, her elbows  wide-spread, her jaws argumentative, "I've done some blarneying with  that lad, an' I've fed him some, because he was doin' things that would  help an' please ye, but now I'm tellin' ye, just like I'll be tellin' ye  till I die, I ain't STRONG for him.
 If ever the day comes when ye ask me  to take on that Whiting kid for me boss, I'll bow my head an' I'll fly  at his bidding, because he is real, he's goin' to come out a man lots  like your pa, or hisn.
 An' if ever the day comes when ye will be telling  me ye want me to serve Pater Morrison, I'll well nigh get on my knees  to him.
 I think he'd be the closest we'd ever come to gettin' the master  back.
 But I couldn't say I'd ever take to Anderson.
 They's something  about him, I can't just say what, but he puts me back up amazin'.
"    "Don't worry, ancient custodian of the family," said Linda.
 "That same  something in Henry Anderson that antagonizes you, affects me in even  stronger degree.
 You must not get the foolish notion that any man has a  speculative eye on me, because it is not true.
 Donald Whiting is only a  boy friend, treating me as a brother would, and Peter Morrison is much  too sophisticated and mature to pay any serious attention to a girl  with a year more high school before her.
 I want to be decent to Henry  Anderson, because he is Peter's architect, and I'm deeply interested in  Peter's house and the lady who will live in it.
 Sometimes I hope it will  be Donald's sister, Mary Louise.
 Anyway, I am going to get acquainted  with her and make it my business to see that she and Peter get their  chance to know each other well.
 My job for Peter is to help run his  brook at the proper angle, build his bridge, engineer his road, and  plant his grounds; so don't be dreaming any foolish dreams, Katy.
"    Katy folded her arms, tilted her chin at an unusually aspiring angle,  and deliberately sniffed.
    "Don't ye be lettin' yourself belave your own foolishness," she said.
 "I  ain't done with me exhibit yet.
 On the hall table ye will find a package  from the Pater Morrison man that Miss Eileen had the joy of takin'  in and layin' aside for ye, an atop of it rists a big letter that I'm  thinkin' might mean Miss Marian.
"    "Oh," cried Linda.
 "Why are you wasting all this time? If there is a  letter from Marian it may mean that the competition is decided; but if  it is, she loses, because she was to telegraph if she won.
"    Linda rushed into the house and carried her belongings to her workroom.
  She dropped them on the table and looked at them.
    "I'll get you off my mind first," she said to the Morrison package,  which enclosed a new article entitled "How to Grow Good Citizens.
" With  it was a scrawled line, "I'm leaving the head and heels of the future to  you.
"    "How fine!" exulted Linda.
 "He must have liked the head and tail pieces  I drew for his other article, so he wants the same for this, and if he  is well paid for his article, maybe in time, after I've settled for my  hearth motto, he will pay me something for my work.
 Gal-lum-shus!"    As she opened the letter from Marian she slowly shook her head.
    "Drat the luck," she muttered, "no good news here.
"    Slowly and absorbedly she read:    DEAREST LINDA:    No telegram to send.
 I grazed the first prize and missed the second  because Henry Anderson wins with plans so like mine that they are  practically duplicates.
 I have not seen the winning plans.
 Mr. Snow told  me as gently as he could that the judges had ruled me out entirely.
 The  winning plans are practically a reversal of mine, more professionally  drawn, and no doubt the specifications are far ahead of mine, as these  are my weak spot, although I have worked all day and far into the night  on the mathematics of house building.
 Mr. Snow was very kind, and  terribly cut up about it.
 I made what I hope was a brave fight, I did so  believe in those plans that I am afraid to say just how greatly  disappointed I am.
 All I can do is to go to work again and try to find  out how to better my best, which I surely put into the plans I  submitted.
 I can't see how Henry Anderson came to hit upon some of my  personal designs for comforts and conveniences.
 I had hoped that no man  would think of my especial kitchen plans.
 I rather fancied myself as a  benefactor to my sex, an emancipator from drudgery, as it were.
 I had a  concealed feeling that it required a woman who had expended her strength  combating the construction of a devilish kitchen, to devise some of my  built-in conveniences, and I worked as carefully on my kitchen table, as  on any part of the house.
 If I find later that the winning plans include  these things I shall believe that Henry Anderson is a mind reader, or  that lost plans naturally gravitate to him.
 But there is no use to  grouch further.
 I seem to be born a loser.
 Anyway, I haven't lost you  and I still have Dana Meade.
    I have nothing else to tell you except that Mr. Snow has waited for me  two evenings out of the week ever since I wrote you, and he has taken  me in his car and simply forced me to drive him for an hour over what  appeals to me to be the most difficult roads he could select.
 So far  I have not balked at anything but he has had the consideration not to  direct me to the mountains.
 He is extremely attractive, Linda, and I do  enjoy being with him, but I dread it too, because his grief is so deep  and so apparent that it constantly keeps before me the loss of my own  dear ones, and those things to which the hymn books refer as "aching  voids" in my own life.
    But there is something you will be glad to hear.
 That unknown  correspondent of mine is still sending letters, and I am crazy about  them.
 I don't answer one now until I have mulled over it two or three  days and I try to give him as good as he sends.
    I judge from your letters that you are keeping at least even with  Eileen, and that life is much happier for you.
 You seem to be  broadening.
 I am so glad for the friendship you have formed with Donald  Whiting.
 My mother and Mrs. Whiting were friends.
 She is a charming  woman and it has seemed to me that in her daughter Louise she has  managed a happy compound of old-fashioned straightforwardness and  unswerving principle, festooned with happy trimmings of all that is best  in the present days.
 I hope that you do become acquainted with her.
 She  is older than you, but she is the kind of girl I know you would like.
    Don't worry because I have lost again, Linda dear.
 Today is my blue  day.
 Tomorrow I shall roll up my sleeves and go at it again with all my  might, and by and by it is written in the books that things will come  right for me.
 They cannot go wrong for ever.
 With dearest love,    MARIAN.
    Linda looked grim as she finished the letter.
    "Confound such luck," she said emphatically.
 "I do not understand  it.
 How can a man like Henry Anderson know more about comforts and  conveniences in a home than a woman with Marian's experience and  comprehension? And she has been gaining experience for the past ten  years.
 That partner of his must be a six-cylinder miracle.
"    Linda went to the kitchen, because she was in pressing need of someone  to whom to tell her troubles, and there was no one except Katy.
 What  Katy said was energetic and emphatic, but it comforted Linda, because  she agreed with it and what she was seeking at the minute was someone  who agreed with her.
 As she went back upstairs, she met Eileen on her  way to the front door.
 Eileen paused and deliberately studied Linda's  face, and Linda stopped and waited quietly until she chose to speak.
    "I presume," said Eileen at last, "that you and Katy would call the  process through which you are going right now, 'taking the bit in your  teeth,' or some poetic thing like that, but I can't see that you are  getting much out of it.
 I don't hear the old laugh or the clatter of  gay feet as I did before all this war of dissatisfaction broke out.
 This  minute if you haven't either cried, or wanted to, I miss my guess.
"    "You win," said Linda.
 "I have not cried, because I make it a rule never  to resort to tears when I can help it; so what you see now is unshed  tears in my heart.
 They in no way relate to what you so aptly term my  'war of dissatisfaction'; they are for Marian.
 She has lost again, this  time the Nicholson and Snow prize in architecture.
"    "Serves her right," said Eileen, laughing contemptuously.
 "The  ridiculous idea of her trying to compete in a man's age-old occupation!  As if she ever could learn enough about joists and beams and girders and  installing water and gas and electricity to build a house.
 She should  have had the sense to know she couldn't do it.
"    "But," said Linda quietly, "Marian wasn't proposing to be a contractor,  she only wants to be an architect.
 And the man who beat her is Peter  Morrison's architect, Henry Anderson, and he won by such a narrow margin  that her plans were thrown out of second and third place, because they  were so very similar to his.
 Doesn't that strike you as curious?"    "That is more than curious," said Eileen slowly.
 "That is a very strange  coincidence.
 They couldn't have had anything from each other, because  they only met at dinner, before all of us, and Marian went away the next  morning; it does seem queer.
" Then she added with a flash of generosity  and justice, "It looks pretty good for Marian, at that.
 If she came so  near winning that she lost second and third because she was too near  first to make any practical difference, I must be wrong and she must be  right.
"    "You are wrong," said Linda tersely, "if you think Marian cannot  make wonderful plans for houses.
 But going back to what my 'war of  dissatisfaction' is doing to me, it's a pale affair compared with what  it is doing to you, Eileen.
 You look a debilitated silhouette of the  near recent past.
 Do you feel that badly about giving up a little money  and authority?"    "I never professed to have the slightest authority over you," said  Eileen very primly, as she drew back in the shadows.
 "You have come and  gone exactly as you pleased.
 All I ever tried to do was to keep up a  decent appearance before the neighbors and make financial ends meet.
"    "That never seemed to wear on you as something seems to do now," said  Linda.
 "I am thankful that this week ends it.
 I was looking for you  because I wanted to tell you to be sure not to make any date that  will keep you from meeting me at the office of the president of the  Consolidated Bank Thursday afternoon.
 I am going to arrange with John  to be there and it shouldn't take fifteen minutes to run through matters  and divide the income in a fair way between us.
 I am willing for you to  go on paying the bills and ordering for the house as you have been.
"    "Certainly you are," sneered Eileen.
 "You are quite willing for all the  work and use the greater part of my time to make you comfortable.
"    Linda suddenly drew back.
 Her body seemed to recoil, but her head thrust  forward as if to bring her eyes in better range to read Eileen's face.
    "That is utterly unjust, Eileen," she cried.
    Then two at a time she rushed the stairs in a race for her room.
        .
 The Day of Jubilee    Linda started to school half an hour earlier Wednesday morning because  that was the day for her weekly trip to the Post Office for any mail  which might have come to her under the name of Jane Meredith.
 She had  hard work to keep down her color when she recognized the heavy gray  envelope used by the editor of Everybody's Home.
 As she turned from the  window with it in her fingers she was trembling slightly and wondering  whether she could have a minute's seclusion to face the answer which her  last letter might have brought.
 There was a small alcove beside a public  desk at one side of the room.
 Linda stepped into this, tore open the  envelope and slipped out the sheet it contained.
 Dazedly she stared at  the slip that fell from it.
 Slowly the color left her cheeks and then  came rushing back from her surcharged heart until her very ears were  red, because that slip was very manifestly a cheque for five hundred  dollars.
 Mentally and physically Linda shook herself, then she  straightened to full height, tensing her muscles and holding the sheet  before her with a hand on each side to keep it from shaking, while she  read:    MY DEAR MADAM:    I sincerely apologize for having waited so long before writing you of  the very exceptional reception which your articles have had.
 I think one  half their attraction has been the exquisite and appealing pictures you  have sent for their illustration.
 At the present minute they are forming  what I consider the most unique feature in the magazine.
 I am enclosing  you a cheque for five hundred dollars as an initial payment on the  series.
 Just what the completed series should be worth I am unable to  say until you inform me how many months you can keep it up at the same  grade of culinary and literary interest and attractive illustration; but  I should say at a rough estimate that you would be safe in counting upon  a repetition of this cheque for every three articles you send in.
 This  of course includes payment for the pictures also, which are to me if  anything more attractive than the recipes, since the local color and  environment they add to the recipe and the word sketch are valuable in  the extreme.
    If you feel that you can continue this to the extent of even a small  volume, I shall be delighted to send you a book contract.
 In considering  this proposition, let me say that if you could not produce enough  recipes to fill a book, you could piece it out to the necessary length  most charmingly and attractively by lengthening the descriptions of the  environment in which the particular fruits and vegetables you deal with  are to be found; and in book form you might allow yourself much greater  latitude in the instructions concerning the handling of the fruits  and the preparation of the recipes.
 I think myself that a wonderfully  attractive book could be made from this material, and hope that you will  agree with me.
 Trusting that this will be satisfactory to you and that  you will seriously consider the book proposition before you decline it,  I remain, my dear madam, Very truly yours,    HUGH THOMPSON,    Editor, Everybody's Home.
    Gripping the cheque and the letter, Linda lurched forward against the  window casement and shut her eyes tight, because she could feel big,  nervous gulps of exultation and rejoicing swelling up in her throat.
 She  shifted the papers to one hand and surreptitiously slipped the other to  her pocket.
 She tried to keep the papers before her and looked straight  from the window to avoid attracting attention.
 The tumult of exultation  in her heart was so wild that she did not surely know whether she wanted  to sink to the floor, lay her face against the glass, and indulge in  what for generations women have referred to as "a good cry," or whether  she wanted to leap from the window and sport on the wind like a driven  leaf.
    Then she returned the letter and cheque to the envelope, and slipped it  inside her blouse, and started on her way to school.
 She might as well  have gone to Multiflores Canyon and pitted her strength against climbing  its walls for the day, for all the good she did in her school work.
  She heard no word of any recitation by her schoolmates.
 She had no word  ready when called on for a recitation herself.
 She heard nothing that  was said by any of the professors.
 On winged feet she was flying back  and forth from the desert to the mountains, from the canyons to the sea.
  She was raiding beds of amass and devising ways to roast the bulbs and  make a new dish.
 She was compounding drinks from mescal and bisnaga.
 She  was hunting desert pickles and trying to remember whether Indian rhubarb  ever grew so far south.
 She was glad when the dismissal hour came that  afternoon.
 With eager feet she went straight to the Consolidated Bank  and there she asked again to be admitted to the office of the president.
  Mr. Worthington rose as she came in.
    "Am I wrong in my dates?" he inquired.
 "I was not expecting you until  tomorrow.
"    "No, you're quite right," said Linda.
 "At this hour tomorrow.
 But, Mr.  Worthington, I am in trouble again.
"    Linda looked so distressed that the banker pushed a chair to the table's  side for her, and when she had seated herself, he said quietly: "Tell me  all about it, Linda.
 We must get life straightened out as best we can.
"    "I think I must tell you all about it," said Linda, "because I know just  enough about banking to know that I have a proposition that I don't  know how to handle.
 Are bankers like father confessors and doctors and  lawyers?"    "I think they are even more so," laughed Mr. Worthington.
 "Perhaps the  father confessor takes precedence, otherwise I believe people are quite  as much interested in their financial secrets as in anything else in all  this world.
 Have you a financial secret?"    "Yes," said Linda, "I have what is to me a big secret, and I don't in  the least know how to handle it, so right away I thought about you and  that you would be the one to tell me what I could do.
"    "Go ahead," said Mr. Worthington kindly.
 "I'll give you my word of honor  to keep any secret you confide to me.
"    Linda produced her letter.
 She opened it and without any preliminaries  handed it and the cheque to the banker.
 He looked at the cheque  speculatively, and then laid it aside and read the letter.
 He gave every  evidence of having read parts of it two or three times, then he examined  the cheque again, and glanced at Linda.
    "And just how did you come into possession of this, young lady?" he  inquired.
 "And what is it that you want of me?"    "Why, don't you see?" said Linda.
 "It's my letter and my cheque; I'm  'Jane Meredith.
' Now how am I going to get my money.
"    For one dazed moment Mr. Worthington studied Linda; then he threw back  his head and laughed unrestrainedly.
 He came around the table and took  both Linda's hands.
    "Bully for you!" he cried exultantly.
 "How I wish your father could see  the seed he has sown bearing its fruit.
 Isn't that fine? And do you want  to go on with this anonymously?"    "I think I must," said Linda.
 "I have said in my heart that no Jap, male  or female, young or old, shall take first honors in a class from which  I graduate; and you can see that if people generally knew this, it would  make it awfully hard for me to go on with my studies, and I don't know  that the editor who is accepting this work would take it if he knew  it were sent him by a high-school Junior.
 You see the dignified way in  which he addresses me as 'madam'?"    "I see," said Mr. Worthington reflectively.
    "I'm sure," said Linda with demure lips, though the eyes above them  were blazing and dancing at high tension, "I'm sure that the editor  is attaching a husband, and a house having a well-ordered kitchen, and  rather wide culinary experience to that 'dear madam.
'"    "And what about this book proposition?" asked the banker gravely.
 "That  would be a big thing for a girl of your age.
 Can you do it, and continue  your school work?"    "With the background I have, with the unused material I have, and with  vacation coming before long, I can do it easily," said Linda.
 "My school  work is not difficult for me.
 It only requires concentration for about  two hours in the preparation that each day brings.
 The remainder of the  time I could give to amplifying and producing new recipes.
"    "I see," said the banker.
 "So you have resolved, Linda, that you don't  want your editor to know your real name.
"    "Could scarcely be done," said Linda.
    "But have you stopped to think," said the banker, "that you will be  asked for personal history and about your residence, and no doubt a  photograph of yourself.
 If you continue this work anonymously you're  going to have trouble with more matters than cashing a cheque.
"    "But I am not going to have any trouble cashing a cheque," she said,  "because I have come straight to the man whose business is cheques.
"    "True enough," he said; "I SHALL have to arrange the cheque; there's not  a doubt about that; and as for your other bugbears.
"    "I refuse to be frightened by them," interposed Linda.
    "Have you ever done any business at the bank?"    "No," said Linda.
    "None of the clerks know you?"    "Not that I remember," said Linda.
 "I might possibly be acquainted with  some of them.
 I have merely passed through the bank on my way to your  room twice.
"    "Then," said the banker, "we'll have to risk it.
 After this estate  business is settled you will want to open an account in your name.
"    "Quite true," said Linda.
    "Then I would advise you," said Mr. Worthington, "to open this account  in your own name.
 Endorse this cheque 'Jane Meredith' and make it  payable to me personally.
 Whenever one of these comes, bring it to me  and I'll take care of it for you.
 One minute.
"    He left Linda sitting quietly reading and rereading her letter, and  presently returned and laid a sheaf of paper money before her.
    "Take it to the paying teller.
 Tell him that you wish to deposit it, and  ask him to give you a bank book and a cheque book," he said.
 "Thank you  very much for coming to me and for confiding in me.
"    Linda gathered up the money, and said good-bye to the banker.
 Just as  she started forward she recognized Eileen at the window of the paying  teller.
 It was an Eileen she never before had seen.
 Her face was  strained to a ghastly gray.
 Her hat was not straight and her hands were  shaking.
 Without realizing that she was doing it, Linda stepped behind  one of the huge marble pillars supporting the ceiling and stood there  breathlessly, watching Eileen.
 She could gather that she was discussing  the bank ledger which lay before the teller and that he was refusing  something that Eileen was imploring him to do.
 Linda thought she  understood what it was.
 Then very clearly Eileen's voice, sharp and  strained, reached her ears.
    "You mean that you are refusing to pay me my deposits on my private  account?" she cried; and Linda could also hear the response.
    "I am very sorry if it annoys or inconveniences you, Miss Strong, but  since the settlement of the estate takes place tomorrow, our orders are  to pay out no funds in any way connected with the estate until after  that settlement has been arranged.
"    "But this is my money, my own private affair," begged Eileen.
 "The  estate has nothing to do with it.
"    "I am sorry," repeated the teller.
 "If that is the case, you will have  no difficulty in establishing the fact in a few minutes' time.
"    Eileen turned and left the bank, and it seemed that she was almost  swaying.
 Linda stood a second with narrowed eyes, in deep thought.
    "I think," she said at last, deep down in her heart, "that it looks  precious much as if there had been a bit of transgression in this  affair.
 It looks, too, as if 'the way of the transgressor' were a darned  hard way.
 Straight ahead open and aboveboard for you, my girl!"    Then she went quietly to the desk and transacted her own business;  but her beautiful day was clouded.
 Her heart was no longer leaping  exultantly.
 She was sickened and sorrowful over the evident nerve strain  and discomfort which Eileen seemed to have brought upon herself.
 She  dreaded meeting her at dinner that night, and she wondered all the way  home where Eileen had gone from the bank and what she had been doing.
  What she felt was a pale affair compared with what she would have felt  if she could have seen Eileen leave the bank and enter a near-by  store, go to a telephone booth and put in a long-distance call for San  Francisco.
 Her eyes were brilliant, her cheeks by nature redder than  the rouge she had used upon them.
 She squared her shoulders, lifted  her head, as if she irrevocably had made a decision and would not be  thwarted in acting upon it.
 While she waited she straightened her hat,  and tucked up her pretty hair, once more evincing concern about her  appearance.
 After a nervous wait she secured her party.
    "Am I speaking with Mr. James Heitman?" she asked.
    "Yes," came the answer.
    "Well, Uncle Jim, this is Eileen.
"    "Why, hello, girlie," was the quick response.
 "Delighted that you're  calling your ancient uncle.
 Haven't changed the decision in the last  letter I had from you, have you?"    "Yes," said Eileen, "I have changed it.
 Do you and Aunt Caroline still  want me, Uncle Jim?"    "YOU BET WE WANT YOU!" roared the voice over the 'phone.
 "Here we are,  with plenty of money and not a relation on earth but you to leave it to.
  You belong to us by rights.
 We'd be tickled to death to have you, and  for you to have what's left of the money when we get through with it.
  May I come after you? Say the word, and I'll start this minute.
"    "Oh, Uncle Jim, could you? Would you?" cried Eileen.
    "Well, I'd say I could.
 We'd be tickled to death, I tell you!"    "How long would it take you to get here?" said Eileen.
    "Well, I could reach you by noon tomorrow.
 Eleven something is the  shortest time it's been made in; that would give me thirteen--more than  enough.
 Are you in that much of a hurry?"    "Yes," gasped Eileen, "yes, I am in the biggest kind of a hurry there  is, Uncle Jim.
 This troublesome little estate has to be settled tomorrow  afternoon.
 There's going to be complaint about everything that I have  seen fit to do.
 I've been hounded and harassed till I am disgusted with  it.
 Then I've promised to marry John Gilman as I wrote you, and I don't  believe you would think that was my best chance with the opportunities  you could give me.
 It seems foolish to stay here, abused as I have been  lately, and as I will be tomorrow.
 You have the house number.
 If you  come and get me out of it by noon tomorrow, I'll go with you.
 You may  take out those adoption papers you have always entreated me to agree to  and I'll be a daughter that you can be proud of.
 It will be a relief to  have some real money and some real position, and to breathe freely and  be myself once more.
"    "All right for you, girlie!" bellowed the great voice over the line.
  "Pick up any little personal bits you can put in a suitcase, and by  twelve o'clock tomorrow I'll whisk you right out of that damn mess.
"    Eileen walked from the telephone booth with her head high, triumph  written all over her face and figure.
 They were going to humiliate her.
  She would show them!    She went home immediately.
 Entering her room, she closed the door and  stood looking at her possessions.
 How could she get her trunk from the  garret? How could she get it to the station? Would it be possible for  Uncle James to take it in his car? As she pondered these things Eileen  had a dim memory of a day in her childhood when her mother had gone on  business to San Francisco and had taken her along.
 She remembered a  huge house, all turrets and towers and gables, all turns and twists  and angles, closed to the light of day and glowing inside with shining  artificial lights.
 She remembered stumbling over deep rugs.
 One vivid  impression was of walls covered with huge canvases, some of them having  frames more than a foot wide.
 She remembered knights in armor, and big  fireplaces, and huge urns and vases.
 It seemed to her like the most  wonderful bazaar she ever had been in.
 She remembered, too, that she had  been glad when her mother had taken her out into the sunshine again and  from the presence of two ponderous people who had objected strongly to  everything her mother had discussed with them.
 She paused one instant,  contemplating this picture.
 The look of triumph on her face toned down  considerably.
 Then she comforted herself aloud.
    "I've heard Mother say," she said softly, "that everybody overdid things  and did not know how to be graceful with immense fortunes got from  silver and gold mines, and lumber.
 It will be different now.
 Probably  they don't live in the same house, even.
 There is a small army of  servants, and there is nothing I can think of that Uncle Jim won't  gladly get me.
 I've been too big a fool for words to live this way as  long as I have.
 Crush me, will they? I'll show them! I won't even touch  these things I have strained so to get.
"    Eileen jerked from her throat the strand of pearls that she had worn  continuously for four years and threw it contemptuously on her dressing  table.
    "I'll make Uncle Jim get me a rope with two or three strands in it that  will reach to my waist.
 'A suitcase!' I don't know what I would fill a  suitcase with from here.
 The trunk may stay in the garret, and while I  am leaving all this rubbish, I'll just leave John Gilman with it.
 Uncle  Jim will give me an income that will buy all the cigarettes I want  without having to deceive anyone; and I can have money if I want to  stake something at bridge without being scared into paralysis for fear  somebody may find it out or the accounts won't balance.
 I'll put on the  most suitable thing I have to travel in, and just walk out and leave  everything else.
"    That was what Eileen did.
 At noon the next day her eyes were bright with  nervousness.
 Her cheeks alternately paled with fear and flooded red with  anxiety.
 She had dressed herself carefully, laid out her hat and gloves  and a heavy coat in case the night should be chilly.
 Once she stood  looking at the dainty, brightly colored dresses hanging in her wardrobe  A flash of regret passed over her face.
    "Tawdry little cheap things and makeshifts," she said.
 "If Linda feels  that she has been so terribly defrauded, she can help herself now!"    By twelve o'clock she found herself standing at the window, straining  her eyes down Lilac Valley.
 She was not looking at its helpful hills,  at its appealing curves, at its brilliant colors.
 She was watching the  roadway.
 When Katy rang to call her to lunch, she told her to put the  things away; she was expecting people who would take her out to lunch  presently.
 In the past years she had occasionally written to her uncle.
  Several times when he had had business in Los Angeles she had met him at  his hotel and dined with him.
 She reasoned that he would come straight  to the house and get her, and then they would go to one of the big  hotels for lunch before they started.
    "I shan't feel like myself," said Eileen, "until we are well on the way  to San Francisco.
"    At one o'clock she was walking the floor.
 At two she was almost frantic.
  At half past she almost wished that she had had the good sense to have  some lunch, since she was very hungry and under tense nerve strain.
 Once  she paused before the glass, but what she saw frightened her.
 Just when  she felt that she could not endure the strain another minute, grinding  brakes, the blast of a huge Klaxon, and the sound of a great voice arose  from the street.
 Eileen rushed to the window.
 She took one look, caught  up the suitcase and raced down the stairs.
 At the door she met a bluff,  big man, gross from head to foot.
 It seemed to Eileen strange that she  could see in him even a trace of her mother, and yet she could.
 Red  veins crossed his cheeks and glowed on his nose.
 His tired eyes  were watery; his thick lips had an inclination to sag; but there was  heartiness in his voice and earnestness in the manner in which he picked  her up.
    "What have they been doing to you down here?" he demanded.
 "Never should  have left you this long.
 Ought to have come down and taken you and  showed you what you wanted, and then you would have known whether you  wanted it or not.
"    At this juncture a huge woman, gross in a feminine way as her husband  was in his, paddled up the walk.
    "I'm comin' in and rest a few minutes," she said.
 "I'm tired to death  and I'm pounded to pieces.
"    Her husband turned toward her.
 He opened his lips to introduce Eileen.
  His wife forestalled him.
    "So this is the Eileen you have been ravin' about for years," she said.
  "I thought you said she was a pretty girl.
"    Eileen's soul knew one sick instant of recoil.
 She looked from James  Heitman to Caroline, his wife, and remembered that he had a habit  of calling her "Callie.
" All that paint and powder and lipstick and  brilliantine could do to make the ponderous, big woman more ghastly had  been done, but in the rush of the long ride through which her husband  had forced her, the colors had mixed and slipped, the false waves were  displaced.
 She was not in any condition to criticize the appearance  of another woman.
 For one second Eileen hesitated, then she lifted her  shaking hands to her hat.
    "I have been hounded out of my senses," she said apologetically, "and  have been so terribly anxious for fear you wouldn't get here on time.
  Please, Aunt Caroline, let us go to a hotel, some place where we can  straighten up comfortably.
"    "Well, what's your hurry?" said Aunt Caroline coolly.
 "You're not a  fugitive from justice, are you? Can't a body rest a few minutes and have  a drink, even? Besides, I am going to see what kind of a place you've  been living in, and then I'll know how thankful you'll be for what we  got to offer.
"    Eileen turned and threw open the door.
 The big woman walked in.
 She  looked down the hall, up the stairway, and went on to the living room.
  She gave it one contemptuous glance, and turning, came back to the door.
    "All right, Jim," she said brusquely.
 "I have seen enough.
 If you know  the best hotel in the town, take me there.
 And then, if Eileen's in such  a hurry, after we have had a bite we'll start for home.
"    "Thank you, Aunt Caroline, oh, thank you!" cried Eileen.
    "You needn't take the trouble to 'aunt' me every time you speak to me,"  said the lady.
 "I know you're my niece, but I ain't goin' to remind you  of it every time I speak to you.
 It's agein', this 'auntie' business.
  I don't stand for it, and as for a name, I am free to confess I always  like the way Jim calls me 'Callie.
' That sounds younger and more  companionable than 'Caroline.
'"    James Heitman looked at Eileen and winked.
    "You just bet, old girl!" he said.
 "They ain't any of them can beat  you, not even Eileen at her best.
 Let's get her out of here.
 Does this  represent your luggage, girlie?"    "You said not to bother with anything else," said Eileen.
    "So I did," said Uncle Jim, "and I meant just what I said if it's all  right with you.
 I suppose I did have, in the back of my head, an idea  that there might be a trunk or a box--some things that belonged to your  mother, mebby, and your 'keepsakes.
'"    "Oh, never mind," interrupted Eileen.
 "Do let's go.
 It's nearly four  o'clock.
 Any minute they may send for me from the bank, and I'd be more  than glad to be out of the way.
"    "Well, I'm not accustomed to being the porter, but if time's that  precious, here we go," said Uncle Jim.
    He picked up the suitcase with one hand and took his wife's arm with the  other.
    "Scoot down there and climb into that boat," he said proudly to Eileen.
  "We'll have a good dinner in a private room when we get to the hotel.
 I  won't even register.
 And then we'll get out of here when we have rested  a little.
"    "Can't we stay all night and go in the morning?" panted his wife.
    "No, ma'am, we can't," said James Heitman authoritatively.
 "We'll eat  a bite because we need to be fed up, and I sincerely hope they's some  decent grub to be had in this burg.
 The first place we come to outside  of here, that looks like they had a decent bed, we'll stop and make up  for last night.
 But we ain't a-goin' to stay here if Eileen wants us to  start right away, eh, Eileen?"    "Yes, please!" panted Eileen.
 "I just don't want to meet any of them.
  It's time enough for them to know what has happened after I am gone.
"    "All right then," said Uncle James.
 "Pile in and we'll go.
"    So Eileen started on the road to the unlimited wealth her soul had  always craved.
        .
 Linda's First Party    At the bank Linda and John Gilman waited an hour past the time set for  Eileen's appearance.
 Then Linda asserted herself.
    "I have had a feeling for some time," she said quietly, "that Eileen  would not appear today, and if she doesn't see fit to come, there is no  particular reason why she should.
 There is nothing to do but go over  the revenue from the estate.
 The books will show what Eileen has drawn  monthly for her expense budget.
 That can be set aside and the remainder  divided equally between us.
 It's very simple.
 Here is a letter I wrote  to the publishers of Father's books asking about royalties.
 I haven't  even opened it.
 I will turn it in with the remainder of the business.
"    They were in the office with the president of the bank.
 He rang for the  clerk he wanted and the books he required, and an hour's rapid figuring  settled the entire matter, with the exception of the private account,  amounting to several thousands, standing in Eileen's name.
 None of them  knew any source of separate income she might have.
 At a suggestion from  Linda, the paying teller was called in and asked if he could account for  any of the funds that had gone into the private account.
    "Not definitely," he said, "but the amounts always corresponded  exactly with the royalties from the books.
 I strongly suspect that they  constitute this private account of Miss Eileen's.
"    But he did not say that she had tried to draw it the day previous.
    John Gilman made the suggestion that they should let the matter rest  until Eileen explained about it.
 Then Linda spoke very quietly, but with  considerable finality in her tone.
    "No," she said, "I know that Eileen HAD no source of private income.
  Mother used to mention that she had some wealthy relatives in San  Francisco, but they didn't approve of her marriage to what they called  a 'poor doctor,' and she would never accept, or allow us to accept,  anything from them.
 They never came to see us and we never went to see  them.
 Eileen knows no more about them than I do.
 We will work upon the  supposition that everything that is here belonged to Father.
 Set aside  to Eileen's credit the usual amount for housekeeping expenses.
 Turn the  private account in with the remainder.
 Start two new bank books, one for  Eileen and one for me.
 Divide the surplus each month exactly in halves.
  And I believe this is the proper time for the bank to turn over to me  a certain key, specified by my father as having been left in your  possession to be delivered to me on my coming of age.
"    With the key in her possession, Linda and John Gilman left the bank.
 As  they stood for a moment in front of the building, Gilman removed his hat  and ran his hands through his hair as if it were irritating his head.
    "Linda," he said in a deeply wistful tone, "I don't understand this.
 Why  shouldn't Eileen have come today as she agreed? What is there about this  that is not according to law and honor and the plain, simple rights of  the case?"    "I don't know," said Linda; "but there is something we don't understand  about it.
 And I am going to ask you, John, as my guardian, closing up my  affairs today, to go home with me to be present when I open the little  hidden door I found at the back of a library shelf when I was disposing  of Daddy's technical books.
 There was a slip of paper at the edge of it  specifying that the key was in possession of the Consolidated Bank and  was to be delivered to me, in the event of Daddy's passing, on my coming  of age.
 I have the key, but I would like to have you with me, and Eileen  if she is in the house, when I open that door.
 I don't know what is  behind it, but there's a certain feeling that always has been strong in  my heart and it never was so strong as it is at this minute.
"    So they boarded the street car and ran out to Lilac Valley.
 When Katy  admitted them Linda put her arm around her and kissed her.
 She could see  that the house was freshly swept and beautifully decorated with flowers,  and her trained nostrils could scent whiffs of delicious odors from  food of which she was specially fond.
 In all her world Katy was the one  person who was celebrating her birthday.
 She seemed rather surprised  when Linda and Gilman came in together.
    "Where is Eileen?" inquired Linda.
    "She must have made some new friends," said Katy.
 "About four o'clock,  the biggest car that ever roared down this street rolled up, and the  biggest man and woman that I ever see came puffin' and pantin' in.
 Miss  Eileen did not tell me where she was goin' or when she would be back,  but I know it won't be the night, because she took her little dressin'  case with her.
 Belike it's another of them trips to Riverside or  Pasadena.
"    "Very likely," said Linda quietly.
 "Katy, can you spare a few minutes?"    "No, lambie, I jist can't," said Katy, "because a young person that's  the apple of me eye is havin' a birthday the day and I have got me  custard cake in the oven and the custard is in the makin', and after  Miss Eileen went and I didn't see no chance for nothin' special, I  jist happened to look out, one of the ways ye do things unbeknownst  to yourself, and there stood Mr. Pater Morrison moonin' over the  'graveyard,' like he called it, and it was lookin' like seein' graves he  was, and I jist took the bull by the horns, and I sings out to him and  I says: 'Mr. Pater Morrison, it's a good friend ye were to the young  missus when ye engineered her skylight and her beautiful fireplace, and  this bein' her birthday, I'm takin' the liberty to ask ye to come to  dinner and help me celebrate.
' And he said he would run up to the garage  and get into his raygimentals, whatever them might be, and he would be  here at six o'clock.
 So ye got a guest for dinner, and if the custard's  scorched and the cake's flat, it's up to ye for kapin' me here to tell  ye all this.
"    Then Katy hurried to the kitchen.
 Linda looked at John Gilman and  smiled.
    "Isn't that like her?" she said.
    Then she led the way to the library, pulled aside the books, fitted the  key to the little door, and opened it.
 Inside lay a single envelope,  sealed and bearing her name.
 She took the envelope, and walking to her  father's chair beside his library table, sat down in it, and laying the  envelope on the table, crossed her hands on top of it.
    "John," she said, "ever since I have been big enough to think and reason  and study things out for myself, there is a feeling I have had--I used  to think it was unreasonable, then I thought it remote possibility.
 This  minute I think it's extremely probable.
 Before I open this envelope I am  going to tell you what I believe it contains.
 I have not the slightest  evidence except personal conviction, but I believe that the paper inside  this envelope is written by my father's hand and I believe it tells me  that he was not Eileen's father and that I am not her sister.
 If it  does not say this, then there is nothing in race and blood and inherited  tendencies.
"    Linda picked up the paper cutter, ran it across the envelope, slipped  out the sheet, and bracing herself she read:    MY DARLING LINDA:    These lines are to tell you that your mother went to her eternal sleep  when you were born.
 Four years later I met and fell in love with the  only mother you ever have known.
 At the time of our marriage we entered  into a solemn compact that her little daughter by a former marriage and  mine should be reared as sisters.
 I was to give half my earnings and to  do for Eileen exactly as I did for you.
 She was to give half her love  and her best attention to your interests.
    I sincerely hope that what I have done will not result in any discomfort  or inconvenience to you.
    With dearest love, as ever your father,    ALEXANDER STRONG.
    Linda laid the sheet on the table and dropped her hands on top of it.
  Then she looked at John Gilman.
    "John," she said, "I believe you had better face the fact that the big  car and the big people that carried Eileen away today were her mother's  wealthy relatives from San Francisco.
 She must have been in touch with  them.
 I think very likely she sent for them after I saw her in the bank  yesterday afternoon, trying with all her might to make the paying teller  turn over to her the funds of the private account.
"    John Gilman sat very still for a long time, then he raised tired,  disappointed eyes to Linda's face.
    "Linda," he said, "do you mean you think Eileen was not straight about  money matters?"    "John," said Linda quietly, "I think it is time for the truth about  Eileen between you and me.
 If you want me to answer that question  candidly, I'll answer it.
"    "I want the truth," said John Gilman gravely.
    "Well," said Linda, "I never knew Eileen to be honest about anything  in all her life unless the truth served her better than an evasion.
 Her  hair was not honest color and it was not honest curl.
 Her eyebrows were  not so dark as she made them.
 Her cheeks and lips were not so red, her  forehead and throat were not so white, her form was not so perfect.
 Her  friends were selected because they could serve her.
 As long as you were  poor and struggling, Marian was welcome to you.
 When you won a great  case and became prosperous and fame came rapidly, Eileen took you.
 I  believe what I told you a minute ago: I think she has gone for good.
 I  think she went because she had not been fair and she would not be forced  to face the fact before you and me and the president of the Consolidated  today.
 I think you will have to take your heart home tonight and I think  that before the night is over you will realize what Marian felt when she  knew that in addition to having been able to take you from her, Eileen  was not a woman who would make you happy.
 I am glad, deeply glad, that  there is not a drop of her blood in my veins, sorry as I am for you and  much as I regret what has happened.
 I won't ask you to stay tonight,  because you must go through the same black waters Marian breasted, and  you will want to be alone.
 Later, if you think of any way I can serve  you, I will be glad for old sake's sake; but you must not expect me ever  to love you or respect your judgment as I did before the shadow fell.
"    Then Linda rose, replaced the letter, turned the key in the lock, and  quietly slipped out of the room.
    When she opened her door and stepped into her room she paused in  astonishment.
 Spread out upon the bed lay a dress of georgette with  little touches of fur and broad ribbons of satin.
 In color it was  like the flame of seasoned beechwood.
 Across the foot of the bed hung  petticoat, camisole, and hose, and beside the dress a pair of satin  slippers exactly matching the hose, and they seemed the right size.
  Linda tiptoed to the side of the bed and delicately touched the dress,  and then she saw a paper lying on the waist front, and picking it up  read:    Lambie, here's your birthday, from loving old Katy.
    The lines were terse and to the point.
 Linda laid them down, and picking  up the dress she walked to the mirror, and holding it under her chin  glanced down the length of its reflection.
 What she saw almost stunned  her.
    "Oh, good Lord!" she said.
 "I can't wear that.
 That isn't me.
"    Then she tossed the dress on the bed and started in a headlong rush to  the kitchen.
 As she came through the door, "You blessed old darling!"  she cried.
 "What am I going to say to make you know how I appreciate  your lovely, lovely gift?"    Katy raised her head.
 There was something that is supposed to be the  prerogative of royalty in the lift of it.
 Her smile was complacent in  the extreme.
    "Don't ye be standin' there wastin' no time talkie'," she said.
    "I have oodles of time," said Linda, "but I warn you, you won't know me  if I put on that frock, Katy.
"    "Yes, I will, too," said Katy.
    "Katy," said Linda, sobering suddenly, "would it make any great  difference to you if I were the only one here for always, after this?"    Katy laughed contemptuously.
    "Well, I'd warrant to survive it," she said coolly.
    "But that is exactly what I must tell you, Katy," said Linda soberly.
  "You know I have told you a number of times through these years that I  did not believe Eileen and I were sisters, and I am telling you now that  I know it.
 She did not come to the bank today, and the settlement of  Father's affairs developed the fact that I was my father's child and  Eileen was her mother's; and I'm thinking, Katy, that the big car  you saw and the opulent people in it were Eileen's mother's wealthy  relatives from San Francisco.
 My guess is, Katy, that Eileen has gone  with them for good.
 Lock her door and don't touch her things until we  know certainly what she wants done with them.
"    Katy stood thinking intently, then she lifted her eyes to Linda's.
    "Lambie," she whispered softly, "are we ixpicted to go into mourning  over this?"    A mischievous light leaped into Linda's eyes.
    "Well, if there are any such expectations abroad, Katherine O'Donovan,"  she said soberly, "the saints preserve 'em, for we can't fulfill 'em,  can we, Katy?"     "Not to be savin' our souls," answered Katy heartily.
  "I'm jist  so glad and thankful that I don't know what to do, and it's such good  news that I don't belave one word of it.
 And while you're talkie', what  about John Gilman?"    "I think," said Linda quietly, "that tonight is going to teach him how  Marian felt in her blackest hours.
"    "Well, he needn't be coming to me for sympathy," said Katy.
 "But if Miss  Eileen has gone to live with the folks that come after her the day, ye  might be savin' a wee crap o' sympathy for her, lambie.
 They was jist  the kind of people that you'd risk your neck slidin' down a mountain to  get out of their way.
"    "That is too bad," said Linda reflectively; "because Eileen is sensitive  and constant contact with crass vulgarity certainly would wear on her  nerves.
"    "Now you be goin' and gettin' into that dress, lambie," said Katy.
    "Katherine O'Donovan," said Linda, "you're used to it; come again to  confession.
 Tell me truly where and how did you get that dress?"    "'Tain't no rule of polite society to be lookin' gift horses in the  mouth," said Katy proudly.
 "HOW I got it is me own affair, jist like ye  got any gifts ye was ever makin' me, is yours.
 WHERE I got it? I went  into the city on the strafe car and I went to the biggest store in the  city and I got in the elevator and I says to the naygur: 'Let me off  where real ladies buy ready-to-wear dresses.
'    "And up comes a little woman, and her hair was jist as soft and curling  round her ears, and brown and pretty was her eyes, and the pink that  God made was in her cheeks, and in a voice like runnin' water she says:  'Could I do anything for you?' I told her what I wanted.
 And she says:  'How old is the young lady, and what's her size, and what's her color?'  Darlin', ain't that dress the answer to what I told her?"    "Yes," said Linda.
 "If an artist had been selecting a dress for me he  would probably have chosen that one.
 But, old dear, it's not suitable  for me.
 It's not the kind of dress that I intended to wear for years and  years yet.
 Do you think, if I put it on tonight, I'll ever be able to  go back to boots and breeches again, and hunt the canyons for plants to  cook for--you know what?"    Katy stood in what is commonly designated as a "brown study.
" Then she  looked Linda over piercingly.
    "Yes, ma'am," she said conclusively.
 "It's my judgment that ye will.
 I  think ye'll maybe wrap the braids of ye around your head tonight, and I  think ye'll put on that frock, and I think ye'll show Pater Morrison how  your pa's daughter can sit at the head of his table and entertain her  friends.
 Then I think ye'll hang it in your closet and put on your boots  and breeches and go back to your old Multiflores and attind to your  business, the same as before.
"    "All right, Katy," said Linda, "if you have that much faith in me I have  that much faith in myself; but, old dear, I can't tell you how I LOVE  having a pretty dress for tonight.
 Katy dear, the 'Day of Jubilee' has  come.
 Before you go to sleep I'm coming to your room to tell you fine  large secrets, that you won't believe for a minute, but I haven't the  time to do it now.
"    Then Linda raced to her room and began dressing.
 She let down the mop of  her hair waving below her waist and looked at it despairingly.
    "That dress never was made for braids down your back," she said,  glancing toward the bed where it lay shimmering in a mass of lovely  color.
 "I am of age today; for state occasions I should be a woman.
 What  shall I do with it?"    And then she recalled Katy's voice saying: "Braids round your head.
"    "Of course," said Linda, "that would be the thing to do.
 I certainly  don't need anything to add to my height; I am far too tall now.
"    So she parted her hair in the middle, brushed it back, divided it in  even halves, and instead of braiding it, she coiled it around her head,  first one side and then the other.
    She slipped into the dress and struggled with its many and intricate  fastenings.
 Then she went to the guest room to stand before the  full-length mirror there.
 Slowly she turned.
 Critically she examined  herself.
    "It's a bit shorter than I would have ordered it," she said, "but it  reduces my height, it certainly gives wonderful freedom in walking, and  it's not nearly so short as I see other girls wearing.
"    Again she studied herself critically.
    "Need some kind of ornament for my hair," she muttered, "but I haven't  got it, and neither do I own beads, bracelet, or a ring; and my ears are  sticking right out in the air.
 I am almost offensively uncovered.
"    Then she went down to show herself to a delighted Katy.
 When the  doorbell rang Linda turned toward the hall.
 Katy reached a detaining  hand.
    "You'll do nothing of the sort," she said.
 "I answered the bell for Miss  Eileen.
 Answer the bell I shall for you.
"    Down the hall went Katy with the light of battle in her eyes and the  air of a conqueror in the carriage of her head.
 She was well trained.
  Neither eyelid quivered as she flung the door wide to Peter Morrison.
  He stood there in dinner dress, more imposing than Katy had thought he  could be.
 With quick, inner exultation she reached for two parcels he  carried; over them her delight was so overpowering that Peter Morrison  must have seen a hint of it.
 With a flourish Katy seated him, and  carried the packages to Linda.
 She returned a second later for a big  vase, and in this Linda arranged a great sheaf of radiant roses.
 As Katy  started to carry them back to the room, Linda said "Wait a second," and  selecting one half opened, she slipped it out, shortened the stem and  tucked it among the coils of hair where she would have set an ornament.
  The other package was a big box that when opened showed its interior  to be divided into compartments in each of which nestled an exquisite  flower made of spun sugar.
 The petals, buds, and leaves were  perfect.
 There were wonderful roses with pale pink outer petals and  deeper-colored hearts.
 There were pink mallows that seemed as if they  must have been cut from the bushes bordering Santa Monica road.
 There  were hollyhocks of white and gold, and simply perfect tulips.
 Linda  never before had seen such a treasure candy box.
 She cried out in  delight, and hurried to show Katy.
 In her pleasure over the real flowers  and the candy flowers Linda forgot her dress, but when she saw Peter  Morrison standing tall and straight, in dinner dress, she stopped and  looked the surprise and pleasure she felt.
 She had grown accustomed  to Peter in khaki pottering around his building.
 This Peter she never  before had seen.
 He represented something of culture, something of  pride, a conformity to a nice custom and something more.
 Linda was not a  psychoanalyst.
    She could not see a wonderful aura of exquisite color enveloping Peter.
  But when Peter saw the girl approaching him, transformed into a woman  whose shining coronet was jewelled with his living red rose, when he saw  the beauty of her lithe slenderness clothed in a soft, flaming color,  something emanated from his inner consciousness that Linda did see,  and for an instant it disturbed her as she went forward holding out her  hands.
    "Peter," she said gaily, "do you know that this is my Day of Jubilee? I  am a woman today by law, Peter.
 Hereafter I am to experience at least  a moderate degree of financial freedom, and that I shall enjoy.
 But the  greatest thing in life is friends.
"    Peter took both the hands extended to him and looked smilingly into her  eyes.
    "You take my breath," he said.
 "I knew, the first glimpse I ever had  of you scrambling from the canyon floor, that this transformation COULD  take place.
 My good fortune is beyond words that I have been first to  see it.
 Permit me, fair lady.
"    Peter bent and kissed both her hands.
 He hesitated a second, then he  turned the right hand and left one more kiss in its palm.
    "To have and to hold!" he said whimsically.
    "Thank you," said Linda, closing her fist over it and holding it up for  inspection.
 "I'll see that it doesn't escape.
 And this minute I thank  you for the candy, which I know is delicious, and for my very first  sheaf of roses from any man.
 See what I have done with one of them?"    She turned fully around that he might catch the effect of the rose,  and in getting that he also got the full effect of the costume, and the  possibilities of the girl before him.
 And then she gave him a shock.
    "Isn't it a lovely frock?" she said.
 "Another birthday gift from the  Strong rock of ages.
 I have been making a collection of rocks for my  fern bed, and I have got another collection that is not visible to  anyone save myself.
 Katy's a rock, and you're a rock, and Donald is a  rock, and Marian's a rock, and I am resting securely on all of you.
 I  wish my father knew that in addition to Marian and Katy I have found two  more such wonderful friends.
"    "And what about Henry Anderson?" inquired Peter.
 "Aren't you going to  include him?"    Linda walked over to the chair in which she intended to seat herself.
    "Peter," she said, "I wish you hadn't asked me that.
"    Peter's figure tensed suddenly.
    "Look here, Linda," he said sternly, "has that rather bold youngster  made himself in any way offensive to you?"    "Not in any way that I am not perfectly capable of handling myself,"  said Linda.
 She looked at Peter confidently.
    "Do you suppose," she said, "that I can sit down in this thing without  ruining it? Shouldn't I really stand up while I am wearing it?"    Peter laughed unrestrainedly.
    "Linda, you're simply delicious," he said.
 "It seems to me that I have  seen young ladies in like case reach round and gather the sash to one  side and smooth out the skirt as they sit.
"    "Thank you, Peter, of course that would be the way," said Linda.
 "This  being my first, I'm lacking in experience.
"    And thereupon she sat according to direction; while Peter sat opposite  her.
    "Now finish.
 Just one word more about Henry Anderson," he said.
 "Are you  perfectly sure there is nothing I need do for you in that connection?"    "Oh, perfectly," said Linda lightly.
 "I didn't mean to alarm you.
 He  merely carried that bug-catcher nonsense a trifle too far.
 I wouldn't  have minded humoring him and fooling about it a little.
 But, Peter, do  you know him quite well? Are you very sure of him?"    "No," said Peter, "I don't know him well at all.
 The only thing I am  sure about him is that he is doing well in his profession.
 I chose him  because he was an ambitious youngster and I thought I could get more  careful attention from him than I could from some of the older fellows  who had made their reputation.
 You see, there are such a lot of things I  want to know about in this building proposition, and the last four years  haven't been a time for any man to be careful about saving his money.
"    "Then," said Linda, "he is all right, of course.
 He must be.
 But I think  I'm like a cat.
 I'm very complacent with certain people, but when I  begin to get goose flesh and hair prickles my head a bit, I realize that  there is something antagonistic around, something for me to beware of.
 I  guess it's because I am such a wild creature.
"    "Do you mean to say," said Peter, "that these are the sensations that  Henry gives you?"    Linda nodded.
    "Now forget Henry," she said.
 "I have had such a big day I must tell  you about it, and then we'll come to that last article you left me.
  I haven't had time to put anything on paper concerning it yet, but I  believe I have an awfully good idea in the paint pot, and I'll find time  in a day or two to work it out.
 Peter, I have just come from the bank,  where I was recognized as of legal age, and my guardian discharged.
 And  perhaps I ought to explain to you, Peter, that your friend, John Gilman,  is not here because this night is going to be a bad one for him.
 When  you knew him best he was engaged, or should have been, to Marian Thorne.
  When you met him this time he really was engaged to Eileen.
 I don't  know what you think about Eileen.
 I don't feel like influencing anyone's  thought concerning her, so I'll merely say that today has confirmed a  conviction that always has been in my heart.
 Katy could tell you that  long ago I said to her that I did not believe Eileen was my sister.
  Today has brought me the knowledge and proof positive that she is not,  and today she has gone to some wealthy relatives of her mother in San  Francisco.
 She expressed her contempt for what she was giving up by  leaving everything, including the exquisite little necklace of pearls  which has been a daily part of her since she owned them.
 I may be  mistaken, but intuition tells me that with the pearls and the wardrobe  she has also discarded John Gilman.
 I think your friend will be  suffering tonight quite as deeply as my friend suffered when John  abandoned her at a time when she had lost everything else in life but  her money.
 I feel very sure that we won't see Eileen any more.
 I hope  she will have every lovely thing in life.
"    "Amen," said Peter Morrison earnestly.
 "I loved John Gilman when we were  in school together, but I have not been able to feel, since I located  here, that he is exactly the same John; and what you have told me very  probably explains the difference in him.
"    When Katy announced dinner Linda arose.
    Peter Morrison stepped beside her and offered his arm.
 Linda rested her  finger tips upon it and he led her to the head of the table and seated  her.
 Then Katy served a meal that, if it had been prepared for Eileen,  she would have described as a banquet.
 She gave them delicious, finely  flavored food, stimulating, exquisitely compounded drinks that she had  concocted from the rich fruits of California and mints and essences at  her command.
 When, at the close of the meal, she brought Morrison some  of the cigars Eileen kept for John Gilman, she set a second tray before  Linda, and this tray contained two packages.
 Linda looked at Katy  inquiringly, and Katy, her face beaming, nodded her sandy red head  emphatically.
    "More birthday gifts you've havin', me lady," she said in her mellowest  Irish voice.
    "More?" marveled Linda.
 She picked up the larger package, and opening  it, found a beautiful book inscribed from her friend Donald, over which  she passed caressing fingers.
    "Why, how lovely of him!" she said.
 "How in this world did he know?"    Katherine O'Donovan could have answered that question, but she did not.
  The other package was from Marian.
 When she opened it Linda laughed  unrestrainedly.
    "What a joke!" she said.
 "I had promised myself that I would not touch  a thing in Eileen's room, and before I could do justice to Katy's lovely  dress I had to go there for pins for my hair and powder for my nose.
  This is Marian's way of telling me that I am almost a woman.
 Will you  look at this?"    "Well, just what is it?" inquired Peter.
    "Hairpins," laughed Linda, "and hair ornaments, and a box of face  powder, and the little, feminine touches that my dressing table needs  badly.
 How would you like, Peter, to finish your cigar in my workroom?"    "I would like it immensely," said Peter.
    So together they climbed to the top of the house.
 Linda knelt and made a  little ceremony of lighting the first fire in her fireplace.
 She pushed  one of her chairs to one side for Peter, and taking the other for  herself, she sat down and began the process of really becoming  acquainted with him.
 Two hours later, as he was leaving her, Peter made  a circuit of the room, scrutinizing the sketches and paintings that were  rapidly covering the walls, and presently he came to the wasp.
 He looked  at it so closely that he did not miss even the stinger.
 Linda stood  beside him when he made his first dazed comment: "If that isn't Eileen,  and true to the life!"    "I must take that down," said Linda.
 "I did it one night when my heart  was full of bitterness.
"    "Better leave it," said Peter drily.
    "Do you think I need it as a warning?" asked Linda.
    Peter turned and surveyed her slowly.
    "Linda," he said quietly, "what I think of you has not yet been written  in any of the books.
"        .
 Buena Moza    As soon as Peter had left her Linda took her box of candy flowers and  several of her finest roses and went to Katy's room.
 She found Katy in a  big rocking chair, her feet on a hassock, reading a story in Everybody's  home.
 When her door opened and she saw her young mistress framed in it  she tossed the magazine aside and sprang to her feet, but Linda made her  resume her seat.
 The girl shortened the stems of the roses and put them  in a vase on Katy's dresser.
    "They may clash with your coloring a mite, Mother Machree," she said,  "but by themselves they are very wonderful things, aren't they?"    Linda went over, and drawing her dress aside, sat down on the hassock  and leaning against Katy's knee she held up the box of candy flowers for  amazed and delighted inspection.
    "Ah, the foine gintleman!" cried Katy.
 "Sure 'twas only a pape I had  when ye opened the box, an' I didn't know how rare them beauties railly  was.
"    "Choose the one you like best," said Linda.
    But Katy would not touch the delicate things, so Linda selected a brushy  hollyhock for her and then sat at her knee again.
    "Katherine O'Donovan," she said solemnly, "it's up to a couple of young  things such as we are, stranded on the shoals of the Pacific as we have  been, to put our heads together and take counsel.
 You're a host, Katy,  and while I am taking care of you, I'll be just delighted to have you go  on looking after your black sheep; but it's going to be lonely, for all  that.
 After Eileen has taken her personal possessions, what do you  say to fixing up that room with the belongings that Marian kept, and  inviting her to make that suite her home until such time as she may have  a home of her own again?"    "Foine!" cried Katy.
 "I'd love to be havin' her.
 I'd agree to take  orders from Miss Marian and to be takin' care of her jist almost the  same as I do of ye, Miss Linda.
 The one thing I don't like about it is  that it ain't fair nor right to give even Marian the best.
 Ye be takin'  that suite yourself, lambie, and give Miss Marian your room all fixed up  with her things, or, if ye want her nearer, give her the guest room and  make a guest room of yours.
"    "I am willing to follow either of the latter suggestions for myself,"  said Linda; "it might be pleasant to be across the hall from Marian  where we could call back and forth to each other.
 I wouldn't mind a  change as soon as I have time to get what I'd need to make the change.
  I'll take the guest room for mine, and you may call in a decorator and  have my room freshly done and the guest things moved into it.
"    Katy looked belligerent.
 Linda reached up and touched the frowning lines  on her forehead.
    "Brighten your lovely features with a smile, Katherine me dear," she  said gaily.
 "Don't be forgetting that this is our Day of Jubilee.
 We  are free--I hope we are free forever--from petty annoyances and  dissatisfactions and little, galling things that sear the soul and bring  out all the worst in human nature.
 I couldn't do anything to Eileen's  suite, not even if I resorted to tearing out partitions and making it  new from start to finish, that would eliminate Eileen from it for me.
 If  Marian will give me permission to move and install her things in it,  I think she can use it without any such feeling, but I couldn't.
 It's  agreed then, Katy, I am to write to Marian and extend to her a welcome  on your part as well as on mine?"    "That ye may, lambie," said Katy heartily.
 "And, as the boss used to be  sabin', just to make assurance doubly sure, if YoU would address it  for me I would be writing' a bit of a line myself, conveying' to her me  sentiments on the subject.
"    "Oh, fine, Katy; Marian would be delighted!" cried Linda, springing up.
    "And, Katy dear, it won't make us feel any more like mourning for Eileen  when I tell you that it developed at the bank yesterday and today, that  since she has been managing household affairs she has deposited in a  separate account all the royalties from Father's books.
 I had thought  the matter closed at the bank when this fund was added to the remainder  of the estate, the household expenses set aside to Eileen, and the  remainder divided equally between us.
 I didn't get the proof that she  was not my sister until after I came home.
 I think it means that I shall  have to go back to the bank, have the matter reopened, and unless she  can produce a will or something proving that she is entitled to it, it  seems to me that what remains of my father's estate is legally mine.
 Of  course, if it develops that he has made any special provision for her,  she shall have it; otherwise, Katy, we'll be in a position to install  you as housekeeper and put some light-footed, capable young person under  you for a step-saver in any direction you want to use her.
 It means,  too, that I shall be able to repay your loan immediately and to do the  things that I wanted to do about the house.
"    "Now I ain't in any hurry about that money, lambie," said Katy; "and you  understand of course that the dress you're wearing' I am given' ye.
"    "Of course, old dear, and you should have seen Peter Morrison light up  and admire it.
 He thinks you have wonderful taste, Katy.
"    Katy threw up both her hands.
    "Oh, my Lord, lambie!" she cried, aghast.
 "Was you telling' him that the  dress ye were wearing' was a present from your old cook?"    "Why, certainly I was," said Linda, wide eyed with astonish meet.
 "Why  shouldn't I? I was proud to.
 And now, old dear, before I go, the biggest  secret of all.
 I had a letter, Katy, from the editor of Everybody's  Home, and people like our articles, Katy; they are something now and  folk are letting the editor know about it, and he wants all I can send  him.
 He likes the pictures I make; and, Katy, you won't believe it till  I show you my little bank book, but for the three already published  with their illustrations he pays me five hundred nice, long, smooth,  beautifully decorated, paper dollars!"    "Judas praste!" cried Katy, her hands once more aloft.
 "Ye ain't manin'  it, lambie?"    "Yes, I are," laughed Linda.
 "I've got the money; and for each  succeeding three with their pictures I am to have that much more, and  when I finish--now steady yourself, Katy, because this is going to be a  shock--when I finish, blessed old dear heart, he is going to make them  into a book! That will be my job for this summer, and you shall help me,  and it will be a part of our great secret.
 Won't it be the most fun?"    "My soul!" said Katy.
 "You're jist crazy.
 I don't belave a word you're  telling' me.
"    "But I can prove it, because I have the letter and the bank book," said  Linda.
    Katy threw her arms around the girl and kissed the top of her head and  cried over her and laughed at the same time and patted her and petted  her and ended by saying: "Oh, lambie, if only the master could be  knowin' it.
"    "But he does know, Katy," said Linda.
    She went to her room, removed the beautiful dress and, arranging it on  a hanger, left it in her closet.
 Slipping into an old dressing gown, she  ran to her workroom and wrote a letter to Marian from herself.
 She tried  not to tell Marian the big, vital thing that was throbbing in her  heart all day concerning her work, the great secret that meant such  a wonderful thing to her, the thing that was beating in her heart and  fluttering behind her lips like a bird trying to escape its cage;  but she could tell her in detail of Eileen's undoubted removal to San  Francisco; she could tell her enough of the financial transactions of  the day to make her understand what had been happening in the past; and  she could tell of her latest interview with John Gilman.
 Once, as she  sat with her pen poised, thinking how to phrase a sentence, Linda said  to herself: "I wonder in my heart if he won't try to come crawfishing  back to Marian now, and if he does, I wonder, oh, how I wonder, what she  will do.
" Linda shut her lips very tight and stared up through her  skylight to the stars, as she was fast falling into a habit of doing  when she wanted inspiration.
    "Well, I know one thing," she said to the shining things above her,  "Marian will do as she sees fit, of course, but if it were I, and any  man had discarded me as John Gilman discarded Marian, in case he ever  wanted to pick me up again he would find I was not there.
 Much as I plan  in my heart for the home and the man and the little people that I  hope to have some day, I would give up all of them before I would be  discarded and re-sought like that; and knowing Marian as I do, I have  a conviction that she will feel the same way.
 From the things she is  writing about this Snow man I think it is highly probable that he may  awake some day to learn that he is not so deeply grieved but that he  would like to have Marian to comfort him in his loneliness; and as for  his little girl I don't see where he could find a woman who would rear  her more judiciously and beautifully than Marian would.
"    She finished her letter, sealed and stamped it, and then, taking out  a fresh sheet, she lettered in at the top of it, "INDIAN POTATOES" and  continued:    And very good potatoes they are.
 You will find these growing everywhere  throughout California, blooming from May to July, their six long,  slender, white petals shading to gold at the base, grayish on the  outside, a pollen-laden pistil upstanding, eight or ten gold-clubbed  stamens surrounding it, the slender brown stem bearing a dozen or more  of these delicate blooms, springing high from a base of leaves sometimes  nearly two feet long and an inch broad, wave margined, spreading in a  circle around it.
 In the soil of the plains and the dry hillsides you  will find an amazingly large solid bulb, thickly enwrapped in a coat  of brown fiber, the long threads of which can be braided, their amazing  strength making them suitable for bow strings, lariats, or rope of any  kind that must needs be improvised for use at the moment.
 The bulbs  themselves have many uses.
 Crushed and rubbed up in water they make a  delightful cleansing lather.
 The extracted juice, when cooked down, may  be used as glue.
 Of the roasted bulbs effective poultices for bruises  and boils may be made.
 It was an Indian custom to dam a small stream and  throw in mashed Amole bulbs, the effect of which was to stupefy the fish  so that they could be picked out by hand; all of which does not make it  appear that the same bulb would serve as an excellent substitute for a  baked potato; but we must remember how our grandmothers made starch from  our potatoes, used them to break in the new ironware, and to purify the  lard; which goes to prove that one vegetable may be valuable for  many purposes.
 Amole, whose ponderous scientific name is Chlorogalum  pomeridiarum, is at its best for my purposes when all the chlorophyll  from flower and stem has been driven back to the bulb, and it lies ripe  and fully matured from late August until December.
    Remove the fibrous cover down to the second or third layer enclosing the  bulb.
 These jackets are necessary as they keep the bulbs from drying out  and having a hard crust.
 Roast them exactly as you would potatoes.
 When  they can easily be pierced with a silver fork remove from the oven,  and serve immediately with any course with which you would use baked  potatoes.
    "And gee, but they're good!" commented Linda as she reread what she had  written.
    After that she turned her attention to drawing a hillside whitened  here and there with amole bloom showing in its purity against the warm  grayish-tan background.
 The waving green leaves ran among big rocks  and overlapped surrounding growth.
 At the right of her drawing Linda  sketched in a fine specimen of monkey flower, deepening the yellow from  the hearts of the amole lilies for the almost human little monkey  faces.
 On the left one giant specimen of amole, reared from a base of  exquisitely waving leaves, ran up the side of the drawing and broke into  an airy and graceful head of gold-hearted white lilies.
 For a long time  Linda sat with poised pencil, studying her foreground.
 What should she  introduce that would be most typical of the location and gave her the  desired splash of contrasting color that she used as a distinctive touch  in the foreground of all her drawings?    Her pencil flew busily a few minutes while she sketched in a flatly  growing bush of prickly phlox, setting the flower faces as closely  as the overlapped scales of a fish, setting them even as they grow in  nature; and when she resorted to the color box she painted these faces  a wonderful pink that was not wild rose, not cerise, not lilac, but  it made one think of all of them.
 When she could make no further  improvement on this sketch, she carefully stretched it against the wall  and tacked it up to dry.
    Afterward she cleared her mental decks of all the work she could think  of in order to have Saturday free, because Saturday was the day upon  which she found herself planning in the back of her mind throughout  the strenuous week, to save for riding the King's Highway with Donald  Whiting.
 Several times she had met him on the walks or in the hallways,  and always he had stopped to speak with her and several times he had  referred to the high hope in which he waited for Saturday.
 Linda already  had held a consultation with Katy on the subject of the lunch basket.
  That matter being satisfactorily arranged, there was nothing for her  to do but to double on her work so that Saturday would be free.
 Friday  evening Linda was called from the dinner table to the telephone.
 She  immediately recognized the voice inquiring for her as that of Judge  Whiting, and then she listened breathlessly while he said to her: "You  will recognize that there is very little I may say over a telephone  concerning a matter to which you brought my attention.
 I have a very  competent man looking into the matter thoroughly, and I find that  your fear is amply justified.
 Wherever you go or whatever you do, use  particular care.
 Don't have anything to do with any stranger.
 Just use  what your judgment and common sense tell you is a reasonable degree of  caution in every direction no matter how trivial.
 You understand?"    "I do," said Linda promptly.
 "Would you prefer that we do not go on any  more Saturday trips at present?"    The length of time that the Judge waited to answer proved that he had  taken time to think.
    "I can't see," he said finally, "that you would not be safer on such a  trip where you are moving about, where no one knows who you are, than  you would where you are commonly found.
"    "All right then," said Linda.
 "Ask the party we are considering and he  will tell you where he will be tomorrow.
 Thank you very much for letting  me know.
 If anything should occur, you will understand that it was  something quite out of my range of fore-sight.
"    "I understand," said the Judge.
    With all care and many loving admonitions Katy assisted in the start  made early Saturday morning.
 The previous Saturday Linda had felt that  all nature along the road she planned to drive would be at its best,  but they had not gone far until she modified her decision.
 They were  slipping through mists of early morning, over level, carefully made  roads like pavilion floors.
 If any one objection could have been made,  it would have been that the mists of night were weighting too heavily to  earth the perfume from the blooming orchards and millions of flowers in  gardens and along the roadside.
 At that hour there were few cars abroad.
  Linda was dressed in her outing suit of dark green.
 She had removed  her hat and slipped it on the seat beside her.
 She looked at Donald, a  whimsical expression on her most expressive young face.
    "Please to 'scuse me," she said lightly, "if I step on the gas a mite  while we have the road so much to ourselves and are so familiar with  it.
 Later, when we reach stranger country and have to share with others,  we'll be forced to go slower.
"    "Don't stint your speed on account of me," said Donald.
 "I am just  itching to know what Kitty can do.
"    "All right, here's your chance," said Linda.
 "Hear her purr?"    She settled her body a trifle tensely, squared her shoulders, and  gripped the steering wheel.
 Then she increased the gas and let the Bear  Cat roll over the smooth road from Lilac Valley running south into  Los Angeles.
 At a speed that was near to flying as a non-professional  attains, the youngsters traveled that road.
 Their eyes were shining;  their blood was racing.
 Until the point where rougher roads and  approaching traffic forced them to go slower, they raced, and when they  slowed down they looked at each other and laughed in morning delight.
    "I may not be very wise," said Linda, "but didn't I do the smartest  thing when I let Eileen have the touring car and saved the Bear Cat for  us?"    "Nothing short of inspiration," said Donald.
 "The height of my ambition  is to own a Bear Cat.
 If Father makes any mention of anything I would  like particularly to have for a graduation present, I am cocked and  primed as to what I shall tell him.
"    "You'd better save yourself a disappointment," said Linda soberly.
 "You  will be starting to college this fall, and when you do you will be gone  nine months out of the year, and I am fairly sure your father wouldn't  think shipping a Bear Cat back and forth a good investment, or  furnishing you one to take to school with you.
 He would fear you would  never make a grade that would be a credit to him if he did.
"    "My!" laughed Donald, "you've got a long head on your shoulders!"    "When you're thrown on your own for four of the longest, lonesomest  years of your life, you learn to think," said Linda soberly.
    She was touching the beginning of Los Angeles traffic.
 Later she was on  the open road again.
 The mists were thinning and lifting.
 The perfume  was not so heavy.
 The sheeted whiteness of the orange groves was broken  with the paler white of plum merging imperceptibly into the delicate  pink of apricot and the stronger pink of peach, and there were deep  green orchards of smooth waxen olive foliage and the lacy-leaved  walnuts.
 Then came the citrus orchards again, and all the way on either  hand running with them were almost uninterrupted miles of roses of every  color and kind, and everywhere homes ranging from friendly mansions, all  written over in adorable flower color with the happy invitation, "Come  in and make yourself at home," to tiny bungalows along the wayside  crying welcome to this gay pair of youngsters in greetings fashioned  from white and purple wisteria, gold bignonia, every rose the world  knows, and myriad brilliant annual and perennial flower faces gathered  from the circumference of the tropical globe and homing enthusiastically  on the King's Highway.
 Sometimes Linda lifted her hand from the wheel  to wave a passing salute to a particularly appealing flower picture.
  Sometimes she whistled a note or cried a greeting to a mockingbird, a  rosy finch, or a song sparrow.
    "Look at the pie timber!" she cried to Donald, calling his attention  to a lawn almost covered with red-winged blackbirds.
 "Four hundred and  twenty might be baked in that pie," she laughed.
    Then a subtle change began to creep over the world.
 The sun peered over  the mountains inquiringly, a timid young thing, as if she were asking  what degree of light and warmth they would like for the day.
 A new  brilliancy tinged every flower face in this light, a throbbing ecstasy  mellowed every bird note; the orchards dropped farther apart, meadows  filled with grazing cattle flashed past them, the earthy scent of  freshly turned fields mingled with flower perfume, and on their right  came drifting in a cool salt breath from the sea.
 At mid-forenoon, as  they neared Laguna, they ran past great hills, untouched since the days  when David cried: "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence  cometh my help.
" At one particularly beautiful range, draped with the  flowing emerald of spring, decorated with beds of gold poppy, set with  flowering madrona and manzanita, with the gold of yellow monkey flower  or the rich red of the related species, with specimens of lupin growing  in small trees, here and there adventurous streams singing and flashing  their unexpected way to the mother breast of the waiting ocean very  near to the road which at one surprising turn carried them to the  never-ending wonder of the troubled sea, they drove as slowly as  the Bear Cat would consent to travel, so that they might study great  boulders, huge as many of the buildings they had passed, their faces  scarred by the wrack of ages.
 Studying their ancient records one  could see that they had been familiar with the star that rested over  Bethlehem.
 On their faces had shone the same moon that opened the  highways Journeying into Damascus.
 They had stood the storms that had  beaten upon the world since the days when the floods subsided, the  land lifted above the face of the waters in gigantic upheavals that had  ripped the surface of the globe from north to south and forced up the  hills, the foothills, and the mountains of the Coast Range.
 They had  been born then, they had first seen the light of day, in glowing,  molten, red-hot, high-piled streams of lava that had gushed forth in  that awful evolution of birth.
    Sometimes Linda stopped the car, they left it, and climbed over the  faces of these mighty upheavals.
 Once Linda reached her hand to Donald  and cried, half laughingly, half in tense earnest: "Oh, kid, we have got  to hurry.
 Compared with the age of these, we've only a few minutes.
 It's  all right to talk jestingly about 'the crack of doom' but you know  there really was a crack of doom, and right here is where it cracked and  spewed out the material that hardened into these very rocks.
 Beside them  I feel as a shrimp must feel beside a whale, and I feel that we must  hurry.
"    "And so we must," said Donald.
 "I'm hungry as Likeliest when he waited  for them to find enough peacock tongues to satisfy his appetite.
"    "I wonder what brand of home-brew made him think of that," said Linda.
    "Well, you know," said Donald, "the world was only a smallish place  then.
 They didn't have to go far to find everything to which they had  access, and it must have been rather a decent time in which to live.
  Awful lot of light and color and music and unique entertainment.
"    "You're talking," said Linda, "from the standpoint of the king or the  master.
 Suppose you had lived then and had been the slave.
"    "There you go again," said Donald, "throwing a brick into the most  delicate mechanism of my profound thought.
 You ought to be ashamed to  round me up with something scientific and materialistic every time I go  a-glimmering.
 Don't you think this would be a fine place to have lunch?"    "You wait and see where we lunch today, and you will have the answer to  that," said Linda, starting back to the Bear Cat.
    A few miles farther on they followed the road around the frowning menace  of an overhanging rock and sped out directly to the panorama of the sea.
  The sun was shining on it, but, as always round the Laguna shore, the  rip tide was working itself into undue fury.
 It came dashing up on the  ancient rocks until one could easily understand why a poet of long  ago wrote of sea horses.
 Some of the waves did suggest monstrous white  chargers racing madly to place their feet upon the solid rock.
    Through the village, up the steep inclines, past placid lakes, past  waving yellow mustard beds, beside highways where the breastplate of  Mother Earth gleamed emerald and ruby against the background of billions  of tiny, shining diamonds of the iceplant, past the old ostrich tree  reproduced by etchers of note the world over, with grinding brakes,  sliding down the breathless declivity leading to the shore, Linda  stopped at last where the rock walls lifted sheer almost to the sky.
 She  led Donald to a huge circle carpeted with cerise sand verbena, with  pink and yellow iceplant bloom, with jewelled iceplant foliage, with the  running blue of the lovely sea daisy, with the white and pink of the  sea fig, where the walls were festooned with ferns, lichens, studded all  over with flaming Our Lord's Candles, and strange, uncanny, grotesque  flower forms, almost human in their writhing turns as they twisted  around the rocks and slipped along clinging to the sheer walls.
 Just  where the vegetation met the white, sea-washed sand, Linda spread  the Indian blanket, and Donald brought the lunch box.
 At their feet  adventurous waves tore themselves to foam on the sharp rocks.
 On their  left they broke in booming spray, tearing and fretting the base of  cliffs that had stood impregnable through aeons of such ceaseless attack  and repulse.
    "I wonder," said Donald, "how it comes that I have lived all my life in  California, and today it seems to me that most of the worthwhile things  I know about her I owe to you.
 When I go to college this winter the  things I shall be telling the boys will be how I could gain a living, if  I had to, on the desert, in Death Valley, from the walls of Multiflores  Canyon; and how the waves go to smash on the rocks of Laguna, not to  mention cactus fish hooks, mescal sticks, and brigand beefsteak.
 It's  no wonder the artists of all the world come here copying these pictures.
  It's no wonder they build these bungalows and live here for years,  unsatisfied with their efforts to reproduce the pictures of the Master  Painter of them all.
"    "I wonder," said Linda, "if anybody is very easily satisfied.
 I wonder  today if Eileen is satisfied with being merely rich.
 I wonder if we  are satisfied to have this golden day together.
 I wonder if the white  swallows are satisfied with the sea.
 I wonder if those rocks are  satisfied and proud to stand impregnable against the constant torment of  the tide.
"    "I wonder, oh, Lord, how I wonder," broke in Donald, "about Katherine  O'Donovan's lunch box.
 If you want a picture of per feet satisfaction,  Belinda beloved, lead me to it!"    "Thank heaven you're mistaken," she said; "they spared me the 'Be'--.
  It's truly just 'Linda.
"'    "Well, I'm not sparing you the 'Be--'," said Donald, busy with the  fastenings of the lunch basket.
 "Did you hear where I used it?"    "Yes, child, and I like it heaps," said Linda casually.
 "It's fine to  have you like me.
 Awfully proud of myself.
"    "You have two members of our family at your feet," said Donald soberly  as he handed her packages from the box.
 "My dad is beginning to  discourse on you with such signs of intelligence that I am almost led  to believe, from some of his wildest outbursts, that he has had some  personal experience in some way.
"    "And why not?" asked Linda lightly.
 "Haven't I often told you that my  father constantly went on fishing and hunting trips, that he was a great  collector of botanical specimens, that he frequently took his friends  with him? You might ask your father if he does not recall me as having  fried fish and made coffee and rendered him camp service when I was a  slip of a thing in the dawn of my teens.
"    "Well, he didn't just mention it," said Donald, "but I can easily see  how it might have been.
"    After they had finished one of Katy's inspired lunches, in which a large  part of the inspiration had been mental on Linda's part and executive on  Katy's, they climbed rock faces, skirted wave-beaten promontories, and  stood peering from overhanging cliffs dipping down into the fathomless  green sea, where the water boiled up in turbulent fury.
 Linda pointed  out the rocks upon which she would sit, if she were a mermaid, to comb  the seaweed from her hair.
 She could hear the sea bells ringing in those  menacing depths, but Donald's ears were not so finely tuned.
 At the top  of one of the highest cliffs they climbed, there grew a clump of slender  pale green bushes, towering high above their heads with exquisitely  cut blue-green leaves, lance shaped and slender.
 Donald looked at the  fascinating growth appraisingly.
    "Linda," he said, "do you know that the slimness and the sheerness and  the audacious foothold and the beauty of that thing remind me of you?  It is covered all over with the delicate frostbloom you taught me to see  upon fruit.
 I find it everywhere but you have never told me what it is.
"    Linda laughingly reached up and broke a spray of greenish-yellow tubular  flowers, curving out like clustered trumpets spilling melody from their  fluted throats.
    "You will see it everywhere.
 You will find these flowers every month  of the year," she said, "and I am particularly gladsome that this plant  reminds you of me.
 I love the bluish-green 'bloom' of its sheer foliage.
  I love the music these flower trumpets make to me.
 I love the way it  has traveled, God knows how, all the way from the Argentine and spread  itself over our country wherever it is allowed footing.
 I am glad that  there is soothing in these dried leaves for those who require it.
 I  shall be delighted to set my seal on you with it.
 There are two little  Spanish words that it suggests to the Mexican--Buena moza--but you shall  find out for yourself what they mean.
"    Encountering his father that night at his library door, Donald Whiting  said to him: "May I come in, Dad? I have something I must look up before  I sleep.
 Have you a Spanish lexicon, or no doubt you have this in your  head.
"    "Well, I've a halting vocabulary," said the Judge.
 "What's your phrase?"    "Linda put this flower on me today," said Donald, "and she said she was  pleased because I said the tall, slender bush it grew on reminded me  of her.
 She gave me the Spanish name, but I don't know the exact  significance of the decoration I am wearing until I learn the meaning of  the phrase.
"    "Try me on it," said the Judge.
    "'Buena moza,'" quoted Donald.
    The Judge threw back his head and laughed heartily.
    "Son," he said, "you should know that from the Latin you're learning.
  You should translate it instinctively.
 I couldn't tell you exactly  whether a Spaniard would translate 'Buena' 'fine' or 'good.
' Knowing  their high-falutin' rendition of almost everything else I would take my  chance on 'fine.
' Son, your phrase means 'a fine girl.
'"    Donald looked down at the flower in his buttonhole, and then he looked  straight at his father.
    "And only the Lord knows, Dad," he said soberly, "exactly how fine  Linda-girl is.
"        .
 A Mouse Nest    LINDA DEAREST:    I am delighted that you had such a wonderful birthday.
 I would take a  shot in air that anything you don't understand about it you might with  reasonable safety charge to Katherine O'Donovan.
 I think it was great  of her to have a suitable and a becoming dress waiting for you and a  congenial man like Peter Morrison to dine with you.
 He appealed to me as  being a rare character, highly original, and, I should think, to those  who know him well he must be entertaining and lovable in the extreme.
  I never shall be worried about you so long as I know that he is taking  care of you.
    I should not be surprised if some day I meet Eileen somewhere, because  Dana and I are going about more than you would believe possible.
 I  heartily join with you in wishing her every good that life can bring  her.
 I don't want to be pessimistic, but I can't help feeling, Linda,  that she is taking a poor way to win the best, and I gravely doubt  whether she finds it in the spending of unlimited quantities of the  money of a coarse man who stumbled upon his riches accidentally, as has  many a man of California and Colorado.
    I intended, when I sat down to write, the very first thing I said,  to thank you for your wonderful invitation, seconded so loyally and  cordially by Katy, to make my home with you until the time comes--if it  ever does come--when I shall have a home of my own again.
 And just  as simply and wholeheartedly as you made the offer, I accept it.
 I am  enclosing the address and the receipt for my furniture in storage, and a  few lines ordering it delivered at your house and the bill sent to me.
  I only kept a few heirlooms and things of Mother's and Father's that are  very precious to me.
 Whenever Eileen takes her things you can order mine  in and let me know, and I'll take a day or two off and run down for a  short visit.
    Mentioning Eileen makes me think of John.
 I think of him more frequently  than I intend or wish that I did, but I feel my ninth life is now  permanently extinguished concerning him.
 I thought I detected in your  letter, Linda dear, a hint of fear that he might come back to me and  that I might welcome him.
 If you have any such feeling in your heart,  abandon it, child, because, while I try not to talk about myself, I do  want to say that I rejoice in a family inheritance of legitimate pride.
  I couldn't give the finest loyalty and comradeship I had to give to a  man, have it returned disdainfully, and then furbish up the pieces and  present it over again.
 If I can patch those same pieces and so polish  and refine them that I can make them, in the old phrase, "as good as  new," possibly in time--but, Linda, one thing is certain as the hills  of morning.
 Never in my life will any man make any headway with me again  with vague suggestions and innuendoes and hints.
 If ever any man wants  to be anything in my life, he will speak plainly and say what he wants  and thinks and hopes and intends and feels in not more than two-syllable  English.
 I learned my lesson about the futility of building your house  of dreams on a foundation of sand.
 Next time I erect a dream house, it  is going to have a proper foundation of solid granite.
 And that may seem  a queer thing for me to say when you know that I am getting the joy in  my life, that I do not hesitate to admit I am, from letters written by a  man whose name I don't know.
 It may be that I don't know the man, but I  certainly am very well acquainted with him, and in some way he seems to  me to be taking on more definite form.
 I should not be surprised if I  were to recognize him the first time I met him face to face.
    Linda looked through the skylight and cried out to the stars: "Good  heavens! Have I copied Peter too closely?"    She sat thinking a minute and then she decided she had not.
    And in this connection you will want to know how I am progressing in  my friendship with the junior partner, and what kind of motorist I am  making.
 I am still driving twice a week, and lately on Sundays in a  larger car, taking Dana and a newspaper friend of hers along.
 I think I  have driven every hazard that this part of California affords except the  mountains; Mr. Snow is still merciful about them.
    Linda dear, I know what you're dying to know.
 You want to know whether  Mr. Snow is in the same depths of mourning as when our acquaintance  first began.
 This, my dear child, is very reprehensible of you.
 Young  girls with braids down their backs--and by the way, Linda, you did not  tell me what happened "after the ball was over.
" Did you go to school  the next morning with braids down your back, or wearing your coronet?  Because on that depends what I have to say to you now; if you went with  braids, you're still my little girl chum, the cleanest, finest kid I  have ever known; but if you wore your coronet, then you're a woman and  my equal and my dearest friend, far dearer than Dana even; and I tell  you this, Linda, because I want you always to understand that you come  first.
    I have tried and tried to visualize you, and can't satisfy my mind as to  whether the braids are up or down.
 Going on the assumption that they are  up, and that life may in the near future begin to hold some interesting  experiences for you, I will tell you this, beloved child: I don't think  Mr. Snow is mourning quite so deeply as he was.
 I have not been asked,  the last four or five trips we have been on, to carry an armload  of exquisite flowers to the shrine of a departed love.
 I have been  privileged to take them home and arrange them in my room and Dana's.
 And  I haven't heard so much talk about loneliness, and I haven't seen such  tired, sad eyes.
 It seems to me that a familiar pair of shoulders  are squaring up to the world again, and a very kind pair of eyes are  brighter with interest.
 I don't know how you feel about this; I don't  know how I feel about it myself.
 I am sure that Eugene Snow is a man  who, in the years to come, would line up beside your father and mine,  and I like him immensely.
 It is merely a case of not liking him  less, but of liking my unknown man more.
 I couldn't quite commit the  sacrilege, Linda dear, of sending you a sample of the letters I am  receiving, but they are too fanciful and charming for any words of mine  to describe adequately.
 I don't know who this man is, or what he has to  offer, or whether he intends to offer anything, but it is a ridiculous  fact, Linda, that I would rather sit with him in a chimney corner  of field boulders, on a pine floor, with a palm roof and an Ocotillo  candle, than to glow in the parchment-shielded electric light of the  halls of a rich man.
 In a recent letter, Linda, there was a reference  to a woman who wore "a diadem of crystallized light.
" It was a beautiful  thing and I could not help taking it personally.
 It was his way of  telling me that he knew me, and knew my tragedy; and, as I said before,  I am beginning to feel that I have him rather definitely located; and I  can understand the fine strain in him that prompted his anonymity, and  his reasons for it.
 Of course I am not sufficiently confident yet to  say anything definite, but my heart is beginning to say things that I  sincerely hope my lips never will be forced to deny.
    Linda laid down the letter, folded her hands across it, and once more  looked at the stars.
    "Good gracious!" she said.
 "I am tincturing those letters with too  much Peter.
 I'll have to tone down a bit.
 Next thing I know she will  be losing her chance with that wonderful Snow man for a dream.
 In my  efforts to comfort her I must have gone too far.
 It is all right  to write a gushy love letter and stuff it full of Peter's whimsical  nonsense, but, in the language of the poet, how am I going to 'deliver  the goods'? Of course that talk about Louise Whiting was all well  enough.
 Equally, of course, I outlined and planted the brook and  designed the bridge for Marian, whether she knows it or Peter knows it,  or not.
 If they don't know it, it's about time they were finding it out.
  I think it's my job to visit Peter more frequently and see if I can't  invent some way to make him see the light.
 I will give Katy a hint in  the morning.
 Tomorrow evening I'll go up and have supper with him and  see if he has another article in the stewpan.
 I like this work with  Peter.
 I like having him make me dream dreams and see pictures.
 I like  the punch and the virility he puts into my drawings.
 It's all right  reproducing monkey flowers and lilies for pastime, but for serious  business, for real life work, I would rather do Peter's brainstorming,  heart-thrilling pictures than my merely pretty ones.
 On the subject of  Peter, I must remember in the morning to take those old books he gave me  to Donald.
 I believe that from one of them he is going to get the very  material he needs to down the Jap in philosophy.
 And they are not text  books which proves that Peter must have been digging into the subject  and hunted them up in some second-hand store, or even sent away an order  for them.
"    In the hall the next morning Linda stopped Donald and gave him the  books.
 In the early stages of their friendship she had looked at him  under half-closed lids and waited to see whether he intended stopping to  say a word with her when they passed each other or came down the halls  together.
 She knew that their acquaintance would be noted and commented  upon, and she knew how ready the other girls would be to say that  she was bold and forward, so she was careful to let Donald make the  advances, until he had called to her so often, and had dug flowers and  left his friends waiting at her door while he delivered them, that  she felt free to address him as she chose.
 He had shown any interested  person in the high school that he was her friend, that he was speaking  to her exactly as he did to girls he had known from childhood.
 He was  very popular among the boys and girls of his class and the whole school.
  His friendship, coming at the time of Linda's rebellion on the subject  of clothes, had developed a tendency to bring her other friendships.
  Boys who never had known she was in existence followed Donald's example  in stopping her to say a word now and then.
 Girls who had politely  ignored her now found things to say; and several invitations she had  not had leisure to accept had been sent to her for afternoon and evening  entertainments among the young people.
 Linda had laid out for herself  something of a task in deciding to be the mental leader of her class.
  There were good brains in plenty among the other pupils.
 It was only by  work, concentration, and purpose, only by having a mind keenly alert,  by independent investigation and introducing new points of view that she  could hold her prestige.
 Up to the receipt of her letter containing the  offer to publish her book she had been able rigorously to exclude from  her mind the personality and the undertakings of Jane Meredith.
 She was  Linda Strong in the high school and for an hour or two at her studies.
  She was Jane Meredith over the desert, through the canyons, beside the  sea, in her Multiflores kitchen or in Katherine O'Donovan's.
 But this  book offer opened a new train of thought, a new series of plans.
 She  could see her way--thanks to her father she had the material in her mind  and the art in her finger tips--to materialize what she felt would be  even more attractive in book form than anything her editor had been able  to visualize from her material.
 She knew herself, she knew her territory  so minutely.
 Frequently she smiled when she read statements in her  botanies as to where plants and vegetables could be found.
 She knew the  high home of the rare and precious snow plant.
 She knew the northern  limit of the strawberry cactus.
 She knew where the white sea swallow  nested.
 She knew where the Monarch butterfly went on his winter  migration.
 She knew where the trap-door spider, with cunning past  the cunning of any other architect of Nature, built his small, round,  silken-lined tower and hinged his trap door so cleverly that only he  could open it from the outside.
 She had even sat immovable and watched  him erect his house, and she would have given much to see him weave its  silver lining.
    Linda was fast coming to the place where she felt herself to be one in  an interested group of fellow workers.
 She no longer gave a thought to  what kind of shoes she wore.
 Other girls were beginning to wear the  same kind.
 The legislatures of half a dozen states were passing  laws regulating the height of heel which might be worn within their  boundaries.
 Manufacturers were promising for the coming season that  suitable shoes would be built for street wear and mountain climbing, for  the sands of the sea and the sands of the desert, and the sheer face of  canyons.
 The extremely long, dirt-sweeping skirts were coming up; the  extremely short, immodest skirts were coming down.
 A sane and sensible  wave seemed to be sweeping the whole country.
 Under the impetus of  Donald Whiting's struggles to lead his classes and those of other  pupils to lead theirs a higher grade of scholarship was beginning to be  developed throughout the high school.
 Pupils were thinking less of what  they wore and how much amusement they could crowd in, and more about  making grades that would pass them with credit from year to year.
 The  horrors of the war and the disorders following it had begun to impress  upon the young brains growing into maturity the idea that soon it would  be their task to take over the problems that were now vexing the world's  greatest statesmen and its wisest and most courageous women.
 A tendency  was manifesting itself among young people to equip themselves to take a  worthy part in the struggles yet to come.
 Classmates who had looked with  toleration upon Linda's common-sense shoes and plain dresses because  she was her father's daughter, now looked upon her with respect and  appreciation because she started so many interesting subjects for  discussion, because she was so rapidly developing into a creature well  worth looking at.
 Always she would be unusual because of her extreme  height, her narrow eyes, her vivid coloring.
 But a greater maturity, a  fuller figure, had come to be a part of the vision with which one looked  at Linda.
 In these days no one saw her as she was.
 Even her schoolmates  had fallen into the habit of seeing her as she would be in the years to  come.
    Thus far she had been able to keep her identities apart without any  difficulty; but the book proposition was so unexpected, it was such a  big thing to result from her modest beginning, that Linda realized  that she must proceed very carefully, she must concentrate with all her  might, else her school work would begin to suffer in favor of the book.
  Recently so many things had arisen to distract her attention.
 Many days  she had not been able to keep Eileen's face off her geometry papers;  and again she saw Gilman's, anxious and pain-filled.
 Sometimes she found  herself lifting her eyes from tasks upon which she was concentrating  with all her might, and with no previous thought whatever she was  searching for Donald Whiting, and when she saw him, coming into muscular  and healthful manhood, she returned to her work with more strength,  deeper vision, a quiet, assured feeling around her heart.
 Sometimes,  over the edge of Literature and Ancient History, Peter Morrison looked  down at her with gravely questioning eyes and dancing imps twisting his  mouth muscles, and Linda paused a second to figure upon what had become  an old problem with her.
 Why did her wild-flower garden make Peter  Morrison think of a graveyard? What was buried there besides the feet of  her rare flowers? She had not as yet found the answer.
    This day her thoughts were on Peter frequently because she intended to  see him that night.
 She was going to share with him a supper of baked  ham and beans and bread and butter and pickled onions and little nut  cakes, still warm from Katy's oven.
 She was going to take Katy with her  in order that she might see Peter Morrison's location and the house for  his dream lady, growing at the foot of the mountain like a gay orchid  homing on a forest tree.
 To Linda it was almost a miracle, the rapidity  with which a house could be erected in California.
 In a few weeks' time  she had seen a big cellar scooped out of the plateau, had seen it lined  and rising to foundation height above the surface in solid concrete,  faced outside with cracked boulders.
 She had seen a framework erected,  a rooftree set, and joists and rafters and beams swinging into place.
  Fretworks of lead and iron pipe were running everywhere, and wires for  electricity.
 Soon shingles and flooring would be going into place, and  Peter said that when he had finished acrobatic performances on beams  and girders and really stepped out on solid floors where he might tread  without fear of breaking any of his legs, he would perform a Peacock  Dance all by himself.
    "Peter, you sound like a centipede," said Linda.
    "Dear child," said Peter, "when I enter my front door and get to the  back on two-inch footing, I positively feel that I have numerous legs,  and I ache almost as badly in the fear that I shall break the two I  have, as I should if they were really broken.
"    And then he added a few words on a subject of which he had not before  spoken to Linda.
    "It was like that in France.
 When we really got into the heat of things  and the work was actually being done, we were not afraid: we were too  busy; we were 'supermen.
' The time when we were all legs and arms and  head, and all of them were being blown away wholesale was when the  shells whined over while we had a rest hour and were trying to sleep,  or in the cold, dim dawn when we stumbled out stiff, hungry, and sleepy.
  It's not the REAL THING when it's really occurring that gets one.
 It's  the devils of imagination tormenting the soul.
 There is only one thing  in this world can happen to me that is really going to be as bad as the  things I dream.
"    Linda looked down Lilac Valley, her eyes absently focusing on Katy  busily setting supper on a store box in front of the garage.
 Then she  looked at Peter.
    "Mind telling?" she inquired lightly.
    Peter looked at her speculatively.
    "And would a man be telling his heart's best secret to a kid like you?"  he asked.
    "Now, I call that downright mean," said Linda.
 "Haven't you noticed that  my braids are up? Don't you see a maturity and a dignity and a general  matronliness apparent all over me today?"    "Matronliness" was too much for Peter.
 You could have heard his laugh  far down the blue valley.
    "That's good!" he cried.
    "It is," agreed Linda.
 "It means that my braids are up to stay, so  hereafter I'm a real woman.
"    She lingered over the word an instant, glancing whimsically at Peter,  a trace of a smile on her lips, then she made her way down a slant  declivity and presently returned with an entire flower plant, new to  Peter and of unusual beauty.
    "And because I am a woman I shall set my seal upon you," she said.
    In the buttonhole of his light linen coat she placed a flower of satin  face of purest gold, the five petals rounded, but sharply tipped, a  heavy mass of silk stamens, pollen dusted in the heart.
 She pushed back  the left side of his coat and taking one of the rough, hairy leaves  of the plant she located it over Peter's heart, her slim, deft fingers  patting down the leaf and flattening it out until it lay pasted smooth  and tight.
 As she worked, she smiled at him challengingly.
 Peter knew he  was experiencing a ceremony of some kind, the significance of which he  must learn.
 It was the first time Linda had voluntarily touched him.
 He  breathed lightly and held steady, lest he startle her.
    "Lovely enough," he said, "to have come from the hills of the stars.
  Don't make me wait, Linda; help me to the interpretation.
"    "Buena Mujer," suggested Linda.
    "Good woman," translated Peter.
    Linda nodded, running a finger down the leaf over his heart.
    "Because she sticks close to you," she explained.
 Then startled by the  look in Peter's eyes, she cried in swift change: "Now we are all going  to work for a minute.
 Katy's spreading the lunch.
 You take this pail and  go to the spring for water and I shall tidy your quarters for you.
"    With the eye of experience Linda glanced over the garage deciding that  she must ask for clean sheets for the cot and that the Salvation Army  would like the heap of papers.
 Studying the writing table she heard a  faint sound that untrained ears would have missed.
    "Ah, ha, Ma wood mouse," said Linda, "nibbling Peter's dr.
 goods are  you?"    Her cry a minute later answered the question.
 She came from the garage  upon Katherine O'Donovan rushing to meet her, holding a man's coat at  the length of her far-reaching arm.
    "I wish you'd look at that pocket.
 I don't know how long this coat has  been hanging there, but there is a nest of field mice in it," she said.
    Katy promptly retreated to the improvised dining table, seated herself  upon an end of it, and raised both feet straight into the air.
    "Small help I'll be getting from you," said Linda laughingly.
    She went to the edge of the declivity that cut back to the garage and  with a quick movement reversed the coat catching it by the skirts and  shaking it vigorously.
        .
 The Straight and Narrow    This served exactly the purpose Linda had intended.
 It dislodged  the mouse nest and dropped it three feet below her level, but it did  something else upon which Linda had no time to count.
 It emptied every  pocket in the coat and sent the contents scattering down the rough  declivity.
    "Oh my gracious!" gasped Linda.
 "Look what I have done! Katy, come help  me quickly; I have to gather up this stuff; but it's no use; I'll have  to take it to Peter and tell him.
 I couldn't put these things back in  the pockets where his hand will reach for them, because I don't know  which came from inside and which came from out.
"    Linda sprang down and began hastily gathering up everything she could  see that had fallen from the coat pockets.
 She had almost finished when  her fingers chanced upon a very soiled, befigured piece of paper whose  impressed folds showed that it had been carried for some time in an  inner pocket.
 As her fingers touched this paper her eyes narrowed, her  breath came in a gasp.
 She looked at it a second, irresolute, then she  glanced over the top of the declivity in the direction Peter had taken.
  He was standing in front of the building, discussing some matter with  the contractor.
 He had not yet gone to the spring.
 Shielded by the  embankment with shaking fingers Linda opened the paper barely enough to  see that it was Marian's lost sheet of plans; but it was not as Marian  had lost it.
 It was scored deeply here and there with heavy lines  suggestive of alterations, and the margin was fairly covered with fine  figuring.
 Linda did not know Peter Morrison's writing or figures.
 His  articles had been typewritten and she had never seen his handwriting.
  She sat down suddenly on account of weakened knees, and gazed unseeingly  down the length of Lilac Valley, her heart sick, her brain tormented.
  Suddenly she turned and studied the house.
    "Before the Lord!" she gasped.
 "I THOUGHT there was something mighty  familiar even about the skeleton of you! Oh, Peter, Peter, where did you  get this, and how could you do it?"    For a while a mist blurred her eyes.
 She reached for the coat and  started to replace the things she had gathered up, then she shut her  lips tight.
    "Best time to pull a tooth," she said tersely to a terra cotta red  manzanita bush, "is when it aches.
"    When Peter returned from the spring he was faced by a trembling girl,  colorless and trying hard to keep her voice steady.
 She held out the  coat to him with one hand, the package of papers with the other, the  folded drawing conspicuous on the top.
 With these she gestured toward  the declivity.
    "Mouse nest in your pocket, Peter," she said thickly.
 "Reversed the coat  to shake it out, and spilled your stuff.
"    Then she waited for Peter to be confounded.
 But Peter was not in the  faintest degree troubled about either the coat or the papers.
 What did  trouble him was the face and the blazing eyes of the girl concerning  whom he would not admit, even to himself, his exact state of feeling.
    "The mouse did not get on you, Linda?" he asked anxiously.
    Linda shook her head.
 Suddenly she lost her self-control.
    "Oh, Peter," she wailed, "how could you do it?"    Peter's lean frame tensed suddenly.
    "I don't understand, Linda," he said quietly.
 "Exactly what have I  done?"    Linda thrust the coat and the papers toward him accusingly and stood  there wordless but with visible pain in her dark eyes.
 peter smiled at  her reassuringly.
    "That's not my coat, you know.
 If there is anything distressing about  it, don't lay it to me.
"    "Oh, Peter!" cried Linda, "tell the truth about it.
 Don't try any  evasions.
 I am so sick of them.
"    A rather queer light sprang into Peter's eyes.
 He leaned forward  suddenly and caught the coat from Linda's fingers.
    "Well, if you need an alibi concerning this coat," he said, "I think I  can furnish it speedily.
"    As he talked he whirled the garment around and shot his long arms into  the sleeves.
 Shaking it into place on his shoulders, he slowly turned in  front of Linda and the surprised Katy.
 The sleeves came halfway to his  wrists and the shoulders slid down over his upper arms.
 He made such a  quaint and ridiculous figure that Katy burst out laughing.
 She was very  well trained, but she knew Linda was deeply distressed.
    "Wake up, lambie!" she cried sharply.
 "That coat ain't belonging to  Mr. Pater Morrison.
 That gairment is the property of that bug-catchin'  architect of his.
"    Peter shook off the coat and handed it back to Linda.
    "Am I acquitted?" he asked lightly; but his surprised eyes were  searching her from braid to toe.
    Linda turned from him swiftly.
 She thrust the packet into a side pocket  and started to the garage with the coat.
 As she passed inside she  slipped down her hand, slid the sheet of plans from the other papers,  and slipped it into the front of her blouse.
 She hung the coat back  where she had found it, then suddenly sat down on the side of Peter  Morrison's couch, white and shaken.
 Peter thought he heard a peculiar  gasp and when he strayed past the door, casually glancing inward, he  saw what he saw, and it brought him to his knees beside Linda with all  speed.
    "Linda-girl," he implored, "what in this world has happened?"    Linda struggled to control her voice; but at last she buried her face  in her hands and frankly emitted a sound that she herself would have  described as "howling.
" Peter knelt back in wonder.
    "Of all the things I ever thought about you, Linda," he said, "the one  thing I never did think was that you were hysterical.
"    If there was one word in Linda's vocabulary more opprobrious than  "nerves," which could be applied to a woman, it was "hysterics.
" The  great specialist had admitted nerves; hysterics had no standing with  him.
 Linda herself had no more use for a hysterical woman than she had  for a Gila monster.
 She straightened suddenly, and in removing her hands  from her face she laid one on each of Peter's shoulders.
    "Oh, Peter," she wailed, "I am not a hysterical idiot, but I couldn't  have stood it if that coat had been yours.
 Peter, I just couldn't have  borne it!"    Peter held himself rigidly in the fear that he might disturb the hands  that were gripping him.
    "I see I have the job of educating these damned field mice as to where  they may build with impunity," he said soberly.
    But Linda was not to be diverted.
 She looked straight and deep into his  eyes.
    "Peter," she said affirmatively, "you don't know a thing about that  coat, do you?"    "I do not," said Peter promptly.
    "You never saw what was in its pockets, did you?"    "Not to my knowledge," answered Peter.
 "What was in the pockets, Linda?"    Linda thought swiftly.
 Peter adored his dream house.
 If she told him  that the plans for it had been stolen by his architect, the house would  be ruined for Peter.
 Anyone could see from the candor of his gaze and  the lines that God and experience had graven on his face that Peter was  without guile.
 Suddenly Linda shot her hands past Peter's shoulders and  brought them together on the back of his neck.
 She drew his face against  hers and cried: "Oh Peter, I would have been killed if that coat had  been yours.
 I tell you I couldn't have endured it, Peter.
 I am just  tickled to death!"    One instant she hugged him tight.
 If her lips did not brush his cheek,  Peter deluded himself.
 Then she sprang up and ran from the garage.
  Later he took the coat from its nail, the papers from its pockets, and  carefully looked them over.
 There was nothing among them that would  give him the slightest clue to Linda's conduct.
 He looked again,  penetratingly, searchingly, for he must learn from them a reason; and  no reason was apparent.
 With the coat in one hand and the papers in the  other he stepped outside.
    "Linda," he said, "won't you show me? Won't you tell me? What is there  about this to upset you?"    Linda closed her lips and shook her head.
 Once more Peter sought in her  face, in her attitude the information he craved.
    "Needn't tell me," he said, "that a girl who will face the desert and  the mountains and the canyons and the sea is upset by a mouse.
"    "Well, you should have seen Katy sitting in the midst of our supper with  her feet rigidly extended before her!" cried the girl, struggling to  regain her composure.
 "Put back that coat and come to your supper.
 It's  time for you to be fed now.
 The last workman has gone and we'll barely  have time to finish nicely and show Katy your dream house before it's  time to go.
"    Peter came and sat in the place Linda indicated.
 His mind was whirling.
  There was something he did not understand, but in her own time, in her  own way, a girl of Linda's poise and self-possession would tell him what  had occurred that could be responsible for the very peculiar things  she had done.
 In some way she had experienced a shock too great for her  usual self-possession.
 The hands with which she fished pickled onions  from the bottle were still unsteady, and the corroboration Peter needed  for his thoughts could be found in the dazed way in which Katy watched  Linda as she hovered over her in serving her.
 But that was not the time.
  By and by the time would come.
 The thing to do was to trust Linda and  await its coming.
 So Peter called on all the reserve wit and wisdom he  had at command.
 He jested, told stories, and to Linda's satisfaction and  Katy's delight, he ate his supper like a hungry man, frankly enjoying  it, and when the meal was finished Peter took Katy over the house,  explaining to her as much detail as was possible at that stage of its  construction, while Linda followed with mute lips and rebellion surging  in her heart.
 When leaving time came, while Katy packed the Bear  Cat, Linda wandered across toward the spring, and Peter, feeling  that possibly she might wish to speak with him, followed her.
 When he  overtook her she looked at him straightly, her eyes showing the hurt her  heart felt.
    "Peter," she said, "that first night you had dinner with us, was Henry  Anderson out of your presence one minute from the time you came into the  house until you left it?"    Peter stopped and studied the ground at his feet intently.
 Finally he  said conclusively: "I would go on oath, Linda, that he was not.
 We were  all together in the living room, all together in the dining room.
 We  left together at night and John was with us.
"    "I see," said Linda.
 "Well, then, when you came back the next morning  after Eileen, before you started on your trip, to hunt a location, was  he with you all the time?"    Again Peter took his time to answer.
    "We came to your house with Gilman," he said.
 "John started to the front  door to tell Miss Eileen that we were ready.
 I followed him.
 Anderson  said he would look at the scenery.
 He must have made a circuit of the  house, because when we came out ready to start, a very few minutes  later, he was coming down the other side of the house.
"    "Ah," said Linda comprehendingly.
    "Linda," said Peter quietly, "it is very obvious that something has  worried you extremely.
 Am I in any way connected with it?"    Linda shook her head.
    "Is there anything I can do?"    The negative was repeated.
 Then she looked at him.
    "No, Peter," she said quietly, "I confess I have had a shock, but it is  in no way connected with you and there is nothing you can do about it  but forget my foolishness.
 But I am glad--Peter, you will never know how  glad I am--that you haven't anything to do with it.
"    Then in the friendliest fashion imaginable she reached him her hand and  led the way back to the Bear Cat, their tightly gripped hands swinging  between them.
 As Peter closed the door he looked down on Linda.
    "Young woman," he said, "since this country has as yet no nerve  specialist to take the place of your distinguished father, if you have  any waves to wave to me tonight, kindly do it before you start or after  you reach the highway.
 If you take your hands off that steering wheel as  you round the boulders and strike that declivity as I have seen you  do heretofore, I won't guarantee that I shall not require a specialist  myself.
"    Linda started to laugh, then she saw Peter's eyes and something in them  stopped her suddenly.
    "I did not realize that I was taking any risk," she said.
 "I won't do it  again.
 I will say good-bye to you right here and now so I needn't look  back.
"    So she shook hands with Peter and drove away.
 Peter slowly followed  down the rough driveway, worn hard by the wheels of delivery trucks, and  stood upon the highest point of the rocky turn, looking after the small  gray car as it slid down the steep declivity.
 And he wondered if there  could have been telepathy in the longing with which he watched it go,  for at the level roadway that followed between the cultivated land  out to the highway Linda stopped the car, stood up in it, and turning,  looked back straight to the spot upon which Peter stood.
 She waved both  hands to him, and then gracefully and beautifully, with outstretched,  fluttering fingers she made him the sign of birds flying home.
 And with  the whimsy in his soul uppermost, Peter reflected, as he turned back for  a microscopic examination of Henry Anderson's coat and the contents of  its pockets, that there was one bird above all others which made  him think of Linda; but he could not at the moment feather Katherine  O'Donovan.
 And then he further reflected as he climbed the hill that  if it had to be done the best he could do would be a bantam hen  contemplating domesticity.
    Linda looked the garage over very carefully when she put away the Bear  Cat.
 When she closed the garage doors she was particular about the  locks.
 As she came through the kitchen she said to Katy, busy with the  lunch box:    "Belovedest, have there been any strange Japs poking around here  lately?"    She nearly collapsed when Katy answered promptly:    "A dale too many of the square-headed haythens.
 I am pestered to death  with them.
 They used to come jist to water the lawn but now they want  to crane the rugs; they want to do the wash.
 They are willing to crane  house.
 They want to get into the garage; they insist on washing the car.
  If they can't wash it they jist want to see if it nades washin'.
"    Linda stood amazed.
    "And how long has this been going on, Katy?" she finally asked.
    "Well, I have had two good months of it," said Katy; "that is, it  started two months ago.
 The past month has been workin' up and the last  ten days it seemed to me they was a Jap on the back steps oftener than  they was a stray cat, and I ain't no truck with ayther of them.
 They  give me jist about the same falin'.
 Between the two I would trust the  cat a dale further with my bird than I would the Jap.
"    "Have you ever unlocked the garage for them, Katy?" asked Linda.
    "No," said Katy.
 "I only go there when I nade something about me work.
"    "Well, Katy," said Linda, "let me tell you this: the next time you go  there for anything take a good look for Japs before you open the door.
  Get what you want and get out as quickly as possible and be sure, Katy,  desperately sure, that you lock the door securely when you leave.
"    Katy set her hands on her hips, flared her elbows, and lifted her chin.
    "What's any of them little haythen been coin' to scare ye, missy?" she  demanded belligerently.
 "Don't you think I'm afraid of them! Comes any  of them around me and I'll take my mopstick over the heads of them.
"    "And you'll break a perfectly good mopstick and not hurt the Jap when  you do it," said Linda.
 "There's an undercurrent of something deep  and subtle going on in this country right now, Katy.
 When Japan sends  college professors to work in our kitchens and relatives of her greatest  statesmen to serve our tables, you can depend on it she is not doing  it for the money that is paid them.
 If California does not wake up very  shortly and very thoroughly she is going to pay an awful price for the  luxury she is experiencing while she pampers herself with the service  of the Japanese, just as the South has pampered herself for generations  with the service of the Negroes.
 When the Negroes learn what there is  to know, then the day of retribution will be at hand.
 And this is not  croaking, Katy.
 It is the truest gospel that was ever preached.
 Keep  your eyes wide open for Japs.
 Keep your doors locked, and if you see one  prowling around the garage and don't know what he is after, go to the  telephone and call the police.
"    Linda climbed the stairs to her workroom, plumped down at the table, set  her chin in her palms, and lost herself in thought.
 For half an hour  she sat immovable, staring at her caricature of Eileen through narrowed  lids.
 Then she opened the typewriter, inserted a sheet and wrote:    MY DEAR Mr. SNOW:    I am writing as the most intimate woman friend of Marian Thorne.
 As  such, I have spent much thought trying to figure out exactly the reason  for the decision in your recent architectural competition; why a man  should think of such a number of very personal, intimate touches that,  from familiarity with them, I know that Miss Thorne had incorporated in  her plans, and why his winning house should be her winning house, merely  reversed.
    Today I have found the answer, which I am forwarding to you, knowing  that you will understand exactly what should be done.
 Enclosed you will  find one of the first rough sketches Marian made of her plans.
 In  some mysterious manner it was lost on a night when your prize-winning  architect had dinner at our house where Miss Thorne was also a guest.
  Before retiring she showed to me and explained the plans with which she  hoped to win your competition.
 In the morning I packed her suitcase and  handed it to the porter of her train.
 When she arrived at San Francisco  she found that the enclosed sheet was missing.
    This afternoon tidying a garage in which Mr. Peter Morrison, the author,  is living while Henry Anderson completes a residence he is building  for him near my home, I reversed a coat belonging to Henry Anderson  to dislodge from its pocket the nest of a field mouse.
 In so doing I  emptied all the pockets, and in gathering up their contents I found this  lost sheet from Marian's plans.
    I think nothing more need be said on my part save that I understood the  winning plan was to become the property of Nicholson and Snow.
 Without  waiting to see whether these plans would win or not, Henry Anderson has  them three fourths of the way materialized in Mr. Morrison's residence  in Lilac Valley which is a northwestern suburb of Los Angeles.
    You probably have heard Marian speak of me, and from her you may obtain  any information you might care to have concerning my responsibility.
    I am mailing the sketch to you rather than to Marian because I feel that  you are the party most deeply interested in a business way, and I hope,  too, that you will be interested in protecting my very dear friend from  the disagreeable parts of this very disagreeable situation.
    Very truly yours,    LINDA STRONG.
        .
 Putting It Up to Peter    When Peter Morrison finally gave up looking in the pockets of Henry  Anderson's coat for enlightenment concerning Linda's conduct, it was  with his mind settled on one point.
 There was nothing in the coat now  that could possibly have startled the girl or annoyed her.
 Whatever had  been there that caused her extremely peculiar conduct she had carried  away with her.
 Peter had settled convictions concerning Linda.
 From the  first instant he had looked into her clear young eyes as she stood in  Multiflores Canyon triumphantly holding aloft the Cotyledon in one  hand and with the other struggling to induce the skirt of her blouse to  resume its proper location beneath the band of her trousers, he had felt  that her heart and her mind were as clear and cool and businesslike  as the energetic mountain stream hurrying past her.
 Above all others,  "straight" was the one adjective he probably would have applied to her.
  Whatever she had taken from Henry's pockets was something that concerned  her.
 If she took anything, she had a right to take it; of that Peter  was unalterably certain.
 He remembered that a few days before she  practically had admitted to him that Anderson had annoyed her, and a  slow anger began to surge up in Peter's carefully regulated heart.
 His  thoughts were extremely busy, but the thing he thought most frequently  and most forcefully was that he would thoroughly enjoy taking Henry  Anderson by the scruff of the neck, leading him to the sheerest part of  his own particular share of the mountain, and exhaustively booting him  down it.
    "It takes these youngsters to rush in and raise the devil where there's  no necessity for anything to happen if just a modicum of common sense  had been used," growled Peter.
    He mulled over the problem for several days, and then he decided he  should see Linda, and with his first look into her straight-forward  eyes, from the tones of her voice and the carriage of her head he would  know whether the annoyance persisted.
 About the customary time for her  to return from school Peter started on foot down the short cut between  his home and the Strong residence.
 He was following a footpath rounding  the base of the mountain, crossing and recrossing the enthusiastic  mountain stream as it speeded toward the valley, when a flash of color  on the farther side of the brook attracted him.
 He stopped, then hastily  sprang across the water, climbed a few yards, and, after skirting a  heavy clump of bushes, looked at Linda sitting beside them--a most  astonishing Linda, appearing small and humble, very much tucked away,  unrestrained tears rolling down her cheeks, a wet handkerchief wadded  in one hand, a packet of letters in her lap.
 A long instant they studied  each other.
    "Am I intruding?" inquired Peter at last.
    Linda shook her head vigorously and gulped down a sob.
    "No, Peter," she sobbed, "I had come this far on my way to you when my  courage gave out.
"    Peter rearranged the immediate landscape and seated himself beside  Linda.
    "Now stop distressing yourself," he said authoritatively.
 "You  youngsters do take life so seriously.
 The only thing that could have  happened to you worth your shedding a tear over can't possibly have  happened; so stop this waste of good material.
 Tears are very precious  things, Linda.
 They ought to be the most unusual things in life.
 Now  tell me something.
 Were you coming to me about that matter that worried  you the other evening?"    Linda shook her head.
    "No," she said, "I have turned that matter over where it belongs.
 I have  nothing further to do with it.
 I'll confess to you I took a paper from  among those that fell from Henry Anderson's pocket.
 It was not his.
 He  had no right to have it.
 He couldn't possibly have come by it honorably  or without knowing what it was.
 I took the liberty to put it where it  belongs, or at least where it seemed to me that it belongs.
 That is all  over.
"    "Then something else has happened?" asked Peter.
 "Something connected  with the package of letters in your lap?"    Linda nodded vigorously.
    "Peter, I have done something perfectly awful," she confessed.
 "I never  in this world meant to do it.
 I wouldn't have done it for anything.
 I  have got myself into the dreadfullest mess, and I don't know how to get  out.
 When I couldn't stand it another minute I started right to you,  Peter, just like I'd have started to my father if I'd had him to go to.
"    "I see," said Peter, deeply interested in the toe of his shoe.
 "You  depended on my age and worldly experience and my unconcealed devotion to  your interests, which is exactly what you should do, my dear.
 Now tell  me.
 Dry your eyes and tell me, and whatever it is I'll fix it all right  and happily for you.
 I'll swear to do it if you want me to.
"    Then Linda raised her eyes to his face.
    "Oh, Peter, you dear!" she cried.
 "Peter, I'll just kneel and kiss your  hands if you can fix this for me.
"    Peter set his jaws and continued his meditations on shoe leather.
    "Make it snappy!" he said tersely.
 "The sooner your troubles are out of  your system the better you'll feel.
 Whose letters are those, and why are  you crying over them?"    "Oh, Peter," quavered Linda, "you know how I love Marian.
 You have seen  her and I have told you over and over.
"    "Yes," said Peter soothingly, "I know.
"    "I have told you how, after years of devotion to Marian, John Gilman let  Eileen make a perfect rag of him and tie him into any kind of knot she  chose.
 Peter, when Marian left here she had lost everything on earth but  a little dab of money.
 She had lost a father who was fine enough to be  my father's best friend.
 She had lost a mother who was fine enough to  rear Marian to what she is.
 She had lost them in a horrible way that  left her room for a million fancies and regrets: 'if I had done this,'  or 'if I had done that,' or 'if I had taken another road.
' And when she  went away she knew definitely she had lost the first and only love of  her heart; and I knew, because she was so sensitive and so fine, I knew,  better than anybody living, how she COULD be hurt; and I thought if I  could fix some scheme that would entertain her and take her mind off  herself and make her feel appreciated only for a little while--I knew in  all reason, Peter, when she got out in the world where men would see her  and see how beautiful and fine she is, there would be somebody who would  want her quickly.
 All the time I have thought that when she came back,  YOU would want her.
 Peter, I fibbed when I said I was setting your  brook for Louise Whiting.
 I was not.
 I don't know Louise Whiting.
 She is  nothing to me.
 I was setting it for you and Marian.
 It was a WHITE head  I saw among the iris marching down your creek bank, not a gold one,  Peter.
"    Peter licked his dry lips and found it impossible to look at Linda.
    "Straight ahead with it," he said gravely.
 "What did you do?"    "Oh, I have done the awfullest thing," wailed Linda, "the most  unforgivable thing!"    She reached across and laid hold of the hand next her, and realizing  that she needed it for strength and support, Peter gave it into her  keeping.
    "Yes?" he questioned.
 "Get on with it, Linda.
 What was it you did?"    "I had a typewriter: I could.
 I began writing her letters, the kind of  letters that I thought would interest her and make her feel loved and  appreciated.
"    "You didn't sign my name to them, did you, Linda?" asked Peter in a dry,  breathless voice.
    "No, Peter," said Linda, "I did not do that, I did worse.
 Oh, I did a  whole lot worse!"    "I don't understand," said Peter hoarsely.
    "I wanted to make them fine.
 I wanted to make them brilliant.
 I wanted  to make them interesting.
 And of course I could not do it by myself.
 I  am nothing but a copycat.
 I just quoted a lot of things I had heard you  say; and I did worse than that, Peter.
 I watched the little whimsy lines  around your mouth and I tried to interpret the perfectly lovely things  they would make you say to a woman if you loved her and were building a  dream house for her.
 And oh, Peter, it's too ghastly; I don't believe I  can tell you.
"    "This is pretty serious business, Linda," said Peter gravely.
 "Having  gone this far you are in honor bound to finish.
 It would not be fair to  leave me with half a truth.
 What is the result of this impersonation?"    "Oh, Peter," sobbed Linda, breaking down again, "you're going to hate  me; I know you're going to hate me and Marian's going to hate me; and I  didn't mean a thing but the kindest thing in all the world.
"    "Don't talk like that, Linda," said Peter.
 "If your friend is all you  say she is, she is bound to understand.
 And as for me, I am not very  likely to misjudge you.
 But be quick about it.
 What did you do, Linda?"    "Why, I just wrote these letters that I am telling you about," said  Linda, "and I said the things that I thought would comfort her and  entertain her and help with her work; and these are the answers that  she wrote me, and I don't think I realized till last night that she  was truly attributing them to any one man, truly believing in them.
 Oh,  Peter, I wasn't asleep a minute all last night, and for the first time I  failed in my lessons today.
"    "And what is the culmination, Linda?" urged Peter.
    "She liked the letters, Peter.
 They meant all I intended them to and  they must have meant something I never could have imagined.
 And in San  Francisco one of the firm where she studies--a very fine man she says he  is, Peter; I can see that in every way he would be quite right for her;  and I had a letter from her last night, and, Peter, he had asked her to  marry him, to have a lifelong chance at work she's crazy about.
 He  had offered her a beautiful home with everything that great wealth and  culture and good taste could afford.
 He had offered her the mothering of  his little daughter; and she refused him, Peter, refused him because she  is in love, with all the love there is left in her disappointed, hurt  heart, with the personality that these letters represent to her; and  that personality is yours, Peter.
 I stole it from you.
 I copied it into  those letters.
 I'm not straight.
 I'm not fair.
 I wasn't honest with her.
  I wasn't honest with you.
 I'll just have to take off front the top of  the highest mountain or sink in the deepest place in the sea, Peter.
  I thought I was straight.
 I thought I was honorable I have made Donald  believe that I was.
 If I have to tell him the truth about this he won't  want to wear my flower any more.
 I shall know all the things that Marian  has suffered, and a thousand times worse, because she was not to blame;  she had nothing with which to reproach herself.
"    Peter put an arm across Linda's shoulders and drew her up to him.
 For a  long, bitter moment he thought deeply, and then he said hoarsely: "Now  calm down, Linda.
 You're making an extremely high mountain out of an  extremely shallow gopher hole.
 You haven't done anything irreparable.
  I see the whole situation.
 You are sure your friend has finally refused  this offer she has had on account of these letters you have written?"    Suddenly Linda relaxed.
 She leaned her warm young body against Peter.
  She laid her tired head on his shoulder.
 She slipped the top letter of  the packet in her lap from under its band, opened it, and held it before  him.
 Peter read it very deliberately, then he nodded in acquiescence.
    "It's all too evident," he said quietly, "that you have taught her that  there is a man in this world more to her liking than John Gilman ever  has been.
 When it came to materializing the man, Linda, what was your  idea? Were you proposing to deliver me?"    "I thought it would be suitable and you would be perfectly happy,"  sobbed Linda, "and that way I could have both of you.
"    "And Donald also?" asked Peter lightly.
    "Donald of course," assented Linda.
    And then she lifted her tear-spilling, wonderful eyes, wide open, to  Peter's, and demanded: "But, oh Peter, I am so miserable I am almost  dead.
 I have said you were a rock, and you are a rock.
 peter, can you  get me out of this?"    "Sure," said Peter grimly.
 "Merely a case of living up to your blue  china, even if it happens to be in the form of hieroglyphics instead of  baked pottery.
 Give me the letters, Linda.
 Give me a few days to study  them.
 Exchange typewriters with me so I can have the same machine.
 Give  me some of the paper on which you have been writing and the address you  have been using, and I'll guarantee to get you out of this in some way  that will leave you Donald, and your friendship with Marian quite as  good as new.
"    At that juncture Peter might have been kissed, but his neck was very  stiff and his head was very high and his eyes were on a far-distant  hilltop from which at that minute he could not seem to gather any  particular help.
    "Would it be your idea," he said, "that by reading these letters I could  gain sufficient knowledge of what has passed to go on with this?"    "Of course you could," said Linda.
    Peter reached in his side pocket and pulled out a clean handkerchief.
  He shook it from its folds and dried her eyes.
 Then he took her by her  shoulders and set her up straight.
    "Now stop this nerve strain and this foolishness," he said tersely.
  "You have done a very wonderful thing for me.
 It is barely possible that  Marian Thorne is not my dream woman, but we can't always have our dreams  in this world, and if I could not have mine, truly and candidly, Linda,  so far as I have lived my life, I would rather have Marian Thorne than  any other woman I have ever met.
"    Linda clapped her hands in delight.
    "Oh, goody goody, Peter!" she cried.
 "How joyous! Can it be possible  that my bungling is coming out right for Marian and right for you?"    "And right for you, Linda?" inquired Peter lightly.
    "Sure, right for me," said Linda eagerly.
 "Of course it's right for me  when it's right for you and Marian.
 And since it's not my secret alone  I don't think it would be quite honorable to tell Donald about it.
 What  hurts Marian's heart or heals it is none of his business.
 He doesn't  even know her.
"    "All right then, Linda," said Peter, rising, "give me the letters and  bring me the machine and the paper.
 Give me the joyous details and tell  me when I am expected to send in my first letter in propria persona?"    "Oh, Peter," cried Linda, beaming on him, "oh, Peter, you are a rock! I  do put my trust in you.
"    "Then God help me," said Peter, "for whatever happens, your trust in me  shall not be betrayed, Linda.
"        .
 Katy Unburdens Her Mind    Possibly because she wished to eliminate herself from the offices of  Nicholson and Snow for a few days, possibly because her finely attuned  nature felt the call, Marian Thorne boarded a train that carried her to  Los Angeles.
 She stepped from it at ten o'clock in the morning, and by  the streetcar route made her way to Lilac Valley.
 When she arrived she  realized that she could not see Linda before, possibly, three in the  afternoon.
 She entered a restaurant, had a small lunch box packed,  and leaving her dressing case, she set off down the valley toward  the mountains.
 She had need of their strength, their quiet and their  healing.
 To the one particular spot where she had found comfort in Lilac  Valley her feet led her.
 By paths of her own, much overgrown for want  of recent usage, she passed through the cultivated fields, left the  roadway, and began to climb.
 When she reached the stream flowing down  the rugged hillside, she stopped to rest for a while, and her mind was  in a tumult.
 In one minute she was seeing the bitterly disappointed face  of a lonely, sensitive man whose first wound had been reopened by the  making of another possibly quite as deep; and at the next her heart was  throbbing because Linda had succeeded in transferring the living Peter  to paper.
    The time had come when Marian felt that she would know the personality  embodied in the letters she had been receiving; and in the past few  days her mind had been fixing tenaciously upon Peter Morrison.
 And the  feeling concerning which she had written Linda had taken possession of  her.
 Wealth did not matter; position did not matter.
 Losing the love of  a good man did not matter But the mind and the heart and the personality  behind the letters she had been receiving did matter.
 She thought long  and seriously When at last she arose she had arrived at the conclusion  that she had done the right thing, no matter whether the wonderful  letters she had received went on and offered her love or not, no matter  about anything.
 She must merely live and do the best she could, until  the writer of those letters chose to disclose himself and say what  purpose he had in mind when he wrote them.
    So Marian followed her own path beside the creek until she neared its  head, which was a big, gushing icy spring at the foot of the mountain  keeping watch over the small plateau that in her heart she had thought  of as hers for years.
 As she neared the location strange sounds began to  reach her, voices of men, clanging of hammers, the rip of saws.
 A look  of deep consternation overspread her face.
 She listened an instant and  then began to run.
 When she broke through the rank foliage flourishing  from the waters of the spring and looked out on the plateau what she saw  was Peter Morrison's house in the process of being floored and shingled.
  For a minute Marian was physically ill.
 Her heart hurt until her hand  crept to her side in an effort to soothe it.
 Before she asked the  question of a man coming to the spring with a pail in his hand, she  knew the answer.
 It was Peter Morrison's house.
 Marian sprang across the  brook, climbed to the temporary roadway, and walked down in front of the  building.
 She stood looking at it intently.
 It was in a rough stage, but  much disguise is needed to prevent a mother from knowing her own child.
  Marian's dark eyes began to widen and to blaze.
 She walked up to the  front of the house and found that rough flooring had been laid so that  she could go over the first floor.
 When she had done this she left the  back door a deeply indignant woman.
    "There is some connection," she told herself tersely, "between my lost  sketch and this house, which is merely a left-to-right rehearsal of  my plans; and it's the same plan with which Henry Anderson won the  Nicholson and Snow prize money and the still more valuable honor of  being the prize winner.
 What I want to know is how such a wrong may be  righted, and what Peter Morrison has to do with it.
"    Stepping from the back door, Marian followed the well-worn pathway  that led to the garage, looking right and left for Peter, and she was  wondering what she would say to him if she met him.
 She was thinking  that perhaps she had better return to San Francisco and talk the matter  over with Mr. Snow before she said anything to anyone else; by this time  she had reached the garage and stood in its wide-open door.
 She looked  in at the cot, left just as someone had arisen from it, at the row of  clothing hanging on a rough wooden rack at the back, at the piled boxes,  at the big table, knocked together from rough lumber, in the center,  scattered and piled with books and magazines; and then her eyes fixed  intently on a packet lying on the table beside a typewriter and a stack  of paper and envelopes.
 She walked over and picked up the packet.
 As she  had known the instant she saw them, they were her letters.
 She stood  an instant holding them in her hand, a dazed expression on her face.
  Mechanically she reached out and laid her hands on the closed typewriter  to steady herself.
 Something about it appealed to her as familiar.
  She looked at it closely, then she lifted the cover and examined the  machine.
 It was the same machine that had stood for years in Doctor  Strong's library, a machine upon which she had typed business letters  for her own father, and sometimes she had copied lectures and book  manuscript on it for Doctor Strong.
 Until his house was completed and  his belongings arrived, Peter undoubtedly had borrowed it.
 Suddenly a  wild desire to escape swept over Marian.
 Her first thought was of her  feelings.
 She was angry, and justly so.
 In her heart she had begun to  feel that the letters she was receiving were from Peter Morrison.
 Here  was the proof.
    Could it be possible that in their one meeting Peter had decided that  she was his dream woman, that in some way he had secured that rough  sketch of her plans, and from them was preparing her dream house for  her? The thought sped through her brain that he was something more  than human to have secured those plans, to have found that secluded and  choice location.
 For an instant she forgot the loss of the competition  in trying to comprehend the wonder of finding her own particular house  fitting her own particular location as naturally as one of its big  boulders.
    She tried to replace the package of letters exactly as she had found  them.
 On tiptoe she slipped back to the door and looked searchingly down  the road, around, and as far as possible through the house.
 Then she  gathered her skirts, stepped from the garage, and began the process  of effacing herself on the mountain side From clump to clump of the  thickest bushes, crouching below the sage and greasewood, pausing to  rest behind lilac and elder, without regard for her traveling suit or  her beautifully shod feet, Marian fled from her location.
 When at last  she felt that she was completely hidden and at least a mile from the  spot, she dropped panting on a boulder, brushing the debris from her  skirts, lifting trembling hands to straighten her hat, and ruefully  contemplating her shoes.
 Then she tried to think in a calm,  dispassionate, and reasonable manner, but she found it a most difficult  process.
 Her mind was not well ordered, neither was it at her  command.
 It whirled and shot off at unexpected tangents and danced as  irresponsibly as a grasshopper from one place to another.
 The flying  leaps it took ranged from San Francisco to Lilac Valley, from her  location upon which Peter Morrison was building her house, to Linda.
  Even John Gilman obtruded himself once more.
 At one minute she was  experiencing a raging indignation against Henry Anderson.
 How had he  secured her plan? At another she was trying to figure dispassionately  what connection Peter Morrison could have had with the building of his  house upon her plan.
 Every time Peter came into the equation her heart  arose in his defense.
 In some way his share in the proceeding was all  right.
 He had cared for her and he had done what he thought would please  her.
 Therefore she must be pleased, although forced to admit to herself  that she would have been infinitely more pleased to have built her own  house in her own way.
    She was hungry to see Linda.
 She wanted Katherine O'Donovan to feed her  and fuss over her and entertain her with her mellow Irish brogue; but if  she went to them and disclosed her presence in the valley, Peter would  know about it, and if he intended the building he was erecting as a  wonderful surprise for her, then she must not spoil his joy.
 Plan in any  way she could, Marian could see no course left to her other than to slip  back to the station and return to San Francisco without meeting any  of her friends.
 She hurriedly ate her lunch, again straightened her  clothing, went to the restaurant for her traveling bag, and took the car  for the station where she waited for a return train to San Francisco She  bought a paper and tried to concentrate upon it in an effort to take her  mind from her own problems so that, when she returned to them, she would  be better able to think clearly, to reason justly, to act wisely.
  She was very glad when her train came and she was started on her way  northward.
 At the first siding upon which it stopped to allow the  passing of a south-bound limited, she was certain that as the cars  flashed by, in one of them she saw Eugene Snow.
 She was so certain that  when she reached the city she immediately called the office and asked  for Mr. Snow only to be told that he had gone away for a day or two  on business.
 After that Marian's thought was confused to the point of  exasperation.
    It would be difficult to explain precisely the state of mind in which  Linda, upon arriving at her home that afternoon, received from Katy the  information that a man named Snow had been waiting an hour for her in  the living room.
 Linda's appearance was that of a person so astonished  that Katy sidled up to her giving strong evidence of being ready to  bristle.
    "Ye know, lambie," she said with elaborate indifference, "ye aren't  havin' to see anybody ye don't want to.
 If it's somebody intrudin'  himself on ye, just say the word and I'll fire him; higher than  Guilderoy's kite I'll be firin' him.
"    "No, I must see him, Katy," said Linda quietly.
 "And have something  specially nice for dinner.
 Very likely I'll take him to see Peter  Morrison's house and possibly I'll ask him and Peter to dinner.
 He is  a San Francisco architect from the firm where Marian takes her lessons,  and it's business about Peter's house.
 I was surprised, that's all.
"    Then Linda turned and laid a hand on each of Katy's hairy red arms.
    "Katherine O'Donovan, old dear," she said, "if we do come back for  dinner, concentrate on Mr. Snow and study him.
 Scrutinize, Katy! It's  a bully word.
 Scrutinize closely.
 To add one more to our long lists of  secrets, here's another.
 He's the man I told you about who has asked  Marian to marry him, and Marian has refused him probably because she  prefers somebody nearer home.
"    Then Linda felt the tensing of every muscle in Katy's body.
 She saw the  lift of her head, the incredulous, resentful look in her eyes.
 There was  frank hostility in her tone.
    "Well, who is there nearer home that Marian knows?" she demanded  belligerently.
    "Well, now, who would there be?" retorted Linda.
    "Ye ain't manin' John Gilman?" asked Katy.
    "No," said Linda, "I am not meaning John Gilman.
 You should know Marian  well enough to know that.
"    "Well, ye ought to know yourself well enough to know that they ain't  anybody else around these diggin's that Marian Thorne's going to get,"  said Katy.
    "I imagine Marian will get pretty much whom she wants," said Linda  laughingly.
 "In your heart, Katy, you know that Marian need not have  lost John Gilman if she had not deliberately let him go.
 If she had been  willing to meet Eileen on her own ground and to play the game with  her, it wouldn't have happened.
 Marian has more brains in a minute than  Eileen has in a month.
"    When Linda drew back the portiere and stepped into the living room  Eugene Snow rose to meet her.
 What either of them expected it might  be difficult to explain.
 Knowing so little of each other, it is very  possible that they had no visualizations.
 What Snow saw was what  everyone saw who looked at Linda--a girl arrestingly unusual.
 With  Linda lay the advantage by far, since she had Marian's letters for a  background.
 What she saw was a tall man, slender, and about him there  was to Linda a strong appeal.
 As she looked into his eyes, she could  feel the double hurt that Fate had dealt him.
 She thought she could  fathom the fineness in his nature that had led him to made home-building  his chosen occupation.
 Instantly she liked him.
 With only one look deep  into his eyes she was on his side.
 She stretched out both her hands and  advanced.
    "Now isn't this the finest thing of you?" she said.
 "I am so glad that  you came.
 I'll tell you word for word what happened here.
"    "That will be fine," he said.
 "Which is your favorite chair?"    "You know," she said, "that is a joke.
 I am so unfamiliar with this room  that I haven't any favorite chair.
 I'll have to take the nearest, like  Thoreau selected his piece of chicken.
"    Then for a few minutes Linda talked frankly.
 She answered Eugene  Snow's every question unhesitatingly and comprehensively.
 Together they  ascended the stairs, and in the guest room she showed him the table  at which she and Marian had studied the sketches of plans, and exactly  where they had left them lying overnight.
    "The one thing I can't be explicit about," said Linda, "is how many  sheets were there in the morning.
 We had stayed awake so late talking,  that we overslept.
 I packed Marian's bag while she dressed.
 I snatched  up what there were without realizing whether there were two sheets or  three, laid them in the flat bottom of the case, and folded her clothing  on top of them.
"    "I see," said Mr. Snow comprehendingly.
 "Now let's experiment a little.
  Of course the window before that table was raised?"    "Yes, it was," said Linda, "but every window in the house is screened.
"    "And what about the door opening into the hall? Can you tell me whether  it was closed or open?"    "It was open," said Linda.
 "We left it slightly ajar to create a draft;  the night was warm.
"    "Is there anyone about the house," inquired Mr. Snow, "who could tell us  certainly whether that window was screened that night?"    "Of course," said Linda.
 "Our housekeeper, Katherine O'Donovan, would  know.
 When we go down we'll ask her.
"    On their return to the living room, for the first time in her life Linda  rang for Katy.
 She hesitated an instant before she did it.
 It would be  establishing a relationship that never before had existed between them.
  She always had gone to Katy as she would have, gone to her mother.
 She  would have gone to her now, but she wanted Katy to make her appearance  and give her information without the possibility of previous discussion.
  Katy answered the bell almost at once.
 Linda went to her side and  reached her arm across her shoulders.
    "Katy," she said, "this is Mr. Eugene Snow of San Francisco He is  interested in finding out exactly what became of that lost plan of  Marian's that we have looked for so carefully.
 Put on your thinking cap,  old dear, and try to answer accurately any question that Mr. Snow may  wish to ask you.
"    Katy looked expectantly at Eugene Snow.
    "In the meantime," said Linda, "I'll be excused and go bring round the  Bear Cat.
"    "I have only one question to ask you," said Mr. Snow.
 "Can you recall  whether, for any reason, there was a screen out of the guest-room window  directly in front of which the reading table was standing the night Miss  Marian occupied the room before leaving for San Francisco?"    "Sure there was," answered Katy instantly in her richest, mellowest  brogue.
    She was taking the inventory she had been told to take.
 She was  deciding, as instantly as Linda had done, that she liked this man.
  Years, appearance, everything about him appealed to Katy as being  exactly right for Marian; and her cunning Irish mind was leaping and  flying and tugging at the leash that thirty years of conventions had  bound upon her.
    "Sure," she repeated, "the wildest santana that ever roared over us just  caught that screen and landed it slam against the side of the garage,  and it set inside for three days till I could get a workman to go up  the outside and put it back.
 It had been out two days before the night  Marian was here.
"    "Did Miss Linda know about it?" asked Snow.
    "Not that I know of," said Katy.
 "She is a schoolgirl, you know, off  early in the morning, back and up to her room, the busiest youngster the  valley knows; and coin' a dale of good she is, too.
 It was Miss Eileen  that heard the screen ripped out and told me it was gone.
 She's the one  who looked after the housekapin' and paid the bills.
 She knew all about  it.
 If 'twould be helpin' Miss Marian any about findin' them plans we've  ransacked the premises for, I couldn't see any reason why Miss Eileen  wouldn't tell ye the same as I'm tellin' ye, and her housekapin'  accounts and her cheque book would show she paid the carpenter, if it's  legal business you're wantin'.
"    "Thank you, Katy," said Mr. Snow.
 "I hope nothing of that kind will  occur.
 A great wrong has been perpetrated, but we must find some way  to right it without involving such extremely nice young women in the  annoyance of legal proceedings.
"    Katy folded her arms and raised her head.
 All her share of the blarney  of Ireland began to roll from the mellow tip of her tongue.
    "Now, the nice man ye are, to be seein' the beauty of them girls so  quick," she said.
 "The good Lord airly in the mornin' of creation  thought them out when He was jist fresh from rist, and the material was  none shopworn.
 They ain't ladies like 'em anywhere else in the whole of  California, and belave me, a many rale ladies have I seen in my time.
  Ye can jist make up your mind that Miss Linda is the broth of the earth.
  She is her father's own child and she is like him as two pase in the  pod.
 And Marian growed beside her, and much of a hand I've had in her  raisin' meself, and well I'm knowin' how fine she is and what a juel  she'd be, set on any man's hearthstone.
 I'm wonderin'," said Katy  challengingly, "if you're the Mr. Snow at whose place she is takin' her  lessons, and if ye are, I'm wonderin' if ye ain't goin' to use the good  judgment to set her, like the juel she would be, in the stone of your  own hearth.
"    Eugene Snow looked at Katy intently.
 He was not accustomed to discussing  his affairs with household helpers, but he could not look at Katy  without there remaining in his vision the forte of Linda standing beside  her, a reassuring arm stretched across her shoulders, the manner in  which she had presented her and then left her that she might be free  to answer as she chose with out her young mistress even knowing exactly  what was asked of her.
 Such faith and trust and love were unusual.
    "I might try to do that very thing," he said, "but, you know, a  wonderful woman is an animated jewel.
 You can't manufacture a setting  and put her in and tighten the clasps without her consent.
"    "Then why don't you get it?" said Katy casually.
    Eugene Snow laughed ruefully.
    "But suppose," he said, "that the particular jewel you're discussing  prefers to select her own setting, and mine does not please her.
"    "Well, they's jist one thing," said Katy.
 Her heels left the floor  involuntarily; she arose on her tiptoes; her shoulders came up, and  her head lifted to a height it never had known before.
 "They's jist one  thing," she said.
 "Aside from Miss Linda, who is my very own child that  I have washed and I have combed and I have done for since she was a  toddlin' four-year-old, they ain't no woman in this world I would go  as far for as I would for Miss Marian; but I'm tellin' ye now, ye Mr.  Eujane Snow, that they's one thing I don't lend no countenance to.
 I am  sorry she has had the cold, cruel luck that she has, but I ain't sorry  enough that I'm goin' to stand for her droppin' herself into the place  where she doesn't belong.
 If the good Lord ain't give her the sense to  see that you're jist the image of the man that would be jist exactly  right for her, somebody had better be tellin' her so.
 Anyway, if Miss  Linda is takin' ye up to the house that Mr. Pater Morrison is buildin'  and the Pater man is there, I would advise ye to cast your most  discernin' eye on that gintleman.
 Ye watch him jist one minute when he  looks at the young missus and he thinks nobody ain't observing him, and  ye'll see what ye'll see.
 If ye want Marian, ye jist go on and take her.
  I'm not carin' whether ye use a club or white vi'lets, but don't ye be  lettin' Marian Thorne get no idea into her head that she is goin' to  take Mr. Pater Morrison, because concernin' Pater I know what I know,  and I ain't goin' to stand by and see things goin' wrong for want of  spakin' up.
 Now if you're a wise man, ye don't nade nothing further said  on the subject.
"    Eugene Snow thought intently for a few moments.
 His vision centered on  Katherine O'Donovan's face.
    "You're absolutely sure of this?" he said at last.
    "Jist as sure as the sun's sure, and the mountains, and the seasons come  and go," said Katy with finality.
 "Watch him and you'll see it stickin'  out all over him.
 I have picked him for me boss, and it's jist adorin'  that man crature I am.
"    "What about Miss Linda?" inquired Snow.
 "Is she adoring him?"    "She ain't nothing but a ganglin' school kid, adorin' the spade with  which she can shoot around that Bear Cat of hers, and race the canyons,  and the rely lovely things she can strike on paper with her pencil and  light up with her joyous colors.
 Her day and her hour ain't come, and  the Pater man's that fine he won't lay a finger on her to wake her up  when she has a year yet of her schoolin' before her.
 But in the manetime  it's my job to stand guard as I'm standin' right now.
 I'm tellin' ye  frank and fair.
 Ye go on and take Marian Thorne because ye ought to have  her.
 If she's got any idea in her head that she's goin' to have Pater  Morrison, she'll have to get it out.
"    Eugene Snow held out his hand and started to the front door in answer to  the growl of the Bear Cat.
 As he came down the steps and advanced to the  car, Linda, with the quick eye that had been one of her special gifts as  a birthright, noted a change in him.
 He seemed to have been keyed up  and toned up.
 There was a different expression on his face.
 There was  buoyancy in his step.
 There was a visible determination in his eye.
 He  took the seat beside her and Linda started the car.
 She looked at him  interrogatively.
    "Can you connect a heavy wind with the date of the lost plan?" he  inquired.
    "There was a crack-a-jack a few days before," said Linda.
 "It blew over  some trees in the lot next to us.
"    "Exactly," said Snow; "and it plucked a screen from your guest-room  window.
 Katy thinks that the cheque to the carpenter and the cost of the  repairs will be in your sister's account books.
"    "Um hm," nodded Linda.
 "Well, that simplifies matters, because Peter  Morrison is going to tell you about a trip Henry Anderson made around  our house the morning Marian left.
"    "I think that is about all we need to know," said Mr. Snow conclusively.
    "I think so," said Linda, "but I want you to see Peter's house for  yourself, since I understand that according to your contract the rights  to reproduce these particular plans remained with you after you had paid  prize money for them.
"    "Most certainly," said Mr. Snow.
 "We should have that much to show for  our share of the transaction.
"    "It's a queer thing," said Linda.
 "You would have to know me a long  time, and perhaps know under what conditions I have been reared in order  to understand a feeling that I frequently have concerning people.
 I  tobogganed down a sheer side of Multiflores Canyon one day without my  path having been previously prepared, and I very nearly landed in the  automobile that carried Henry Anderson and Peter Morrison on their first  trip to Lilac Valley.
 I was much interested in preserving the integrity  of my neck.
 I fervently hoped not to break more than a dozen of my  legs and arms, and was forced to bring down intact the finest Cotyledon  pulverulenta that Daddy or I had found in fourteen years of collecting  in California.
 I am telling you all this that you may see why I  might have been excused for not having been minutely observant of  my surroundings when I landed.
 But what I did observe was a chilly,  caterpillary sensation chasing up my spine the instant I met the eyes of  Henry Anderson.
 In that instant I said to myself that I would not trust  him, that I did not like him.
"    "And what about his companion?" asked Eugene Snow lightly.
 "Oh, Peter?"  said Linda.
 There was a caress in her pronunciation of the name.
 "Why,  Peter is a rock.
 The instant I deposited my Cotyledon in a safe place I  would have put my hand in Peter Morrison's and started around the world  if he had asked me to go.
 There is only one Peter.
 You will recognize  that the instant you meet him.
"    "I am altogether willing to take your word for it," said Mr. Snow.
    "And there is one thing about this disagreeable business," said Linda.
  "It was not Peter's coat that had the plan in it.
 He knew nothing about  it.
 He has had his full service of stiff war work, and he has been  knocking around big cities in newspaper work, and now he has come home  to Lilac Valley to 'set up his rest,' as in the hymn book, you know.
 He  built his garage first and he is living in it because he so loves this  house of his that he has to be present to watch it grow in minute  detail.
 Once on a time I saw a great wizard walking along the sidewalk,  and he looked exactly like any man.
 He might have been you so far as  anything different from other men in his appearance w as concerned.
"    Linda cut down the Bear Cat to its slowest speed.
    "What is on my mind is this," she said.
 "I don't think Peter could quite  afford the amount of ground he has bought, and the house he is building.
  I think possibly he is tying himself up in obligations.
 It may take him  two or three years to come even on it; but it is a prepossession with  him.
 Now can't you see that if we go to him and tell him this sordid,  underhand, unmanly tale, how his fine nature is going to be hurt,  how his big heart is going to be wrung, how his home-house that he is  building with such eager watchfulness will be a weighty Old Man of the  Sea clinging to his back? Do you think, Mr. Eugene Snow, that you're  enough of a wizard to examine this house and to satisfy yourself as to  whether it's an infringement of your plans or not, without letting Peter  know the things about it that would spoil it for him?"    Eugene Snow reached across and closed a hand over the one of Linda's  nearest him on the steering wheel.
    "You very decent kid, you," he said appreciatively.
 "I certainly am  enough of a wizard to save your Peter man any disillusionment concerning  his dream house.
"    "Oh, but he is not my Peter man," said Linda.
 "We are only the best  friends in the world.
 Really and truly, if you can keep a secret, he's  Marian's.
"    "Is he?" asked Mr. Snow interestedly.
 And then he added very casually,  in the most offhand manner--he said it more to an orange orchard through  which they were passing than he said it to Linda--"I have very grave  doubts about that.
 I think there must be some slight complication that  will have to be cleared up.
"    Linda's heart gave a great jump of consternation.
    "Indeed no," she said emphatically.
 "I don't think he has just told  Marian yet, but I am very sure that he cares for her more than for any  other woman, and I am equally sure she cares for him; and nothing could  be more suitable.
"    "All right then," agreed Mr. Snow.
    Linda put the Bear Cat at the mountain, crept around the road, skirted  the boulders, and stopped halfway to the garage.
 And there, in a low  tone, she indicated to Mr. Snow where they had lunched, when she found  the plans, how she had brought out the coat, where she had emptied the  mouse nest.
 Then she stepped from the car and hallooed for Peter.
 Peter  came hurrying from the garage, and Eugene Snow was swift in his mental  inventory.
 It coincided exactly with Linda's.
 He would have been willing  to join hands with Peter and start around the world, quite convinced  of the fairness of the outcome, with no greater acquaintance than one  intent look at Peter, one grip of his sure hand.
 After that he began to  act on Katy's hint, and in a very short time he had convinced himself  that she was right.
 Maybe Peter tried to absorb himself in the plans he  was going over, in the house he was proud to show the great architect;  but it seemed to the man he was entertaining that his glance scarcely  left Linda, that he was so preoccupied with where she went and what she  did that he was like a juggler keeping two mental balls in the air at  the same time.
    It seemed to Peter a natural thing that, the architect being in the city  on business, he should run out to call on Miss Thorne's dearest friend  It seemed to him equally natural that Linda should bring him to see  a house in which she was so kindly interesting herself.
 And just when  Peter was most dexterous in his juggling, just when he was trying to  explain the very wonderful step-saving' time-saving, rational kitchen  arrangements and at the same time watch Linda on her course down to the  spring, the architect halted him with a jerk.
 Eugene Snow stood very  straight, his hands in his coat pockets, looking, Peter supposed, with  interest at the arrangements of kitchen conveniences.
 His next terse  sentence fairly staggered Peter.
 He looked him straight in the eye  and inquired casually: "Chosen your dream woman to fit your house,  Morrison?"    Peter was too surprised to conceal his feelings.
 His jaws snapped  together; a belligerent look sprang into his eyes.
    "I have had a good deal to do with houses," continued Mr. Snow.
 "They  are my life work.
 I find that invariably they are built for a woman.
  Almost always they are built from her plans, and for her pleasure.
 It's  a new house, a unique house, a wonderful house you're evolving here.
 It  must be truly a wonderful woman you're dreaming about while you build  it.
"    That was a nasty little trap.
 With his years and worldly experience  Peter should not have fallen into it; but all men are children when they  are sick, heart sick or body sick, and Peter was a very sick man at that  minute.
 He had been addressed in such a frank and casual manner.
 His own  brain shot off at queer tangents and led him constantly into unexpected  places.
 The narrow side lane that opened up came into view so suddenly  that Peter, with the innocence of a four-year-old, turned with military  precision at the suggestion and looked over the premises for the exact  location of Linda.
 Eugene Snow had seen for himself the thing that Katy  had told him he would see if he looked for it.
 Suddenly he held out his  hand.
    "As man to man, Morrison, in this instance," he said in rather a hoarse,  breathless voice, "don't you think it would be a good idea for you and  me to assert our manhood, to manage our own affairs, to select our  own wives if need be? If we really set ourselves to the job don't you  believe we can work out our lives more to our liking than anyone else  can plan for us? You get the idea, don't you, Morrison?"    Peter was facing the kitchen sink but he did not see it.
 His brain was  whirling.
 He did see Snow's point of view.
 He did realize his position.
  But what Mr. Snow knew of his affairs he could only guess.
 The one  thing Mr. Snow could not know was that Linda frankly admitted her  prepossession for her school chum, Donald Whiting, but in any event  if Peter could not have Linda he would much prefer occupying his dream  house alone.
 So he caught at the straw held out to him with both hands.
    "I get you," he said tersely.
 "It is not quite up to the mark of the  manhood we like to think we possess to let our lives be engineered by  a high school kid.
 Suppose we do just quietly and masterfully assert  ourselves concerning our own affairs.
"    "Suppose we do," said Snow with finality.
    Whereupon they shook hands with a grip that whitened their knuckles.
    Then they went back to Lilac Valley and had their dinner together, and  Linda and Peter escorted Eugene Snow to his train and started him on his  return trip to San Francisco feeling very much better.
 Peter would not  allow Linda to drive him home at night, so he left her after the Bear  Cat had been safely placed in the garage.
 As she stood on the walk  beside him, strongly outlined in the moonlight, Peter studied Linda  whimsically.
 He said it half laughingly, but there was something to  think about in what he said:    "I'm just picturing, Linda, what a nice old lady you will be by the time  that high school kid of yours spends four years in college, one on the  continent, and the Lord knows how many at mastering a profession.
"    Linda looked at him with widened eyes.
      KATY UNBURDENS HER MIND    "Why, what are you talking about, Peter? Are you moonstruck?" she  inquired solicitously.
 "Donald's only a friend, you know.
 I love him  because he is the nicest companion; but there is nothing for you to be  silly about.
"    Then Peter began to realize the truth.
 There wasn't anything for him to  be concerned about.
 She had not the slightest notion what love meant,  even as she announced that she loved Donald.
        .
 Peter's Release    Eugene Snow returned to San Francisco enthusiastic about Linda, while he  would scarcely have known how to express his appreciation of Katherine  O'Donovan.
 He had been served a delicious dinner, deftly and quietly,  such food as men particularly like; but there had been no subservience.
  If Katherine O'Donovan had been waiting on her own table, serving her  own friends she could not have managed with more pride.
 It was very  evident that she loved service, that she loved the girl to whom she gave  constant attention.
 He understood exactly what there was in her heart  and why she felt as she did when he saw Linda and Peter together and  heard their manner of speaking to each other, and made mental note  of the many points of interest which seemed to exist between  them.
 He returned to San Francisco with a good deal of a  "See-the-conquering-hero-comes" mental attitude.
 He went directly to  his office, pausing on the way for a box of candy and a bunch of Parma  violets.
 His first act on reaching the office was to send for Miss  Thorne.
 Marian came almost immediately, a worried look in her eyes.
 She  sat in the big, cushioned chair that was offered her, and smiled faintly  when the box was laid on her lap, topped with the violets.
 She looked at  Eugene Snow with an "I-wish-you-wouldn't" expression on her face; but he  smiled at her reassuringly.
    "Nothing," he said.
 "Picked them up on the way from the station.
 I made  a hasty trip to that precious Lilac Valley of yours, and I must say it  pales your representation.
 It is a wonderfully lovely spot.
"    Marian settled back in the chair.
 She picked up the violets and ran an  experienced finger around the stems until she found the pin with which  she fastened them at her waist.
 Then as they occupied themselves making  selections from the candy box he looked smilingly at Marian.
 Her eyes  noted the change in him.
 He was neither disappointed nor sad.
 Something  had happened in Lilac Valley that had changed his perspective.
  Womanlike, she began probing.
    "Glad you liked my valley," she said.
 "We are told that blue is a  wonderful aura to surround a person, and it's equally wonderful when it  surrounds a whole valley.
 With the blue sky and the blue walls and a few  true-blue friends I have there, it's naturally a very dear spot to me.
"    "Yes," said Mr. Snow, "I can see that it is.
 I ran down on a business  matter.
 I have been deeply puzzled and much perturbed over this prize  contest.
 We have run these affairs once a year, sometimes oftener, for  a long time, so I couldn't understand the peculiar thing about the  similarity of the winning plans and your work this year.
 I have been  holding up the prize money, because I did not feel that you were saying  exactly what was in your heart, and I couldn't be altogether satisfied  that everything was right.
 I went to Lilac Valley because I had a letter  from your friend, Miss Linda Strong.
 There was an enclosure in it.
"    He drew from his pocket the folded sheet and handed it to Marian.
 Her  eyes were surprised, incredulous, as she opened the missing sheet  from her plans, saw the extraneous lines drawn upon it and the minute  figuring with which the margin was covered.
    "Linda found it at last!" she cried.
 "Where in this world did she get  it, and whose work is this on it?"    "She got it," said Eugene Snow, "when she undertook to clean Peter  Morrison's workroom on an evening when she and her cook were having  supper with him.
 She turned a coat belonging to his architect that hung  with some of his clothing in Peter Morrison's garage.
 She was shaking  the nest of a field mouse from one of the side pockets.
 Naturally this  emptied all the pockets, and in gathering up their contents she came  across that plan, which she recognized.
 She thought it was right to take  it and very wisely felt that it was man's business, so she sent it to me  with her explanations.
 I went to Lilac Valley because I wanted to judge  for myself exactly what kind of young person she was.
 I wanted to see  her environment.
 I wanted to see the house that she felt sure was being  built from these plans.
 I wanted to satisfy myself of the stability  of what I had to work on before I mentioned the matter to you or Henry  Anderson.
"    Marian sat holding the plan, listening absorbedly to what he was saying.
    "It's an ugly business," he said, "so ugly that there is no question  whatever but that it can be settled very quietly and without any  annoyance to you.
 I shall have to take the matter up with the board,  but I have the details so worked out that I shall have no difficulty  in arranging matters as I think best.
 There is no question whatever,  Marian, but Anderson found that sketch on the west side of the Strong  residence.
 When you left your plans lying on a table before a window in  the Strong guestroom the night before you came to San Francisco you did  not know that the santana which raged through the valley a day or two  previously had stripped a screen from the window before which you left  them.
 In opening your door to establish a draft before you went to  bed you started one that carried your top drawing through the window.
  Waiting for Miss Strong the next morning, in making a circuit of  the grounds Anderson found it and appropriated it to most excellent  advantage.
 Miss Linda tells me that your study of architecture was  discussed at the dinner table that night.
 He could not have helped  realizing that any sheet of plans he found there must have been yours.
  If he could acquit his conscience of taking them and using them, he  would still have to explain why he was ready to accept the first prize  and the conditions imposed when he already had a house fairly well under  construction from the plans he submitted in the contest.
 The rule is  unbreakable that the plans must be original, must be unused, must be our  sole property, if they take the prize.
"    Marian was leaning forward, her eyes wide with interest, her breast  agitated.
 She nodded in acquiescence.
 Eugene Snow reached across and  helped himself to another piece of candy from the box on her knee.
 He  looked at her speculatively and spoke quietly as if the matter were of  no great importance.
    "Would it be agreeable, Marian, if the prize committee should announce  that there were reasons as to why they were not satisfied, that they  have decided to return all plans and call off the present contest,  opening another in a few months in which interested parties may again  submit their drawings? I will undertake swiftly and comprehensively to  eliminate Henry Anderson from California.
 I would be willing to venture  quite a sum that when I finish with the youngster he will see the  beauty of going straight hereafter and the desirability of a change of  atmosphere.
 He's a youngster.
 I hate to make the matter public, not  only on account of involving you and your friends in such disagreeable  business, but I am sorry for him.
 I would like to deal with him like the  proverbial 'Dutch uncle,' then I would like to send him away to make a  new start with the assurance that I am keeping close watch on him.
 Would  you be satisfied if I handled the matter quietly and in my own way?  Could you wait a few weeks for justice?"    Marian drew a deep breath.
    "Of course," she said, "it would be wonderful if you could do that.
 But  what about Peter Morrison? How much did he know concerning the plans,  and what does he know about this?"    "Nothing," said Mr. Snow.
 "That most unusual young friend of yours made  me see the light very clearly concerning Peter Morrison.
 There is no  necessity for him ever to know that the 'dream house,' as Miss Linda  calls it, that he is building for his dream woman has any disagreeable  history attached to it.
 He so loves the spot that he is living on it to  watch that house in minutest detail.
 Miss Linda was fairly eloquent in  the plea she made on his behalf.
 He strikes me as a very unusual person,  and she appealed to me in the same way.
 There must be some scientific  explanation concerning her that I don't just get, but I can see that  she is most unusual when I watched them together and heard them talk of  their plans for the house and the grounds and discussing illustrations  that she is making for articles that he is writing, I saw how deep and  wholesome was the friendship existing between them.
 I even heard that  wonderful serving woman, whom they so familiarly speak of as 'Katy,'  chiding Peter Morrison for allowing Linda to take her typewriter to  him and do her own work with a pen.
 And because Miss Linda seems so  greathearted and loving with her friends, I was rather glad to hear his  explanation that they were merely changing machines for the time being  for a very particular reason of their own.
"    "Do you mean," asked Marian, "that you think there is anything more than  casual friendship between Linda and Peter Morrison?"    "Not on her part," answered Eugene Snow.
 "Anybody can see that she is  a child deeply engrossed in all sorts of affairs uncommon for a girl of  her age and position.
 Her nice perceptions, her wonderful loyalty to  her friends, her loving thought for them, are manifest in everything she  says or does.
 If she ever makes any mistakes they will be from the head,  not from the heart.
 But for the other end of the equation I could speak  authoritatively.
 Katy pointed out to me the fact that if I would watch  Peter Morrison in Miss Linda's presence, I should see that he adored  her.
 I did watch, and I did see that very thing.
 When I taxed him about  building a dream house for a dream woman, his eyes crossed a plateau,  leaped a brook, and started up the side of a mountain.
 They did not rest  until they had found Linda.
"    Marian sat so still that it seemed as if she were not even breathing.
  In view of what Katy had said, and his few words with Peter Morrison,  Eugene Snow had felt justified in giving Marian a hint as to what was  going on in Lilac Valley.
 Exactly what he had done he had no means of  knowing.
 If he had known and had talked intentionally he could not have  made clearer to Marian the thing which for months had puzzled her.
  She was aware that Eugene Snow was talking, that he was describing the  dinner he had been served, the wonderful wild-flower garden that he had  seen, how skillfully Linda drove the Bear Cat.
 She heard these things  and dimly comprehended them but underneath, her brain was seizing  upon one fact after another.
 They had exchanged typewriters.
 The poor,  foolish little kid had known how her health was wracked, how she was  suffering, how her pride would not let her stoop to Eileen's subterfuges  and wage war with her implements for a man she did not want if her  manner of living her everyday life did not appeal to him.
 Linda had  known how lonely and heart hungry and disappointed she had gone away,  and loyally she had tried to create an interest in life for her; and she  had succeeded entirely too well.
 And then in a panic she must have  gone to Peter Morrison and explained the situation; and Peter must  have agreed to take over the correspondence.
 One by one things that had  puzzled her about the letters and about the whole affair began to grow  clear.
 She even saw how Linda, having friendly association with no man  save Peter, would naturally use him for a model.
 The trouble was that,  with her gift of penetration and insight and her facility with her pen,  she had overdone the matter.
 She had not imitated Peter; she had BEEN  Peter.
 Marian arose suddenly.
    She went home, locked the door, and one after another she read the  letters that had piqued, amused, comforted, and finally intrigued her.
  They were brilliant letters, charming, appealing letters, and yet, with  knowledge concerning them, Marian wondered how she could have failed to  appreciate in the beginning that they were from Linda.
    "It goes to prove," she said at last, "how hungry the human heart is for  love and sympathy.
 And that poor kid, what she must have suffered when  she went to Peter for help! And if, as Mr. Snow thinks, he cares for  her, how he must have suffered before he agreed to help her, as no doubt  he did.
 What I have to do is to find some way out of the situation that  will relieve Linda's anxiety and at least partially save my face.
 I  shall have to take a few days to work it out.
 Luckily I haven't answered  my last letter.
 When I find out what I really want to say then I will be  very careful how I say it.
 I don't just exactly relish having my letters  turned over to Peter Morrison, but possibly I can think of some way--I  must think of some way--to make them feel that I have not been any more  credulous than they.
"    While she thought, both Linda and Peter were doing much thinking on the  same subject.
 Linda's heart was full of gratitude to Peter for helping  her out of her very disagreeable situation.
 Peter had not yet opened the  packet of letters lying on his table He had a sickening distaste for the  whole transaction.
 He had thought that he would wait until he received  the first letter he was to answer.
 If it gave him sufficient foundation  in itself for the answer, he would not be forced to search further.
 He  had smoked many pipes on this decision.
 After the visit of Mr. Snow,  Peter had seen a great light and had decided, from the mood and the  attitude of that gentleman after his interview with Katy, that he very  likely would be equal to any complication that might arise when he  reached San Francisco.
 Mulling over the situation one day Peter said  reflectively to the spring which was very busy talking to him: "I am  morally certain that this matter has resolved itself into a situation  that closely resembles the bootblack's apple: 'they ain't goin' to be  any core.
' I am reasonably certain that I never shall have a letter to  answer.
 In a few days probably I shall be able to turn back that packet  to Linda without having opened it.
"    To make up for the perturbation which had resulted in failure in  class and two weeks of work that represented her worst appearances in  high-school history, Linda, her mind freed from the worry over Marian's  plans, and her heart calmer over the fiasco in trying to comfort her,  devoted herself absorbingly to her lessons and to the next magazine  article that she must finish.
 She had decided that it was time to write  on the subject of Indian confections.
 Her first spare minute she and  Katy must busy themselves working out the most delicious cactus candy  possible.
 Then they could try the mesquite candy.
 No doubt she could  evolve a delicious gum from the mesquite and the incense plant.
 She knew  she could from the willow milkweed; and under the head of "sweets" an  appetizing jelly from manzanita.
 There were delightful drinks too, from  the manzanita and the chia.
 And better than either, the lemonade berry  would serve this purpose.
 She had not experimented to an authoritative  extent with the desert pickles.
 And among drinks she might use the  tea made from blue-eyed grass, brewed by the Indians for feverish  conditions; and there was a whole world of interest to open up in  differing seeds and berries, parched or boiled for food.
 And there were  the seeds that were ground for mush, like the thistle sage, and the mock  orange which was food and soap also, and the wild sunflowers that were  parched for meal, and above all, the acorns.
 She could see that her  problem was not going to be one of difficulty in securing sufficient  material for her book; it would be how to find time to gather all these  things, and put them through the various processes and combinations  necessary to make edible dishes from I them.
 It would mean a long summer  of interesting and absorbing I work for her and for Katy.
 Much of it  could not be done until the I summer was far advanced and the seeds and  the berries were I ripe.
 She could rely on Donald to help her search for  the material.
 With only herself and Katy in the family they could give  much of their time to the work.
    "Where Katy will rebel," said Linda to herself, "is when it comes to  gathering sufficient seeds and parching them to make these meal and mush  dishes.
 She will call it 'fiddlin' business.
' She shall be propitiated  with a new dress and a beautiful bonnet, and she shall go with me  frequently to the fields.
 The old dear loves to ride.
 First thing I do  I'll call at the bank again and have our affairs properly straightened  and settled there in the light of the letter Daddy left me.
 Then I shall  have money to get all the furniture and the rugs and things we truly  need.
 I'll repaint the kitchen and get Katy some new cooking utensils to  gladden her soul.
 And Saturday I must make my trip with Donald account  for something worth while on the book.
"    All these plans were feasible.
 What Linda had to do was to accomplish  them, and this she proceeded to do in a swift and businesslike manner.
  She soon reached the place where the whole house with the exception  of Eileen's suite had been gone over, freshened and refurnished to her  liking.
 The guest-room furniture had been moved to her rejuvenated room.
  On the strength of her I returns from the book she had disposed of her  furniture and was finding much girlish delight in occupying a beautiful  room, daintily decorated, comfortably furnished with pieces of her own  selection.
 As she and Katy stood looking over their work when everything  was ready for her first night of occupancy Katy had said to her:    "It's jist right and proper, lambie; it's jist the way it ought to be;  and now say the word and let me clean out Eileen's suate and get it  ready for Miss Marian, so if she would drop down unexpected she would  find we was good as our word.
"    "All right," said Linda.
    "And what am I to do with the stuff?" inquired Katy.
    "Katy, my dear," said Linda with a dry laugh, "you'll think I am  foolish, but I have the queerest feeling concerning those things.
 I  can't feel that Eileen has done with them; I can't feel that she  will never want them again; I can't feel that they should go to some  second-hand basement.
 Pack all of her clothing that you can manage in  her trunk and put it in the garret, and what the trunk won't hold pack  in a tight box and put that in the garret also.
 She hasn't written me  a line; she has sent me no address; I don't know what to do; but, as I  have said before, I am going to save the things at least a year and see  whether some day Eileen won't think of something she wants to do with  them.
 Clean the rooms and I will order Marian's things sent.
"    According to these arrangements it was only a few days until Linda wrote  Marian that her room was ready for her and that any time she desired to  come and take possession she could test the lovingness of the welcome  that awaited her by becoming intimately acquainted with it.
 Marian  answered the letter immediately.
 She said that she was planning to come  very soon to test that welcome.
 She longed for the quiet of the valley,  for its cool, clean, wild air.
 She was very tired; she needed rest.
 She  thought she would love the new home they were offering her.
 Then came  two amazing paragraphs.
    The other day Dana and I went into one of the big cafes in the city to  treat ourselves to a taste of the entertainment with which the people  of wealth regale themselves.
 We had wandered in laughingly jesting about  what we should order, and ran into Eileen in the company of her aunt and  uncle and a very flashy and loudly dressed young man, evidently a new  suitor of Eileen's.
 I don't think Eileen wanted to introduce us, and yet  she acted like a person ravenous for news of her home and friends.
 She  did introduce us, and immediately her ponderous uncle took possession of  us.
 It seems that the man is a brother of Eileen's mother.
 Linda, he is  big and gross, he is everything that a man of nice perceptions would not  be, but he does love Eileen.
 He is trying conscientiously to please  her.
 His wife is the kind of person who would marry that kind of man and  think everything he said and did was right.
 And the suitor, my dear, was  the kind of man who could endure that kind of people.
 Eileen was almost,  if not quite, the loveliest thing I ever have seen.
 She was plain; she  was simple; but it was the costly simplicity of extravagance.
 Ye gods!  but she had pearls of the size she had always wanted.
 She tried with  all her might to be herself, but she knows me well enough to know what  I would think and what I would write to you concerning the conditions  under which I met her.
 We were simply forced to lunch with them.
 We  could only nibble at the too rich, too highly seasoned food set before  us.
 And I noticed that Eileen nibbled also.
 She is not going to grow fat  and waddle and redden her nose, but, my dear, back deep in her eyes and  in the curve of her lips and in the tone of her voice there were such  disappointment and discontent as I never have seen in any woman.
 She  could not suppress them; she could not conceal them.
 There was nothing  on earth she could do but sit quietly and endure.
 They delivered us at  our respective offices, leaving both of us dates on which to visit them,  but neither of us intends to call on them.
 Eileen's face was a tragedy  when her uncle insisted on making the arrangements.
 I can at least spare  her that.
    And now, my dear, life is growing so full and my time is so taken with  my work at the office and with my widening friendships with Dana and  her friends and with Mr. Snow, that I really feel I have not time to go  farther with our anonymous correspondence.
 It is all I can do to find  time to write you letters such as the one I am writing I have done my  best to play up to what you expected of me and I think I have succeeded  in fooling you quite as much as you have felt that you were fooling me.
  But, Linda dear, I want you always to know that I appreciate the spirit  in which you began this thing.
 I know why you did it and I shall always  love you a trifle more for your thought of me and your effort to tide  over the very dark days you knew I would be facing in San Francisco.
  I think, dear friend of mine, that I have had my share of dark days.
  I think there is very beautiful sunlight ahead for me.
 And by and by I  hope to come into happiness that maybe is even more than my share.
 I am  coming to see you soon and then I will tell you all about it.
    There was more of the letter, but at that point Linda made one headlong  rush for the Bear Cat.
 She took the curve on two wheels and almost ran  into the mountain face behind the garage before she could slow down.
  Then she set the Cat screaming wildly for Peter.
 As he came up to the  car she leaned toward him, shaking with excitement.
    "Peter," she cried, "have you opened that packet of letters yet?"    "No," said Peter, "I have not.
"    "Then give them to me quickly, Peter," said Linda.
    Peter rushed into the garage and brought out the packet.
 Linda caught it  in both hands and dropped it in her lap.
    "Well, thank God," she said devoutly.
 "And, Peter, the joke's on me.
  Marian knew I was writing those letters all the time and she just  pretended that she cared for them to make the game interesting for me.
  And when she had so many friends and so much to do, she hadn't time  for them any longer; then she pretended that she was getting awfully in  earnest in order to stop me, and she did stop me all right.
"    Linda's face was a small panorama of conflicting emotions as she  appealed to Peter.
    "Peter," she said in a quivering voice, "you can testify that she  stopped me properly, can't you, Peter?"    Peter tried to smile.
 He was older than Linda, and he was thinking  swiftly, intently.
    "Yes, kid," he said with utmost corroboration, "yes, kid, she stopped  you, but I can't see that it was necessary literally to scare the life  out of you till she had you at the point where you were thinking of  taking off from a mountain or into the sea.
 Did you really mean that,  Linda?"    Linda relaxed suddenly.
 She sank back into the deeply padded seat of the  Bear Cat.
 A look of fright and entreaty swept into her dark eyes.
    "Yes, Peter, I did mean it," she said with finality.
 "I couldn't have  lived if I had hurt Marian irreparably.
 She has been hurt so much  already.
 And, Peter, it was awfully nice of you to wait about reading  these letters.
 Even if she only did it for a joke, I think Marian would  rather that you had not read them.
 Now I'll go back home and begin to  work in earnest on the head piece of 'How to Grow Good Citizens.
' And I  quite agree with you, Peter, that the oath of allegiance, citizenship,  and the title to a piece of real estate are the prime requisites.
 People  have no business comma to our country to earn money that they intend to  carry away to invest in the development and the strengthening of some  other country that may some day be our worst enemy.
 I have not found out  yet how to say it in a four-by-twelve-inch strip, but by the time I have  read the article aloud to my skylight along about ten tonight I'll get  an inspiration; I am sure I shall.
"    "Of course you will," said Peter; "but don't worry about it, dear; don't  lose sleep.
 Take things slower.
 Give time for a little more flesh to  grow on your bones.
 And don't forget that while you're helping Donald to  keep at the head of his classes it's your first job to keep at the head  of your own.
"    "Thank you," said Linda.
 "How is the dream coming?"    "Beautifully," said Peter.
 "One of these days you're going to come  rushing around the boulders and down the side of the building to find  all this debris cleared away and the place for a lawn leveled.
 I am  fighting down every possible avenue of expertise on the building in the  effort to save money to make the brook run and the road wind where you  have indicated that you want them to follow you.
"    Linda looked at Peter while a queer, reflective light gathered in her  eyes.
 At last she said soberly: "Well, I don't know, Peter, that you  should make them so very personal to me as all that.
"    "Why not?" asked Peter casually.
 "Since there is no one else, why not?"    Linda released the clutch and started the car.
 She backed in front of  the garage and turned.
 She was still thinking deeply as she stopped.
  Once again she extended a hand to Peter.
    "Thank you a thousand times for not reading these letters, Peter," she  said.
 "I can't express how awfully fine I think it is of you.
 And if  it's all right with you, perhaps there's not any real reason why you  should not run that brook and drive that road the way I think they  should go.
 Somebody is going to design them.
 Why shouldn't I, if it  pleases you to have me?"    "It pleases me very greatly," said Peter--"more than anything else I can  think of in all the world at this minute.
"    And then he did a thing that he had done once or twice before.
 He bent  back Linda's fingers and left another kiss in the palm of her hand, and  then he closed her fingers very tightly over it.
        .
 The End of Donald's Contest    The middle of the week Linda had told Katy that she intended stocking  up the Bear Cat for three and that she would take her along on the next  Saturday's trip to her canyon kitchen.
 It was a day upon which she had  planned to gather greens, vegetables, and roots, and prepare a dinner  wholly from the wild.
 She was fairly sure exactly where in nature she  would find the materials she wanted, but she knew that the search would  be long and tiring.
 It would be jolly to have Katy to help her prepare  the lunch.
 It would please Katy immensely to be taken; and the original  things she said in her quaint Irish brogue greatly amused Donald.
 The  arrangement had been understood among them for some time, so they all  started on their journey filled with happy expectations.
 They closed the  house and the garage carefully.
 Linda looked over the equipment of the  Bear Cat minutely making sure that her field axe, saw, knives, and her  field glasses were in place.
 Because more food than usual was to be  prepared in the kitchen they took along a nest of cooking vessels and a  broiler.
 They found Donald waiting before either of them were ready, and  in great glee, with much laughing and many jests they rolled down the  valley in the early morning.
 They drove to the kitchen, spread their  blankets, set up their table, and arranged the small circular opening  for their day's occupancy.
 While Katy and Linda were busy with these  affairs Donald took the axe and collected a big heap of wood.
 Then they  left Katy to burn the wood and have a deep bed of coals ready while they  started out to collect from the canyon walls, the foot of the mountains,  and the near-by desert the materials they would use for their dinner.
    Just where the desert began to climb the mountain Linda had for a  long time watched a big bed of amole.
 Donald used the shovel, she the  hatchet, and soon they had brought to the surface such a quantity that  Donald protested.
    "But I have two uses for them today," explained Linda.
 "They must serve  for potatoes and they have to furnish our meat.
"    "Oh, I get you," said Donald.
 "I have always been crazy to try that.
"    So he began to dig again enthusiastically.
    "Now I'll tell you what I think we had better do," said Linda.
 "We will  skirmish around this side of the mountain and find a very nice tender  yucca shoot; and then we'll take these back to Katy and let her bury  them in the ashes and keep up the fire while we forage for the remainder  of our wild Indian feast.
"    Presently they found a yucca head that Linda said was exactly right, a  delicate pink, thicker than her wrist and two feet in length.
 With this  and the amole they ran back to Katy.
 She knew how to prepare the amole  for roasting.
 Linda gave her a few words of instruction concerning the  yucca.
 Then from the interior of the Bear Cat she drew a tightly rolled  section of wire window screening.
 Just where a deep, wide pool narrowed  at a rocky defile they sank the screening, jammed it well to the bottom,  fastened it tight at the sides, and against the current side of it they  threw leaves, grass, chunks of moss, any debris they could gather that  would make a temporary dam.
 Then, standing on one side with her field  knife, Linda began to slice the remainder of the amole very thin and to  throw it over the surface of the pool.
 On the other, Donald pounded  the big, juicy bulbs to pulp and scattered it broadcast over the water.
  Linda instructed Katy to sit on the bank with a long-handled landing net  and whenever a trout arose, to snatch it out as speedily as possible,  being careful not to take more than they would require.
    Then the two youngsters, exhilarated with youth, with living, with  the joy of friendship, with the lure of the valley, with the heady  intoxication of the salt breeze and the gold of the sunshine, climbed  into the Bear Cat and went rolling through the canyon and out to the  valley on the far side.
 Here they gathered the tenderest heart shoots  of the lupin until Linda said they had enough.
 Then to a particular spot  that she knew on the desert they hurried for the enlarged stems of the  desert trumpet which was to serve that day for an appetizer in the stead  of pickles.
 Here, too, they filled a bucket from the heart of a big  Bisnaga cactus as a basis for their drink.
 Among Katherine O'Donovan's  cooking utensils there was a box of delicious cactus candy made from the  preserved and sun-dried heart meat of this same fruit which was to serve  as their confection.
 On the way back they stopped at the bridge and  gathered cress for their salad.
 When they returned to Katy she had five  fine trout lying in the shade, and with more experienced eyes and a more  skillful hand Linda in a few minutes doubled this number.
 Then they tore  out the dam, rinsed the screen and spread it over a rock to dry.
 While  Donald scaled the fish Linda put the greens to cook, prepared the salad  and set the table.
 Once, as he worked under her supervision, Linda said  to Donald: "Now about bread, kid--there's not going to be any bread,  because the Indians did not have it when they lived the way we are  living today.
 When you reach the place where your left hand feels empty  without a piece of bread in it, just butter up another amole and try  it.
 It will serve the same purpose as bread, and be much better for the  inner man.
"    "If you would let me skin these fish," said Donald, "I could do it much  faster and make a better job of it.
"    "But you shouldn't skin them; you want the skin to hold the meat  together when it begins to cook tender; and you should be able to peel  it off and discard it if it burns or gets smoky in the cooking.
 It's a  great concession to clean them as we do.
 The Indians cooked them in the  altogether and ate the meat from the bones.
"    "Oh my tummy!" said Donald.
 "I always thought there was some dark secret  about the Indians.
"    Linda sat on a rock opposite him and clasped her hands around her knees.
  She looked at him meditatively.
    "Did you?" she asked.
 "Suppose you revise that opinion.
 Our North  American Indians in their original state were as fine as any peoples  that ever have been discovered the round of the globe.
 My grandfather  came into intimate contact with them in the early days, and he said that  their religion, embracing the idea of a great spirit to whom they were  responsible for their deeds here, and a happy hunting ground to which  they went as a reward for decent living, was as fine as any religion  that ever has been practiced by people of any nation.
 Immorality was  unknown among them.
 Family ties were formed and they were binding They  loved their children and reared them carefully.
 They were hardy and  healthful.
 Until the introduction of whiskey and what we are pleased to  term civilized methods of living, very few of them died save from war  or old age.
 They were free; they were happy.
 The moping, lazy, diseased  creature that you find sleeping in the sun around the reservations is a  product of our civilization.
 Nice commentary on civilization, isn't it?"    "For heaven's sake, Linda," said Donald, "don't start any big  brainstorming trains of thought today! Grant me repose.
 I have  overworked my brain for a few months past until I know only one thing  for certain.
"    "All right then, me lad, this is the time for the big secret," said  Linda.
 "I just happened to be in the assembly room on some business  of my own last Thursday afternoon when my sessions were over, and I  overheard your professor in trigonometry tell a marl I did not know, who  seemed to be a friend visiting him, that the son of Judge Whiting was  doing the finest work that ever had been done in any of the Los Angeles  high schools, and that undoubtedly you were going to graduate with  higher honors than any other boy ever had from that school.
"    Donald sat thinking this over.
 He absently lifted an elbow and wiped the  tiny scales from his face with his shirt sleeve.
    "Young woman," he said solemnly, "them things what you're saying, are  they 'cross your heart, honest to goodness, so help you,' truth, or are  they the fruit of a perfervid imagination?"    Linda shook her head vigorously.
    "De but', kid," she said, "de gospel but'.
 You have the Jap going  properly.
 He can't stop you now.
 You have fought your good fight, and  you have practically won it.
 All you have to do is to carry on till the  middle of June, and you're It.
"    "I wish Dad knew," said Donald in a low voice.
    "The Judge does know," said Linda heartily.
 "It wasn't fifteen minutes  after I heard that till I had him on the telephone repeating it as  fast as I could repeat.
 Come to think of it, haven't you noticed a  particularly cocky set of his head and the corksome lightness about his  heels during the past few days?"    "By Jove, he has been happy about something!" said Donald.
 "And I  noticed that Louise and the Mater were sort of cheery and making a  specialty of the only son and brother.
"    "Sure, brother, sure," said Linda.
 "Hurry up and scrape those fish and  let's scamper down the canyon merely for the joy of flying with wings on  our feet.
 You're It, young man, just It!"    Donald was sitting on a boulder.
 On another in front of him he was  operating on the trout.
 His hands were soiled; his hair was tousled;  he was fairly well decorated with fine scales.
 He looked at Linda  appealingly.
    "Am I 'It' with you, Linda?" he asked soberly.
    "Sure you are," said Linda.
 "You're the best friend I have.
"    "Will you write to me when I go to college this fall?"    "Why, you couldn't keep me from it," said Linda.
 "I'll have so many  things to tell you.
 And when your first vacation comes we'll make it a  hummer.
"    "I know Dad won't let me come home for my holidays except for the  midsummer ones," said Donald soberly.
 "It would take most of the time  there would be of the short holidays to travel back and forth.
"    "You will have to go very carefully about getting a start," said Linda,  "and you should be careful to find the right kind of friends at the very  start.
 Christmas and Thanksgiving boxes can always be sent on time to  reach you.
 It won't be so long for you as for us; and by the time you  have Oka Sayye beaten to ravelings you will have such a 'perfect habit'  that you will start right in with the beating idea.
 That should keep you  fairly busy, because most of the men you come up against will be beaters  themselves.
"    "Yes, I know," said Donald.
 "Are you going to start me to college with  the idea that I have to keep up this beating habit? If I were to be one  of fifty or a hundred, wouldn't that be good enough?"    "Why, sure," said Linda, "if you will be satisfied with having me like  fifty or a hundred as well as I do you.
"    "Oh, damn!" said Donald angrily.
 "Do I have to keep up this top-crust  business all my days?"    Linda looked at him with a queer smile on her lips.
    "Not unless you want to, Donald," she said quietly; "not unless you  think you would rather.
"    Donald scraped a fish vigorously.
 Linda sat watching him.
 Presently the  tense lines around his eyes vanished.
 A faint red crept up his neck  and settled on his left cheek bone.
 A confused grin slowly widened his  naturally wide mouth.
    "Then it's me for the top crust," he said conclusively.
    "Then it's me for you," answered Linda in equally as matter-of-fact  tones; and rising, she gathered up the fish and carried them to Katy  while Donald knelt beside the chilly stream and scoured his face and  hands, after which Linda whipped away the scales with an improvised  brush of willow twigs.
    It was such a wonderful day; it was such an unusual and delicious feast.
  Plump brook trout, fresh from icy water, delicately broiled over searing  wood coals, are the finest of food.
 Through the meal to the point where  Donald lay on his back at the far curve of the canyon wall, nibbling a  piece of cactus candy, everything had been perfect.
 Nine months would  be a long time to be gone, but Linda would wait for him, and she would  write to him.
    He raised his head on his elbow and called across to her: "Say, Linda,  how often will you write to me?"    Linda answered promptly: "Every Saturday night.
 Saturday is our day.
  I'll tell you what has happened all the week.
 I'll tell you specially  what a darned unprofitable day Saturday is when you're three thousand  miles away.
"    Bending over the canyon fireplace, her face red with heat and exertion,  Katherine O'Donovan caught up her poker and beat up the fire until the  ashes flew.
    "Easy, Katy, easy," cautioned Linda.
 "We may want to bury those coals  and resurrect them to warm up what is left for supper.
"    "We'll do no such thing," said Katy promptly.
 "What remains goes to feed  the fish.
 Next time it's hungry ye are, we're goin' to hit it straight  to Lilac Valley and fill ourselves with God's own bread and beefsteak  and paraties.
 Don't ye think we're goin' to be atin' these haythen  messes twice in one day.
"    To herself she was saying: "The sooner I get you home to Pater Morrison,  missy, the better I'll be satisfied.
"    Once she stood erect, her hands at her belt, her elbows widespread,  and with narrowed eyes watched the youngsters.
 Her lips were closed so  tightly they wrinkled curiously as she turned back to the fireplace.
    "Nayther one of them fool kids has come to yet," she said to herself,  "and a mighty good thing it is that they haven't.
"    Linda was looking speculatively at Donald as he lay stretched on the  Indian blanket at the base of the cliff.
 And then, because she was for  ever busy with Nature, her eyes strayed above him up the side of the  cliff, noting the vegetation, the scarred rocks, the sheer beauty of the  canyon wall until they reached the top.
 Then, for no reason at all,  she sat looking steadily at a huge boulder overhanging the edge of the  cliff, and she was wondering how many ages it had hung there and how  many more it would hang, poised almost in air, when a tiny pebble at its  base loosened and came rattling and bounding down the canyon face.
 Every  nerve in Linda tensed.
 She opened her mouth, but not a sound came.
 For a  breathless second she was paralyzed.
 Then she shrieked wildly: "Donald,  Donald, roll under the ledge! Quick, quick!"    She turned to Katy.
    "Back, Katy, back!" she screamed.
 "That boulder is loose; it's coming  down!"    For months Donald Whiting had obeyed Linda implicitly and instantly.
 He  had moved with almost invisible speed at her warning many times before.
  Sometimes it had been a venomous snake, sometimes a yucca bayonet,  sometimes poison vines, again unsafe footing--in each case instant  obedience had been the rule.
 He did hot "question why" at her warning;  he instantly did as he was told.
 He, too, had noticed the falling  pebble.
 With all the agility of which he was capable he rolled under  the narrow projecting ledge above him.
 Katherine O'Donovan was a good  soldier also.
 She whirled and ran to the roadway.
 She had barely reached  it when, with a grinding crash, down came the huge boulder, carrying  bushes, smaller rocks, sand, and debris with it.
 On account of its  weight it fell straight, struck heavily, and buried itself in the earth  exactly on the spot upon which Donald had been lying.
 Linda raised  terrified eyes to the top of the wall.
 For one instant a dark object  peered over it and then drew back.
 Without thought for herself Linda  rushed to the boulder, and kneeling, tried to see back of it.
    "Donald!" she cried, "Donald, are you all right?"    "Guess I am, unless it hit one foot pretty hard.
 Feels fast.
"    "Can you get out?" she cried, beginning to tear with her hands at the  stone and the bushes where she thought his head would be.
    "I'm fast; but I'm all right," he panted.
 "Why the devil did that thing  hang there for ages, and then come down on me today?"    "Yes, why did it?" gasped Linda.
 "Donald, I must leave you a minute.
  I've got to know if I saw a head peer over just as that stone came  down.
"    "Be careful what you do!" he cried after her.
    Linda sprang to her feet and rushed to the car.
 She caught out the field  classes and threw the strap over her head as she raced to the far side  of the fireplace where the walls were not so sheer.
 Katherine O'Donovan  promptly seized the axe, caught its carrying strap lying beside it,  thrust the handle through, swung it over her own head, dropped it  between her shoulders, and ripping off her dress skirt she started up  the cliff after Linda.
 Linda was climbing so swiftly and so absorbedly  that she reached the top before she heard a sound behind her.
 Then she  turned with a white face, and her mouth dropped open as she saw Katy  three fourths of the way up the cliff.
 For one second she was again  stiff with terror, then, feeling she could do nothing, she stepped back  out of sight and waited a second until Katy's red head and redder face  appeared over the edge.
 Realizing that her authority was of no avail,  that Katy would follow her no matter where she went or what she did, and  with no time to argue, Linda simply called to her encouragingly: "Follow  where I go; take your time; hang tight, old dear, it's dangerous!"    She started around the side of the mountain, heading almost straight  upward, traveling as swiftly and as noiselessly as possible.
 Over big  boulders, on precarious footing, clinging to bushes, they made their way  until they reached a place that seemed to be sheer above them; certainly  it was for hundreds of feet below On a point of rock screened by  overhanging bushes Linda paused until Katy overtook her.
    "We are about stalled," she panted.
 "Find a good footing and stay where  you are.
 I'm going to climb out on these bushes and see if I can get a  view of the mountain side.
"    Advancing a few yards, Linda braced herself, drew around her glasses,  and began searching the side of the mountain opposite her and below as  far as she could range with the glasses.
 At last she gave up.
    "Must have gone the other way," she said to Katy.
 "I'll crawl back to  you.
 We'll go after help and get Donald out.
 There will be time enough  to examine the cliff afterward; but I am just as sure now as I will be  when it is examined that that stone was purposely loosened to a degree  where a slight push would drop it.
 As Donald says, there's no reason  why it should hang there for centuries and fall on him today.
 Shut your  eyes, old dear, and back up.
 We must go to Donald.
 I rather think it's  on one of his feet from what he said.
 Let me take one more good look.
"    At that minute from high on the mountain above them a shower of sand and  pebbles came rattling down.
 Linda gave Katy one terrified look.
    "My God!" she panted.
 "He's coming down right above us!"    Just how Linda recrossed the bushes and reached Katy she did not know.
  She motioned for her to make her way back as they had come.
 Katy planted  her feet squarely upon the rock.
 Her lower jaw shot out; her eyes were  aflame.
 She stood perfectly still with the exception of motioning Linda  to crowd back under the bushes, and again Linda realized that she had  no authority; as she had done from childhood when Katy was in earnest,  Linda obeyed her.
 She had barely reached the overhanging bushes,  crouched under them, and straightened herself, when a small avalanche  came showering down, and a minute later a pair of feet were level with  her head.
 Then screened by the bushes, she could have reached out and  touched Oka Sayye.
 As his feet found a solid resting place on the ledge  on which Linda and Katy stood, and while he was still clinging to the  bushes, Katherine O'Donovan advanced upon him.
 He had felt that his feet  were firm, let go his hold, and turned, when he faced the infuriated  Irishwoman.
 She had pulled the strap from around her neck, slipped the  axe from it, and with a strong thrust she planted the head of it against  Oka Sayye's chest so hard that she almost fell forward.
 The Jap plunged  backward among the bushes, the roots of which had supported Linda  while she used the glasses.
 Then he fell, sliding among them, snatching  wildly.
 Linda gripped the overhanging growth behind which she had been  screened, and leaned forward.
    "He has a hold; he is coming back up, Katy!" she cried.
    Katy took another step forward.
 She looked over the cliff down an  appalling depth of hundreds of feet.
 Deliberately she raised the axe,  circled it round her head and brought it down upon that particular  branch to which Oka Sayye was clinging.
 She cut it through, and the axe  rang upon the stone wall behind it.
 As she swayed forward Linda reached  out, gripped Katy and pulled her back.
    "Get him?" she asked tersely, as if she were speaking of a rat or a  rattlesnake.
    Katy sank back limply against the wall.
 Linda slowly turned her around,  and as she faced the rock, "Squeeze tight against it shut your eyes, and  keep a stiff upper lip," she cautioned.
 "I'm going to work around you; I  want to be ahead of you.
"    She squeezed past Katy, secured the axe and hung it round her own neck.
  She cautioned Katy to keep her eyes shut and follow where she led her,  then they started on their way back.
 Linda did not attempt to descend  the sheer wall by which they had climbed, but making a detour she went  lower, and in a very short time they were back in the kitchen.
 Linda  rushed to the boulder and knelt again, but she could get no response to  her questions.
 Evidently Donald's foot was caught and he was unconscious  from the pain.
 Squeezing as close as she could, she thrust her arm under  the ledge until she could feel his head.
 Then she went to the other  side, and there she could see that his right foot was pinned under the  rock.
 She looked at Katy reassuringly, then she took off the axe and  handed it to her.
    "He's alive," she said.
 "Can't kill a healthy youngster to have a  crushed foot.
 You stand guard until I take the Bear Cat and bring help.
  It's not far to where I can find people.
"    At full speed Linda put the Cat through the stream and out of the canyon  until she reached cultivated land, where she found a man who would  gather other men and start to the rescue.
 She ran on until she found a  house with a telephone.
 There she called Judge Whiting, telling him to  bring an ambulance and a surgeon, giving him explicit directions as  to where to come, and assuring him that Donald could not possibly be  seriously hurt.
 She found time to urge, also, that before starting he  set in motion any precautions he had taken for Donald's protection.
 She  told him where she thought what remained of Oka Sayye could be found.
  And then, as naturally and as methodically as she had done all the rest,  she called Peter Morrison and told him that she was in trouble and where  he could find her.
    And because Peter had many miles less distance to travel than the others  she had summoned, he arrived first.
 He found Linda and Katy had burrowed  under the stone until they had made an opening into which the broken  foot might sink so that the pain of the pressure would be relieved.
  Before the rock, with picks and shovels, half a dozen sympathetic  farmers from ranches and cultivated land at the mouth of the canyon were  digging furiously to make an opening undermining the boulder so that it  could be easily tipped forward.
 Donald was conscious and they had been  passing water to him and encouraging him with the report that his father  and a good surgeon would be there very soon.
 Katherine O'Donovan had  crouched at one side of the boulder, supporting the hurt foot.
 She was  breathing heavily and her usually red face was a ghastly green.
 Linda  had helped her to resume the skirt of her dress.
 At the other side of  the rock the girl was reaching to where she could touch Donald's head  or reassuringly grip the hand that he could extend to her.
 Peter seized  Linda's axe and began hewing at the earth and rock in order to help in  the speedy removal of the huge boulder.
 Soon Judge Whiting, accompanied  by Doctor Fleming, the city's greatest surgeon, came caring into the  canyon and stopped on the roadway when he saw the party.
 The Judge  sprang from the car, leaped the stream, and started toward them.
 In an  effort to free his son before his arrival, all the men braced themselves  against the face of the cliff and pushed with their combined strength.
  The boulder dropped forward into the trench they had dug for it enough  to allow Peter to crowd his body between it and the cliff and lift  Donald's head and shoulders.
 Linda instantly ran around the boulder,  pushed her way in, and carefully lifting Donald's feet, she managed to  work the lithe slenderness of her body through the opening, so that they  carried Donald out and laid him down in the open.
 He was considerably  dazed and shaken, cruelly hurt, but proved himself a game youngster of  the right mettle.
 He raised himself to a sitting posture, managing a  rather stiff-lipped smile for his father and Linda.
 The surgeon  instantly began cutting to reach the hurt foot, while Peter Morrison  supported the boy's head and shoulders on one side, his father on the  other.
    An exclamation of dismay broke from the surgeon's lips.
 He looked at  Judge Whiting and nodded slightly.
 The men immediately picked up Donald  and carried him to the ambulance.
 Katherine O'Donovan sat down suddenly  and buried her face in the skirt of her dress.
 Linda laid a reassuring  hand on her shoulder.
    "Don't, Katy," she said.
 "Keep up your nerve; you're all right, old  dear.
 Donald's fine.
 That doesn't mean anything except that his foot  is broken, so he won't be able, and it won't be necessary for him,  to endure the pain of setting it in a cast without an anesthetic; and  Doctor Fleming can work much better where he has every convenience.
 It's  all right.
"    The surgeon climbed into the ambulance and they started on an emergency  run to the hospital.
 As the car turned and swept down the canyon, for  no reason that she could have explained, Linda began to shake until her  teeth clicked.
 Peter Morrison sprang back across the brook, and running  to her side, he put his arm around her and with one hand he pressed her  head against his shoulder, covering her face.
    "Steady, Linda," he said quietly, "steady.
 You know that he is all  right.
 It will only be a question of a short confinement.
"    Linda made a brave effort to control herself.
 She leaned against Peter  and held out both her hands.
    "I'm all right," she chattered.
 "Give me a minute.
"    Judge Whiting came to them.
    "I am getting away immediately," he said.
 "I must reach Louise and  Mother before they get word of this.
 Doctor Fleming will take care of  Donald all right.
 What happened, Linda? Can you tell me?"    Linda opened her lips and tried to speak, but she was too breathless,  too full of excitement, to be coherent.
 To her amazement Katherine  O'Donovan scrambled to her feet, lifted her head and faced the Judge.
  She pointed to the fireplace.
    "I was right there, busy with me cookie' utensils," she said, "Miss  Linda was a-sittin, on that exact spot, they jist havin finished atin'  some of her haythen messes; and the lad was lyin, square where the  boulder struck, on the Indian blanket, atin' a pace of cactus candy.
 And  jist one pebble came rattlin' down, but Miss Linda happened to be  lookin', and she scramed to the b'y to be rollin' under where ye found  him; so he gave a flop or two, and it's well that he took his orders  without waitin' to ask the raison for them, for if he had, at the  prisint minute he would be about as thick as a shate of writing paper.
  The thing dropped clear and straight and drove itself into the earth and  stone below it, as ye see.
"    Katherine O'Donovan paused.
    "Yes," said the Judge.
 "Anything else?"    "Miss Linda got to him and she made sure he had brathin' space and he  wasn't hurt bad, and then she told him he had got to stand it, because,  sittin' where she did, she faced the cliff and she thought she had seen  someone.
 She took the telescope and started climbin', and I took the axe  and I started climbin' after her.
"    Katy broke down and emitted a weird Irish howl.
 Linda instantly braced  herself, threw her arms around Katy, and drew her head to her shoulder.
  She looked at Judge Whiting and began to talk.
    "I can show you where she followed me, straight up the face of the  canyon, almost," she said.
 "And she never had tried to climb a canyon  side for a yard, either, but she came up and over after me, like a cat.
  And up there on a small ledge Oka Sayye came down directly above us.
 I  couldn't be mistaken.
 I saw him plainly.
 I know him by sight as well as  I do any of you.
 We heard the stones coming down before him, and we knew  someone was going to be on us who was desperate enough to kill.
 When he  touched our level and turned to follow the ledge we were on, I pushed  him over.
"    Katy shook off Linda's protecting arm and straightened suddenly.
    "Why, ye domned little fool, ye!" she screamed.
 "Ye never told a lie  before in all your days! Judge Whiting, I had the axe round me neck by  the climbin' strap, and I got it in me fingers when we heard the crature  comin', and against his chist I set it, and I gave him a shove that sint  him over.
 Like a cat he was a-clingin' and climbin', and when I saw him  comin' up on us with that awful face of his, I jist swung the axe like I  do when I'm rejoocin' a pace of eucalyptus to fireplace size, and whack!  I took the branch supportin' him, and a dome' good axe I spoiled din'  it.
"    Katy folded her arms, lifted her chin higher than it ever had been  before, and glared defiance at the Judge.
    "Now go on," she said, "and decide what ye'll do to me for it.
"    The Judge reached over and took both Katherine O'Donovan's hands in a  firm grip.
    "You brave woman!" he said.
 "If it lay in my power, I would give you the  Carnegie Medal.
 In any event I will see that you have a good bungalow  with plenty of shamrock on each side of your front path, and a fair  income to keep you comfortable when the rheumatic days are upon you.
"    "I am no over-feeder," said Katy proudly.
 "I'm daily exercisin' me  muscles enough to kape them young.
 The rheumatism I'll not have.
 And  nayther will I have the house nor the income.
 I've saved me money; I've  an income of me own.
"    "And as for the bungalow," interrupted Linda, "Katherine, as I have  mentioned frequently before is my father, and my mother, and my whole  family, and her front door is mine.
"    "Sure," said Katy proudly.
 "When these two fine people before you set  up their hearthstone, a-swapin' it I'll be, and carin' for their  youngsters; but, Judge, I would like a bit of the shamrock.
 Ye might be  sendin' me a start of that, if it would plase Your Honor.
"    Judge Whiting looked intently at Katherine O'Donovan.
 And then, as if  they had been on the witness stand, he looked searchingly at Linda.
 But  Linda was too perturbed, too accustomed to Katy's extravagant nonsense  even to notice the purport of what she had said.
 Then the Judge turned  his attention to Peter Morrison and realized that at least one of the  parties to Katherine's proposed hearthstone had understood and heartily  endorsed her proposal.
    "I will have to be going.
 The boy and his mother will need me," he said.
  "I will see all of you later.
"    Then he sprang across the brook and sent his car roaring down the canyon  after the ambulance.
    Once more Katy sank to the ground.
 Linda looked at her as she buried her  face and began to wail.
    "Peter," she said quietly, "hunt our belongings and pack them in the  Bear Cat the best you can.
 Excuse us for a few minutes.
 We must act this  out of our systems.
"    Gravely she sat down beside Katy, laid her head on her shoulder, and  began to cry very nearly as energetically as Katy herself.
 And that was  the one thing which was most effective in restoring Katy's nerves.
 Tears  were such an unaccustomed thing with Linda that Katy controlled herself  speedily so that she might be better able to serve the girl.
 In a few  minutes Katy had reduced her emotions to a dry sniffle.
 She lifted her  head, groped for her pocket, and being unable to find it for the very  good reason that she was sitting upon it, she used her gingham hem as  a handkerchief.
 Once she had risen to the physical effort of wiping her  eyes, she regained calmness rapidly.
 The last time she applied the  hem she looked at Peter, but addressed the Almighty in resigned tones:  "There, Lord, I guess that will do.
"    In a few minutes she was searching the kitchen, making sure that no  knives, spoons, or cooking utensils were lost.
 Missing her support,  Linda sat erect and endeavored to follow Katy's example.
 Her eyes  met Peter's and when she saw that his shoulders were shaking, a dry,  hysterical laugh possessed her.
    "Yes, Katy," she panted, "that WILL do, and remember the tears we are  shedding are over Donald's broken foot, and because this may interfere  with his work, though I don't think it will for long.
"    "When I cry," said Katy tersely, "I cry because I feel like it.
 I wasn't  wapin' over the snake that'd plan a death like that for anyone"--Katy  waved toward the boulder--"and nayther was I wastin' me tears over the  fut of a kid bein' jommed up a trifle.
"    "Well, then, Katy," asked Linda tremulously, "why were you crying?"    "Well, there's times," said Katy judicially, "when me spirits tell me I  would be the better for lettin' off a wee bit of stame, and one of them  times havin' arrived, I jist bowed me head to it, as is in accordance  with the makings of me.
 Far be it from me to be flyin' in the face of  Providence and sayin' I won't, when all me interior disposhion says to  me: 'Ye will!'"    "And now, Linda," said Peter, "can you tell us why you were crying?"    "Why, I think," said Linda, "that Katy has explained sufficiently for  both of us.
 It was merely time for us to howl after such fearful nerve  strain, so we howled.
"    "Well, that's all right," said Peter.
 "Now I'll tell you something.
 If  you had gone away in that ambulance to an anesthetic and an operation,  no wildcat that ever indulged in a hunger hunt through this canyon could  have put up a howl equal to the one that I would have sent up.
"    "Peter," said Linda, "there is nothing funny about this; it's no tame  for jest.
 But do men have nerves? Would you really?"    "Of course I would," said Peter.
    "No, you wouldn't," contradicted Linda.
 "You just say that because you  want to comfort us for having broken down, instead of trying to tease us  as most men would.
"    "He would, too!" said Katy, starting to the Bear Cat with a load of  utensils.
 "Now come on; let's go home and be gettin' craned up and ready  for what's goin' to happen to us.
 Will they be jailin' us, belike, Miss  Linda?"    Linda looked at Peter questioningly.
    "No," he said quietly.
 "It is very probable that the matter never will  be mentioned to you again, unless Judge Whiting gets hold of some clue  that he wishes to use as an argument against matured Japs being admitted  in the same high-school classes with our clean, decent, young Americans.
  They stopped that in the grades several years ago, I am told.
"    Before they could start back to Lilac Valley a car stopped in the canyon  and a couple of men introducing themselves as having come from Judge  Whiting interviewed Katy and Linda exhaustively.
 Then Linda pointed out  to them an easier but much longer route by which they might reach the  top of the canyon to examine the spot from which the boulder had fallen.
  She showed them where she and Katy had ascended, and told them where  they would be likely to find Oka Sayye.
    When it came to a question of really starting, Linda looked with  appealing eyes at Peter.
    "Peter," she said, "could we fix it any way so you could drive Katy and  me home? For the first time since I have begun driving this spring I  don't feel equal to keeping the road.
"    "Of course," said Peter.
 "I'll take your car to the nearest farmhouse  and leave it, then I'll take you and Katy in my car.
"    Late that evening Judge Whiting came to Lilac Valley with his wife and  daughter to tell Linda that the top of the cliff gave every evidence  of the stone having been loosened previously, so that a slight  impetus would send it crashing down at the time when Donald lay in his  accustomed place directly in the line of its fall.
 His detectives had  found the location of the encounter and they had gone to the bottom of  the cliff, a thousand feet below, but they had not been able to find any  trace of Oka Sayye.
 Somewhere in waiting there had been confederates who  had removed what remained of him.
 On the way home Mrs. Whiting said to  her husband: "Judge, are you very sure that what the cook said to you  this afternoon about Miss Strong and Mr. Morrison is true?"    "I am only sure of its truth so far as he is concerned," replied the  Judge.
 "What he thought about Linda was evident.
 I am very sorry.
 She is  a mighty fine girl and I think Donald is very much interested in her.
"    "Yes, I think so, too," said Donald's mother.
 "Interested; but he has  not even a case of first love.
 He is interested for the same reason you  would be or I would be, because she is intellectually so stimulating.
  And you have to take into consideration the fact that in two or three  years more she will be ready for marriage and a home of her own, and  Donald will still be in school with his worldly experience and his  business education not yet begun.
 The best thing that can happen to  Donald is just to let his infatuation for her die a natural death, with  the quiet assistance of his family.
"    The Judge's face reddened slightly.
    "Well, I would like mighty well to have her in the family," he said.
  "She's a corking fine girl.
 She would make a fine mother of fine men.
 I  haven't a doubt but that with the power of his personality and the power  of his pen and the lure of propinquity, Peter Morrison will win her, but  I hate it.
 It's the best chance the boy ever will have.
"     And then Louise spoke up softly.
    "Donald hasn't any chance, Dad," she said quietly, "and he never did  have.
 I have met Peter Morrison myself and I would be only too glad if  I thought he was devoted to me.
 I'll grant that Linda Strong is a fine  girl, but when she wakes up to the worth of Peter Morrison and to a  realization of what other women would be glad to be to him, she will  merely reach out and lay possessive hands upon what already belongs to  her.
"    It was a curious thing that such occurrences as the death of Oka Sayye  and the injury to Donald could take place and no one know about them.
  Yet the papers were silent on the subject and so were the courts.
 Linda  and Katy were fully protected.
 The confederates of Oka Sayye for reasons  of their own preferred to keep very quiet.
    By Monday Donald, with his foot in a plaster cast, was on a side veranda  of his home with a table beside him strewn with books and papers.
 An  agreement had been made that his professors should call and hear his  recitations for a few days until by the aid of a crutch and a cane he  could resume his place in school.
 Linda went to visit him exactly as she  would have gone to see Marian in like circumstances.
 She succeeded in  making all of the Whiting family her very devoted friends.
    One evening, after he had been hobbling about for over a week, Linda and  Peter called to spend the evening, and a very gay and enjoyable evening  it was.
 And yet when it was over and they had gone away together Donald  appeared worried and deeply thoughtful.
 When his mother came to his room  to see if the foot was unduly painful or there was anything she could do  to make him more comfortable, he looked at her belligerently.
    "Mother," he said, "I don't like Peter Morrison being so much with my  girl.
"    Mrs. Whiting stood very still.
 She thought very fast.
 Should she  postpone it or should she let the boy take all of his hurts together?  Her heart ached for him and yet she felt that she knew what life had in  store for him concerning Linda.
 So she sat on the edge of the bed and  began to talk quietly, plainly, reasonably.
 She tried to explain nature  and human nature and what she thought the laws of probability were in  the case.
 Donald lay silent.
 He said nothing until she had finished all  she had to say, and then he announced triumphantly: "You're all wrong.
  That is what would happen if Linda were a girl like any of the other  girls in her class, or like Louise.
 But she has promised that she would  write to me every Saturday night and she has said that she thinks more  of me than of any of the other boys.
"    "Donald dear," said Mrs. Whiting, "you're not 'in love' with Linda  yourself, and neither is she with you.
 By the time you are ready to  marry and settle down in life, Linda in all probability will be married  and be the mother of two or three babies.
"    "Yes, like fun she will," said Donald roughly.
    "Have you asked her whether she loves you?" inquired Mrs. Whiting.
    "Oh, that 'love' business," said Donald, "it makes me tired! Linda and  I never did any mushing around.
 We had things of some importance to talk  about and to do.
"    A bit of pain in Mrs. Whiting's heart eased.
 It was difficult to keep  her lips quiet and even.
    "You haven't asked her to marry you, then?" she said soberly.
 "Oh good  Lord," cried Donald, "'marry!' How could I marry anyone when I haven't  even graduated from high school and with college and all that to come?"    "That is what I have been trying to tell you," said his mother evenly.
  "I don't believe you have been thinking about marriage and I am  absolutely certain that Linda has not, but she is going to be made to  think about it long before you will be in such financial position that  you dare.
 That is the reason I am suggesting that you think about these  things seriously and question yourself as to whether you would be doing  the fair thing by Linda if you tried to tie her up in an arrangement  that would ask her to wait six or eight years yet before you would be  ready.
"    "Well, I can get around faster than that," said Donald belligerently.
    "Of course you can," agreed his mother.
 "I made that estimate fully a  year too long.
 But even in seven years Linda could do an awful lot of  waiting; and there are some very wonderful girls that will be coming up  six or seven years from now here at home.
 You know that hereafter all  the girls in the world are going to be very much more Linda's kind of  girls than they have been heretofore.
 The girls who have lived through  the war and who have been intimate with its sorrow and its suffering  and its terrible results to humanity, are not going to be such heedless,  thoughtless, not nearly such selfish, girls as the world has known in  the decade just past.
 And there is going to be more outdoor life,  more nature study.
 There are going to be stronger bodies, better food,  better-cared-for young people; and every year educational advantages are  going to be greater.
 If you can bring yourself to think about giving up  the idea of there ever existing any extremely personal thing between you  and Linda, I am very sure I could guarantee to introduce you to a girl  who would be quite her counterpart, and undoubtedly we could meet one  who would be handsomer.
"    Donald punched his pillow viciously.
    "That's nice talk," he said, "and it may be true talk.
 But in the first  place I wish that Peter Morrison would let my girl alone, and in the  second place I don't care if there are a thousand just as nice girls  or even better-looking girls than Linda, though any girl would be going  some if she were nicer and better looking than Linda.
 But I am telling  you that when my foot gets better I am going to Lilac Valley and tell  him where to head in, and I'll punch his head if he doesn't do it  promptly.
"    "Of course you will," said his mother reassuringly; "and I'll go with  you and we'll see to it that he attends strictly to his own affairs.
"    Donald burst out laughing, exactly as his mother in her heart had hoped  that he would.
    "Yes, I've got a hand-painted picture of myself starting to Lilac Valley  to fight a man who is butting in with my girl, and taking my mother  along to help me beat him up," he said.
    Mrs. Whiting put her arms around her boy, kissed him tenderly, and  smoothed his hair, and then turned out the lights and slipped from the  room.
 But in the clear moonlight as she closed the door she could see  that a boyish grin was twisting his lips, and she went down to tell the  Judge that he need not worry.
 If his boy were irreparably hurt anywhere,  it was in his foot.
        .
 How the Wasp Built Her Nest    The following weeks were very happy for Linda.
 When the cast was removed  from Donald's foot and it was found that a year or two of care would  put him even on the athletic fields and the dancing floor again, she was  greatly relieved.
    She lacked words in which to express her joy that Marian was rapidly  coming into happiness.
 She was so very busy with her school work, with  doing all she could to help Donald with his, with her "Jane Meredith"  articles, with hunting and working out material for her book, that she  never had many minutes at a time for introspection.
 When she did have  a few she sometimes pondered deeply as to whether Marian had been  altogether sincere in the last letter she had written her in their  correspondence, but she was so delighted in the outcome that if she did  at times have the same doubt in a fleeting form that had not been in  the least fleeting with Peter Morrison, she dismissed it as rapidly as  possible.
 When things were so very good as they were at that time, why  try to improve them?    One evening as she came from school, thinking that she would take Katy  for a short run in the Bear Cat before dinner, she noticed a red head  prominent in the front yard as she neared home.
 When she turned in at  the front walk and crossed the lawn she would have been willing to wager  quite a sum that Katy had been crying.
    "Why, old dear," said Linda, putting her arms around her, "if anything  has gone wrong with you I will certainly take to the warpath, instanter.
  I can't even imagine what could be troubling you.
" Linda lowered her  voice.
 "Nothing has come up about Oka Sayye?"    Katy shook her head.
    "I thought not," said Linda.
 "Judge Whiting promised me that what use he  made of that should be man's business and exploited wholly for the  sake of California and her people.
 He said we shouldn't be involved.
 I  haven't been worried about it even, although I am willing to go upon  the stand and tell the whole story if it will be any help toward putting  right what is at present a great wrong to California.
"    "Yes, so would I," said Katy.
 "I'm not worryin' meself about the little  baste any more than I would if it had been a mad dog foaming up that  cliff at ye.
"    "Then what is it?" asked Linda.
 "Tell me this minute.
"    "I dunno what in the world you're going to think," said Katy "I dunno  what in the world you're going to do.
"    Her face was so distressed that Linda's nimble brain flew to a  conclusion.
 She tightened her arm across Katy's shoulder.
    "By Jove, Katy!" she said breathlessly.
 "Is Eileen in the house?"    Katy nodded.
    "Has she been to see John and made things right with him?"    Katy nodded again.
    "He's in there with her waitin' for ye," she said.
    It was a stunned Linda who slowly dropped her arm, stood erect, and  lifted her head very high.
 She thought intently.
    "You don't mean to tell me," she said, "that you have been CRYING over  her?"    Katy held out both hands.
    "Linda," she said, "she always was such a pretty thing, and her ma  didn't raise her to have the sense of a peewee.
 If your pa had been let  take her outdoors and grow her in the sun and the air, she would have  been bigger and broader, an' there would have been the truth of God's  sunshine an' the glory of His rain about her.
 Ye know, Linda, that she  didn't ever have a common decent chance.
 It was curls that couldn't be  shook out and a nose that dassen't be sunburned and shoes that mustn't  be scuffed and a dress that shouldn't be mussed, from the day she was  born.
 Ye couldn't jist honest say she had ever had a FAIR chance, now  could ye?"    "No," said Linda conclusively, "no, Katherine O'Donovan, you could not.
  But what are we up against? Does she want to come back? Does she want to  stay here again?"    "I think she would like to," said Katy.
 "You go in and see her for  yourself, lambie, before ye come to any decision.
"    "You don't mean," said Linda in a marveling tone, "that she has been  homesick, that she has come back to us because she would like to be with  us again?"    "You go and see her for yourself; and if you don't say she is the  worst beat out and the tiredest mortal that ye have ever seen you'll be  surprisin' me.
 My God, Linda, they ain't nothin' in bein' rich if it can  do to a girl what has been done to Eileen!"    "Oh, well," said Linda impatiently, "don't condemn all money because  Eileen has not found happiness with it.
 The trouble has been that  Eileen's only chance to be rich came to her through the wrong kind of  people.
"    "Well, will ye jist tell me, then," said Katy, "how it happened that  Eileen's ma was a sister to that great beef of a man, which same is hard  on self-rayspectin' beef; pork would come nearer.
"    "Yes," said Linda, "I'll tell you.
 Eileen's mother had a big streak of  the same coarseness and the same vulgarity in HER nature, or she could  not have reared Eileen as she did.
 She probably had been sent to school  and had better advantages than the boy through a designing mother of  her own.
 Her first husband must have been a man who greatly refined and  educated her.
 We can't ever get away from the fact that Daddy believed  in her and loved her.
"    "Yes," said Katy, "but he was a fooled man.
 She wasn't what we thought  she was.
 Many's the time I've stood injustice about the accounts and  household management because I wouldn't be wakin' him up to what he was  bound to for life.
"    "That doesn't help us," said Linda.
 "I must go in and face them.
"    She handed her books to Katy, and went into the living room She  concentrated on John Gilman first, and a wee qualm of disgust crept  through her soul when she saw that after weeks of suffering he was once  more ready to devote himself to Eileen.
 Linda marveled at the power a  woman could hold over a man that would force him to compromise with his  intellect, his education and environment.
 Then she turned her attention  to Eileen, and the shock she received was informing.
 She studied her an  instant incredulously, then she went to her and held out her hand.
    "How do you do?" she said as cordially as was possible to her.
 "This is  unexpected.
"    Her mind was working rapidly, yet she could not recall ever having seen  a woman quite so beautiful as Eileen.
 She was very certain that the  color on her cheeks was ebbing and rising with excitement; it was no  longer so deep as to be stationary.
 She was very certain that her eyes  had not been darkened as to lids or waxed as to lashes.
 Her hair was  beautifully dressed in sweeping waves with scarcely any artificial work  upon it.
 Her dress was extremely tasteful and very expensive.
 There  was no simper on her lips, nothing superficial.
 She was only a tired,  homesick girl.
 As Linda looked at her she understood why Katy had cried  over her.
 She felt tears beginning to rise in her own heart.
 She put  both arms protectingly around Eileen.
    "Why, you poor little thing," she said wonderingly, "was it so damn' bad  as all that?"    Eileen stood straight.
 She held herself rigidly.
 She merely nodded.
 Then  after a second she said: "Worse than anything you could imagine, Linda.
  Being rich with people who have grown rich by accident is a dreadful  experience.
"    "So I have always imagined," said Linda.
 And then in her usual downright  way she asked: "Why did you come, Eileen? Is there anything you wanted  of me?"    Eileen hesitated.
 It was not in Linda's heart to be mean.
    "Homesick, little sister?" she asked lightly "Do you want to come here  while you're getting ready to make a home for John? Is that it?"    Then Eileen swayed forward suddenly, buried her face in Linda's breast,  and for the first time in her life Linda saw and heard her cry, not from  selfishness, not from anger, not from greed, but as an ordinary human  being cries when the heart is so full that nature relieves itself with  tears.
 Linda closed her arms around her and smiled over her head at John  Gilman.
    "Finish all of it before you stop," she advised.
 "It's all right.
 You  come straight home.
 You didn't leave me any word, and I didn't know what  to do with your things, but I couldn't feel that you would want to give  up such beautiful things that you had so enjoyed.
 We had planned for  Marian to spend her summer vacation here so I put her things in your  suite and I had moved mine into the guest room, but I have had my room  done over and the guest room things are in there, and every scrap of  yours is carefully put away.
 If that will do, you are perfectly welcome  to it.
"    Eileen wiped her eyes.
    "Anything," she sobbed.
 "I'd rather have Katy's room than be shamed and  humiliated and hurt any further.
 Linda, I would almost like you to  know my Aunt Callie, because you will never understand about her if you  don't.
 Her favorite pastime was to tell everyone we met how much the  things I wore cost her.
"    Linda released Eileen with a slight shake.
    "Cheer up!" she said.
 "We'll all have a gorgeous time together.
 I  haven't the slightest ambition to know more than that about your Aunt  Callie.
 If my brain really had been acting properly I would never have  dismantled your room.
 I would have known that you could not endure her,  and that you would come home just as you should.
 It's all right, John,  make yourself comfortable.
 I don't know what Katy has for dinner but she  can always find enough for an extra couple.
 Come Eileen, I'll help you  to settle.
 Where is your luggage?"    "I brought back, Linda, just what I have on," said Eileen.
 "I will begin  again where I left off.
 I realize that I am not entitled to anything  further from the Strong estate, but Uncle was so unhappy and John says  it's all right--really I am the only blood heir to all they have; I  might as well take a comfortable allowance from it.
 I am to go to see  them a few days of every month.
 I can endure that when I know I have  John and you to come back to.
"    When Eileen had been installed in Linda's old room Linda went down to  the kitchen, shut the door behind her, and leaning against it, laid her  hand over her mouth to suppress a low laugh.
    "Katy," she said, "I've been and gone and done it; I have put the  perfect lady in my old room.
 That will be a test of her sincerity--even  dainty and pretty as it is since it's been done over.
 If she is sincere  enough to spend the summer getting ready to marry John Gilman--why that  is all right, old girl.
 We can stand it, can't we?"    "Yes," said Katy, "it's one of them infernal nuisances but we can  stand it.
 I'm thinkin', from the looks of John Gilman and his manner of  spakin', that it ain't goin' to be but a very short time that he'll be  waitin'.
"    "Katy," said Linda, "isn't this the most entertaining world? Doesn't it  produce the most lightning-like changes, and don't the most unexpected  things happen? Sort of dazes me.
 I had planned to take a little run with  you and the Cat.
 Since we are having--no, I mustn't say guests--since  John and Eileen have come home, I'll have to give up that plan until  after dinner, and then we'll go and take counsel with our souls and see  if we can figure out how we are going to solve this equation; and if you  don t know what an equation is, old dear heart, it's me with a war-club  and you with a shillalah and Eileen between us, and be 'damned' to us if  we can't make an average, ordinary, decent human being out of her.
 Pin  an apron on her in the morning, Katy, and hand her a dust cloth and tell  her to industrialize.
 We will help her with her trousseau, but she SHALL  help us with the work.
"    "Ye know, lambie," whispered Katy suddenly, "this is a burnin' shame.
  The one thing I DIDN'T think about is that book of yours.
 What about  it?"    "I scarcely know," said Linda; "it's difficult to say.
 Of course we  can't carry out the plans we had made to work here, exactly as we had  intended, with Eileen in the house preparing to be married.
 But she  tells me that her uncle has made her a generous allowance, so probably  it's environment and love she is needing much more than help.
 It is  barely possible, Katy, that after I have watched her a few days, if  I decide she is in genuine, sincere, heart-whole earnest, I might  introduce her and John to my friend, 'Jane.
' It is probable that if I  did, Eileen would not expect me to help her, and at the same time she  wouldn't feel that I was acting indifferently because I did not.
 We'll  wait awhile, Katy, and see whether we skid before we put on the chains.
"    "What about Marian?" inquired Katy.
    "I don't know," said Linda thoughtfully.
 "If Marian is big enough to  come here and spend the summer under the same roof with Eileen and John  Gilman, and have a really restful, enjoyable time out of it, she is  bigger than I am.
 Come up to the garret; I think Eileen has brought no  more with her than she took away.
 We'll bring her trunk down, put it  in her room and lay the keys on top.
 Don't begin by treating her as a  visitor; treat her as if she were truly my sister.
 Tell her what you  want and how you want it, exactly as you tell me and as I tell you.
 If  you see even a suspicion of any of the former objectionable tendencies  popping up, let's check them quick and hard, Katy.
"    For a week Linda watched Eileen closely.
 At the end of that time she was  sincere in her conviction that Eileen had been severely chastened.
 When  she came in contact with Peter Morrison or any other man they met she  was not immediately artificial.
 She had learned to be as natural with  men as with other women.
 There were no pretty postures, no softened  vocal modulations, no childish nonsense on subjects upon which  the average child of these days displays the knowledge of the  past-generation grandmother.
 When they visited Peter Morrison's house it  was easy to see that Eileen was interested, more interested than any  of them ever before had seen her in any subject outside of clothing and  jewels.
 Her conduct in the Strong home had been irreproachable.
 She had  cared for her own room, quietly undertaken the duties of dusting and  arranging the rooms and cutting and bringing in flowers.
 She had gone to  the kitchen and wiped dishes and asked to be taught how to cook things  of which John was particularly fond.
 She had been reasonable in the  amount of time she had spent on her shopping, and had repeatedly gone to  Linda and shown interest in her concerns.
 The result was that Linda at  once displayed the same interest in anything pertaining to Eileen.
    One afternoon Linda came home unusually early.
 She called for Eileen,  told her to tie on her sunshade and be ready for a short ride.
 Almost  immediately she brought around the Bear Cat and when they were seated  side by side headed it toward the canyon.
 She stopped at the usual  resting place, and together she and Eileen walked down the light-dappled  road bed.
 She pointed out things to Eileen, telling her what they were,  to what uses they could be put, while at the same time narrowly watching  her.
 To her amazement she found that Eileen was interested, that she was  noticing things for herself, asking what they were.
 She wanted to know  the names of the singing birds.
 When a big bird trailed a waving shadow  in front of her Linda explained how she might distinguish an eagle from  a hawk, a hawk from a vulture, a sea bird from those of the land.
 When  they reached the bridge Linda climbed down the embankment to gather  cress.
 She was moved to protest when Eileen followed and without saying  a word began to assist her, but she restrained herself, for it suddenly  occurred to her that it would be an excellent thing for Eileen to think  more of what she was doing and why she was doing it than about whether  she would wet her feet or muddy her fingers.
 So the protest became an  explanation that it was rather late for cress: the leaves toughened when  it bloomed and were too peppery.
 The only way it could be used agreeably  was to work along the edges and select the small tender shoots that had  not yet matured to the flowering point.
 When they had an armload they  went back to the car, and without any explanation Linda drove into  Los Angeles and stopped at the residence of Judge Whiting, not telling  Eileen where she was.
    "Friends of mine," said Linda lightly as she stepped from the car.
  "Fond of cress salad with their dinner.
 They prepare it after the Jane  Meredith recipe to which you called my attention, in Everybody's Home  last winter.
 Come along with me.
"    Eileen stepped from the car and followed.
 Linda led the way round the  sidewalk to where her quick ear had located voices on the side lawn.
  She stopped at the kitchen door, handed in the cress, exchanged a few  laughing words with the cook, and then presented herself at the door of  the summerhouse.
 Inside, his books and papers spread over a worktable,  sat Donald Whiting.
 One side of him his mother was busy darning his  socks; on the other his sister Louise was working with embroidery silk  and small squares of gaily colored linen.
 Linda entered with exactly  the same self-possession that characterized her at home.
 She shook hands  with Mrs. Whiting, Mary Louise, and Donald, and then she said quietly:  "Eileen and I were gathering cress and we stopped to leave you some  for your dinner.
" With this explanation she introduced Eileen to Mrs.  Whiting.
 Mary Louise immediately sprang up and recalled their meeting at  Riverside.
 Donald remembered a meeting he did not mention.
 It was only a  few minutes until Linda was seated beside Donald, interesting herself  in his lessons.
 Eileen begged to be shown the pretty handkerchiefs that  Mary Louise was making.
 An hour later Linda refused an invitation to  dinner because Katy would be expecting them.
 When she arose to go,  Eileen was carrying a small square of blue-green linen.
 Carefully pinned  to it was a patch of white with a spray of delicate flowers outlined  upon it, and a skein of pink silk thread.
 She had been initiated into  the thrillingly absorbing feminine accomplishment of making sport  handkerchiefs.
 When they left Eileen was included naturally, casually,  spontaneously, in their invitation to Linda to run in any time she  would.
 Mary Louise had said she would ride out with Donald in few days  and see how the handkerchiefs were coming on, and more instruction and  different stitches and patterns were necessary, she would love to  teach them.
 So Linda realized that Mary Louise had been told about the  trousseau.
 She knew, even lacking as she was in feminine sophistication,  that there were two open roads to the heart of a woman.
 One is a wedding  and the other is a baby.
 The lure of either is irresistible.
    As the Bear Cat glided back to Lilac Valley, Eileen sat silent.
 For ten  years she had coveted the entree to the Whiting home perhaps more than  any other in the city.
 Merely by being simple and natural, by living her  life as life presented itself each day, Linda with no effort whatever  had made possible to Eileen the thing she so deeply craved.
 Eileen was  learning a new lesson each day--some days many of them--but none  was more amazing more simple, or struck deeper into her awakened  consciousness.
 As she gazed with far-seeing eye on the blue walls of the  valley Eileen was taking a mental inventory of her former self.
 One by  one she was arraigning all the old tricks she had used in her trade of  getting on in the world.
 One by one she was discarding them in favor of  honesty, unaffectedness, and wholesome enjoyment.
    Because of these things Linda came home the next afternoon and left a  bundle on Eileen's bed before she made her way to her own room to busy  herself with a head piece for Peter's latest article.
 She had taken down  the wasp picture and while she had not destroyed it she had turned the  key of a very substantial lock upon it.
 She was hard at work when she  heard steps on the stairs.
 When Eileen entered, Linda smiled quizzically  and then broke into an unaffected ejaculation.
    "Ripping!" she cried.
 "Why, Eileen, you're perfectly topping.
"    Eileen's face flamed with delight.
 She was a challenging little figure.
  None of them was accustomed to her when she represented anything more  substantial than curls and ruffles.
    Linda reached for the telephone, called Gilman, and asked him if he  could go to the beach for supper that evening.
 He immediately replied  that he would.
 Then she called Peter Morrison and asked him the same  question and when Peter answered affirmatively she told him to bring  his car.
 Then she hastily put on her own field clothes and ran to the  kitchen to fill the lunch box.
 To Katy's delight Linda told her there  would be room for her and that she needed her.
    It was evening and the sun was moving slowly toward the horizon when  they stopped the cars and went down on the white sands of Santa Monica  Bay.
 Eileen had been complimented until she was in a glow of delight.
  She did not notice that in piling things out of the car for their beach  supper Linda had handed her a shovel and the blackened iron legs of a  broiler.
 Everyone was loaded promiscuously as they took up their march  down to as near the water's edge as the sands were dry.
 Peter and John  gathered driftwood.
 Linda improvised two cooking places, one behind a  rock for herself, the other under the little outdoor stove for Katy.
  Eileen was instructed as to how to set up the beach table, spread the  blankets beside it, and place the food upon it.
 While Katy made coffee  and toasted biscuit Linda was busy introducing her party to brigand  beefsteak upon four long steel skewers.
 The day had been warm.
 The light  salt breeze from the sea was like a benediction.
 Friendly gulls gathered  on the white sands around them.
 Cunning little sea chickens worked in  accord with the tide: when the waves advanced they rose above them on  wing; when they retreated they scampered over the wet sand, hunting any  small particles of food that might have been carried in.
 Out over the  water big brown pelicans went slowly fanning homeward; and white sea  swallows drew wonderful pictures on the blue night sky with the tips of  their wings.
 For a few minutes at the reddest point of its setting the  sun painted a marvelous picture in a bank of white clouds.
 These piled  up like a great rosy castle, and down the sky roadway before it came a  long procession of armored knights, red in the sun glow and riding huge  red horses.
 Then the colors mixed and faded and a long red bridge for a  short time spanned the water, ending at their feet.
 The gulls hunted  the last scrap thrown them and went home.
 The swallows sought their high  cliffs.
 The insidiously alluring perfume of sand verbena rose like  altar incense around them.
 Gilman spread a blanket, piled the beach fire  higher, and sitting beside Eileen, he drew her head to his shoulder  and put his arm around her.
 Possibly he could have been happier in a  careless way if he had never suffered.
 It is very probable that the  poignant depth of exquisite happiness he felt in that hour never would  have come to him had he not lost Eileen and found her again so much  more worth loving.
 Linda wandered down the beach until she reached the  lighthouse rocks.
 She climbed on a high one and sat watching the sea as  it sprayed just below.
 Peter Morrison followed her.
    "May I come up?" he asked.
    "Surely," said Linda, "this belongs to the Lord; it isn't mine.
"    So Peter climbed up and sat beside her.
    "How did the landscape appeal to you when you left the campfire?"  inquired Linda.
    "I should think the night cry might very well be Eight o'clock and all's  well," answered Peter.
    "'God's in his heaven, all's right with the world?'" Linda put it in the  form of a question.
    "It seems to be for John and Eileen," said Peter.
    "It is for a number of people," said Linda.
 "I had a letter from Marian  today.
 I had written her to ask if she would come to us for the summer,  in spite of the change in our plans; but Mr. Snow has made some plans of  his own.
 He is a very astute individual.
 He wanted Marian to marry him  at once and she would not, so he took her for a short visit to see his  daughter at her grandmother's home in the northern part of the state.
  Marian fell deeply in love with his little girl, and of course those  people found Marian charming, just as right-minded people would  find her.
 When she saw how the little girl missed her father and how  difficult it was for him to leave her, and when she saw how she would be  loved and appreciated in that fine family, she changed her mind.
 Peter,  we are going to be invited to San Francisco to see them married very  shortly.
 Are you glad or sorry?"    "I am very glad," said Peter heartily.
 "I make no concealment of my  admiration for Miss Thorne but I am very glad indeed that it is not her  head that is to complete the decoration when you start the iris marching  down my creek banks.
"    "Well, that's all right," said Linda.
 "Of course you should have  something to say about whose head finished that picture.
 I can't  contract to do more than set the iris.
 The thing about this I dread is  that Marian and Eugene are going to live in San Francisco, and I did so  want her to make her home in Lilac Valley.
"    "That's too bad," said Peter sympathetically.
 "I know how you appreciate  her, how deeply you love her.
 Do you think the valley will ever be right  for you without her, Linda?"    "It will have to be," said Linda.
 "I've had to go on without Father,  you know.
 If greater happiness seems to be in store for Marian in San  Francisco, all I can do is to efface myself and say 'Amen.
' When the  world is all right for Marian, it is about as near all right as it  can be for me.
 And did you ever see much more sincerely and clearly  contented people than John and Eileen are at the present minute?"    Peter looked at Linda whimsically.
 He lowered his voice as if a sea  urchin might hear and tattle.
    "What did you do about the wasp, Linda?" he whispered.
    "I delicately erased the stinger, fluffed up a ruffle, and put the  sketch under lock and key.
 I should have started a fire with it, but  couldn't quite bring myself to let it go, yet.
"    "Is she going to hold out?" asked Peter.
    "She'll hold out or get her neck wrung," said Linda.
 "I truly think she  has been redeemed.
 She has been born again.
 She has a new heart and a  new soul and a new impulse and a right conception of life.
 Why, Peter,  she has even got a new body.
 Her face is not the same.
"    "She is much handsomer," said Peter.
    "Isn't she?" cried Linda enthusiastically.
 "And doesn't having a soul  and doesn't thinking about essential things make the most remarkable  difference in her? It is worth going through a fiery furnace to come out  new like that.
 I called her Abednego the other day, but she didn't know  what I meant.
"    Then they sat silent and watched the sea for a long time.
  By and by the  night air grew chill.
 Peter slipped from the rock and went up the beach  and came back with an Indian blanket.
 He put it very carefully around  Linda's shoulders, and when he went to resume his seat beside her he  found one of her arms stretching it with a blanket corner for him.
 So he  sat down beside her and drew the corner over his shoulder; and because  his right arm was very much in his way, and it would have been very  disagreeable if Linda had slipped from the rock and fallen into the  cold, salt, unsympathetic Pacific at nine o'clock at night--merely to  dispose of the arm comfortably and to ensure her security, Peter put it  around Linda and drew her up beside him very close.
 Linda did not seem  to notice.
 She sat quietly looking at the Pacific and thinking her own  thoughts.
 When the fog became damp and chill, she said they must be  going, and so they went back to their cars and drove home through the  sheer wonder of the moonlight, through the perfume of the orange  orchards, hearing the night song of the mockingbirds.
        .
 The Lady of the Iris    A few days later Linda and Peter went to San Francisco and helped  celebrate the marriage of Marian and Eugene Snow.
 They left Marian in a  home carefully designed to insure every comfort and convenience she ever  had planned, furnished in accordance with her desires.
 Both Linda and  Peter were charmed with little Deborah Snow; she was a beautiful and an  appealing child.
    "It seems to me," said Linda, on the train going home, "that Marian will  get more out of life, she will love deeper, she will work harder, she  will climb higher in her profession than she would have done if she had  married John.
 It is difficult sometimes, when things are happening, to  realize that they are for the best, but I really believe this thing has  been for the level best.
 I think Marian is going to be a bigger woman in  San Francisco than she ever would have been in Lilac Valley.
 With that  thought I must reconcile myself.
"    "And what about John?" asked Peter.
 "Is he going to be a bigger man with  Eileen than he would have been with Marian?"    "No," said Linda, "he is not.
 He didn't do right and he'll have penalty  to pay.
 Eileen is developing into a lovable and truly beautiful woman,  but she has not the intellect, nor the education, nor the impulse to  stimulate a man's mental processes and make him outdo himself the way  Marian will.
 John will probably never know it, but he will have to do  his own stimulating; he will have to vision life for himself.
 He will  have to find his high hill and climb it with Eileen riding securely on  his shoulders.
 It isn't really the pleasantest thing in the world, it  isn't truly the thing I wanted to do this summer--helping them out--but  it has seemed to be the work at hand, the thing Daddy probably would  have wanted me to do, so it's up to me to do all I can for them, just  as I did all I could for Donald.
 One thing I shall always be delighted  about.
 With my own ears I heard the pronouncement: Donald had the Jap  beaten; he was at the head of his class before Oka Sayye was eliminated.
  The Jap knew it.
 His only chance lay in getting rid of his rival.
 Donald  can take the excellent record he has made in this race to start on this  fall when he commences another battle against some other man's brain for  top honors in his college.
"    "Will he start with the idea that he wants to be an honor man?"    Linda laughed outright.
    "I think," she said, "his idea was that if he were one of fifty or one  hundred leading men it would be sufficient, but I insisted that if he  wanted to be first with me, he would have to be first in his school  work.
"    "I see," said Peter.
 "Linda, have you definitely decided that when you  come to your home-making hour, Donald is the man with whom you want to  spend the remainder of your life?"    "Oh, good gracious!" said Linda.
 "Who's talking about 'homes' and  'spending the remainder of lives'? Donald and I are school friends, and  we are good companions.
 You're as bad as Eileen.
 She's always trying  to suggest things that nobody else ever thought of, and now Katy's  beginning it too.
"    "Sapheads, all!" said Peter.
 "Well, allow me to congratulate you on  having given Donald his spurs.
 I think it's a very fine thing for him  to start to college with the honor idea in his head.
 What about your  Saturday excursions?"    "They have died an unnatural death," said Linda.
 "Don and I fought for  them, but the Judge and Mrs. Whiting and Mary Louise were terrified  for fear a bone might slip in Don's foot, or some revengeful friend or  relative of Oka Sayye lie in wait for us.
 They won't hear of our going  any more.
 I go every Saturday and take Donald for a very careful drive  over a smooth road with the Bear Cat cursing our rate of speed all the  way.
 All the fun's spoiled for all three of us.
"    "Think I would be any good as a substitute when it comes to field work?"  inquired Peter casually.
 "I have looked at your desert garden so much I  would know a Cotyledon if I saw it.
 I believe I could learn.
"    "You wouldn't have time to bother," objected Linda.
 "You're a man, with  a man's business to transact in the world.
 You have to hustle and earn  money to pay for the bridge and changing the brook.
"    "But I had money to pay for the brook and the bridge before I agreed to  them," said Peter.
    "Well, then," said Linda, "you should begin to hunt old mahogany and  rugs.
"    "I hadn't intended to," said Peter; "if they are to be old, I won't have  to do more than to ship them.
 In storage in Virginia there are some very  wonderful old mahogany and rosewood and rugs and bric-a-brac enough to  furnish the house I am building.
 The stuff belonged to a little old aunt  of mine who left it to me in her will, and it was with those things  in mind that I began my house.
 The plans and finishing will fit that  furniture beautifully.
"    "Why, you lucky individual!" said Linda.
 "Nowhere in the world is there  more beautiful furniture than in some of those old homes in Virginia.
  There are old Flemish and Dutch and British and Italian pieces that  came into this country on early sailing vessels for the aristocrats.
 You  don't mean that kind of stuff, do you, Peter?"    "That is precisely the kind of stuff I do mean," answered Peter.
    "Why Peter, if you have furniture like that," cried Linda, "then all you  need is Mary Louise.
"    "Linda," said Peter soberly, "you are trespassing on delicate ground  again.
 You selected one wife for me and your plan didn't work.
 When that  furniture arrives and is installed I'll set about inducing the lady of  my dreams to come and occupy my dream house, in my own way.
 I never did  give you that job.
 It was merely assumed on your part.
"    "So it was," said Linda.
 "But you know I could set that iris and run  that brook with more enthusiasm if I knew the lady who was to walk  beside it.
"    "You do," said Peter.
 "You know her better than anyone else, even better  than I.
 Put that in your mental pipe and smoke it!"    "Saints preserve us!" cried Linda.
 "I believe the man is planning to  take Katy away from me.
"    "Not FROM you," said Peter, "WITH you.
"    "Let me know about it before you do it," said Linda with a careless  laugh.
    "That's what I'm doing right now," said Peter.
    "And I'm going to school," said Linda.
    "Of course," said Peter, "but that won't last forever.
"    Linda entered enthusiastically upon the triple task of getting Donald in  a proper frame of mind to start to college with the ambition to do good  work, of marrying off Eileen and John Gilman, and of giving her best  brain and heart to Jane Meredith.
 When the time came, Donald was ready  to enter college comfortable and happy, willing to wait and see what  life had in store for him as he lived it.
    When she was sure of Eileen past any reasonable doubt Linda took her and  John to her workroom one evening and showed them her book contract and  the material she had ready, and gave them the best idea she could  of what yet remained to be done.
 She was not prepared for their  wholehearted praise, for their delight and appreciation.
    Alone, they took counsel as to how they could best help her, and decided  that to be married at once and take a long trip abroad would be the best  way.
 That would leave Linda to work in quiet and with no interruption  to distract her attention.
 They could make their home arrangements when  they returned.
    When they had gone Linda worked persistently, but her book was not  completed and the publishers were hurrying her when the fall term  of school opened.
 By the time the final chapter with its exquisite  illustration had been sent in, the first ones were coming back in proof,  and with the proof came the materialized form of Linda's design for her  cover, and there was no Marian to consult about it.
 Linda worked until  she was confused.
 Then she piled the material in the Bear Cat and headed  up Lilac Valley.
 As she came around the curve and turned from the public  road she saw that for the first time she might cross her bridge; it was  waiting for her.
 She heard the rejoicing of the water as it fell from  stone to stone where it dipped under the road, and as she swung across  the bridge she saw that she might drive over the completed road which  had been finished in her weeks of absence.
 The windows told another  story.
 Peter's furniture had come and he had been placing it without  telling her.
 She found the front door standing wide open, so she walked  in.
 With her bundle on her arm she made her way to Peter's workroom.
  When he looked up and saw her standing in his door he sprang to his feet  and came to meet her.
    "Peter," she said, "I've taken on more work than I can possibly finish  on time, and I'm the lonesomest person in California today.
"    "I doubt that," said Peter gravely.
 "If you are any lonesomer than I am  you must prove it.
"    "I have proved it," said Linda quietly.
 "If you had been as lonesome as  I am you would have come to me.
 As it is, I have come to you.
"    "I see," said Peter rather breathlessly.
 "What have you there, Linda?  Why did you come?"    "I came for two reasons," said Linda.
 "I want to ask you about this  stuff.
 Several times this summer you have heard talk about Jane Meredith  and the Everybody's Home articles.
 Ever read any of them, Peter?"    "Yes," said Peter, "I read all of them.
 Interested in home stuff these  days myself.
"    "Well," said Linda, dumping her armload before Peter, "there's the proof  and there's the illustration and there's the cover design for a book to  be made from that stuff.
 Peter, make your best boy and say 'pleased to  meet you' to Jane Meredith.
"    Peter secured both of Linda's hands and held them.
 First he looked at  her, then he looked at the material she had piled down in front of him.
    "Never again," said Peter in a small voice, "will I credit myself with  any deep discernment, any keen penetration.
 How I could have read that  matter and looked at those pictures and not seen you in and through  and over them is a thing I can't imagine.
 It's great, Linda, absolutely  great! Of course I will help you any way in the world I can.
 And what  else was it you wanted? You said two things.
"    "Oh, the other doesn't amount to much," said Linda.
 "I only wanted the  comfort of knowing whether, as soon as I graduate, I may take Katy and  come home, Peter.
"    From previous experience with Linda, Peter had learned that a girl  reared by men is not as other women.
 He had supposed the other thing  concerning which she had wanted to appeal to him was on par with her  desire for sympathy and help concerning her book.
 At her question, with  her eyes frankly meeting his, Peter for an instant felt lightheaded.
 He  almost dodged, he was so sweepingly taken unawares.
 Linda was waiting  and his brain was not working.
 He tried to smile, but he knew she would  not recognize as natural the expression of that whirling moment.
 She saw  his hesitation.
    "Of course, if you don't want us, Peter--"    Peter found his voice promptly.
 Only his God knew how much he wanted  Linda, but there were conditions that a man of Peter's soul-fiber  could not endure.
 More than life he wanted her, but he did not want  her asleep.
 He did not want to risk her awakening to a spoiled life and  disappointed hopes.
    "But you remember that I told you coming home from San Francisco that  you knew the Lady of my Iris better than anyone else, and that I was  planning to take Katy, not from you, but with you.
"    "Of course I remember," said Linda.
 "That is why when Marian and Eileen  and Donald and all my world went past and left me standing desolate, and  my work piled up until I couldn't see my way, I just started right out  to ask you if you would help me with the proof.
 Of course I knew you  would be glad to do that and I thought if you really meant in your  heart that I was the one to complete your iris procession, it would be a  comfort to me during the hard work and the lonesome days to have it put  in two-syllable English.
 Marian said that was the only real way--"    "And Marian is eminently correct.
 You will have to give me an ordinary  lifetime, Linda, in which to try to make you understand exactly what  this means to me.
 Perhaps I'll even have to invent new words in which to  express myself.
"    "Oh, that's all right," said Linda.
 "It means a lot to me too.
 I can't  tell you how much I think of you.
 That first day, as soon as I put down  the Cotyledon safely and tucked in my blouse, I would have put my hand  in yours and started around the world, if you had asked me to.
 I have  the very highest esteem for you, Peter.
"    "Esteem, yes," said Peter slowly.
 "But Linda-girl, isn't the sort of  alliance I am asking you to enter with me usually based on something a  good bit stronger than 'esteem'?"    "Yes, I think it is," said Linda.
 "But you needn't worry.
 I only wanted  the comfort of knowing that I was not utterly alone again, save for  Katy.
 I'll stick to my book and to my fight for Senior honors all  right.
"    Peter was blinking his eyes and fighting to breathe evenly.
 When he  could speak he said as smoothly as possible: "Of course, Linda.
 I'll  do your proof for you and you may put all your time on class honors.
  It merely occurred to me to wonder whether you realized the full and  ultimate significance of what we are saying; exactly what it means to me  and to you.
"     "Possibly not, Peter," said Linda, smiling on him with utter  confidence.
 "Everyone says I am my father's daughter, and Father didn't  live to coach me on being your iris decoration, as a woman would; but,  Peter, when the time comes, I have every confidence in your ability to  teach me what you would like me to know yourself.
 Don't you agree with  me, Peter?"    Making an effort to control himself Peter gathered up the material Linda  had brought and taking her arm he said casually: "I thoroughly agree  with you, dear.
 You are sanely and health fully and beautifully right.
  Now let's go and take Katy into our confidence, and then you shall show  me your ideas before I begin work on your proof.
 And after this, instead  of you coming to me I shall always come to you whenever you can spare a  minute for me.
"    Linda nodded acquiescence.
    "Of course! That would be best," she said.
 "Peter, you are so  satisfyingly satisfactory.
"            .

 The Life Force  either will not or cannot achieve immortality except in very low  organisms: indeed it is by no means ascertained that even the amoeba is  immortal.
 Human beings visibly wear out, though they last longer than  their friends the dogs.
 Turtles, parrots, and elephants are believed to  be capable of outliving the memory of the oldest human inhabitant.
 But  the fact that new ones are born conclusively proves that they are not  immortal.
 Do away with death and you do away with the need for birth: in  fact if you went on breeding, you would finally have to kill old people  to make room for young ones.
    Now death is not necessarily a failure of energy on the part of the Life  Force.
 People with no imagination try to make things which will last for  ever, and even want to live for ever themselves.
 But the intelligently  imaginative man knows very well that it is waste of labor to make a  machine that will last ten years, because it will probably be superseded  in half that time by an improved machine answering the same purpose.
  He also knows that if some devil were to convince us that our dream  of personal immortality is no dream but a hard fact, such a shriek of  despair would go up from the human race as no other conceivable horror  could provoke.
 With all our perverse nonsense as to John Smith living  for a thousand million eons and for ever after, we die voluntarily,  knowing that it is time for us to be scrapped, to be remanufactured, to  come back, as Wordsworth divined, trailing ever brightening clouds of  glory.
 We must all be born again, and yet again and again.
 We should  like to live a little longer just as we should like 50 pounds: that is,  we should take it if we could get it for nothing; but that sort of idle  liking is not will.
 It is amazing--considering the way we talk--how  little a man will do to get 50 pounds: all the 50-pound notes I have  ever known of have been more easily earned than a laborious sixpence;  but the difficulty of inducing a man to make any serious effort to  obtain 50 pounds is nothing to the difficulty of inducing him to make a  serious effort to keep alive.
 The moment he sees death approach, he gets  into bed and sends for a doctor.
 He knows very well at the back of  his conscience that he is rather a poor job and had better be  remanufactured.
 He knows that his death will make room for a birth; and  he hopes that it will be a birth of something that he aspired to be and  fell short of.
 He knows that it is through death and rebirth that  this corruptible shall become incorruptible, and this mortal put on  immortality.
 Practise as you will on his ignorance, his fears, and his  imagination, with bribes of paradises and threats of hells, there is  only one belief that can rob death of its sting and the grave of its  victory; and that is the belief that we can lay down the burden of our  wretched little makeshift individualities for ever at each lift towards  the goal of evolution, which can only be a being that cannot be improved  upon.
 After all, what man is capable of the insane self-conceit of  believing that an eternity of himself would be tolerable even to  himself? Those who try to believe it postulate that they shall be made  perfect first.
 But if you make me perfect I shall no longer be myself,  nor will it be possible for me to conceive my present imperfections (and  what I cannot conceive I cannot remember); so that you may just as well  give me a new name and face the fact that I am a new person and that  the old Bernard Shaw is as dead as mutton.
 Thus, oddly enough, the  conventional belief in the matter comes to this: that if you wish to  live for ever you must be wicked enough to be irretrievably damned,  since the saved are no longer what they were, and in hell alone do  people retain their sinful nature: that is to say, their individuality.
  And this sort of hell, however convenient as a means of intimidating  persons who have practically no honor and no conscience, is not a fact.
  Death is for many of us the gate of hell; but we are inside on the way  out, not outside on the way in.
 Therefore let us give up telling one  another idle stories, and rejoice in death as we rejoice in birth; for  without death we cannot be born again; and the man who does not wish  to be born again and born better is fit only to represent the City of  London in Parliament, or perhaps the university of Oxford.
          The Child is Father to the Man    Is he? Then in the name of common sense why do we always treat children  on the assumption that the man is father to the child? Oh, these  fathers! And we are not content with fathers: we must have godfathers,  forgetting that the child is godfather to the man.
 Has it ever struck  you as curious that in a country where the first article of belief is  that every child is born with a godfather whom we all call "our father  which art in heaven," two very limited individual mortals should  be allowed to appear at its baptism and explain that they are its  godparents, and that they will look after its salvation until it is no  longer a child.
 I had a godmother who made herself responsible in this  way for me.
 She presented me with a Bible with a gilt clasp and edges,  larger than the Bibles similarly presented to my sisters, because my sex  entitled me to a heavier article.
 I must have seen that lady at least  four times in the twenty years following.
 She never alluded to my  salvation in any way.
 People occasionally ask me to act as godfather to  their children with a levity which convinces me that they have not the  faintest notion that it involves anything more than calling the helpless  child George Bernard without regard to the possibility that it may grow  up in the liveliest abhorrence of my notions.
    A person with a turn for logic might argue that if God is the Father of  all men, and if the child is father to the man, it follows that the true  representative of God at the christening is the child itself.
 But such  posers are unpopular, because they imply that our little customs, or,  as we often call them, our religion, mean something, or must originally  have meant something, and that we understand and believe that something.
    However, my business is not to make confusion worse confounded, but to  clear it up.
 Only, it is as well to begin by a sample of current thought  and practice which shews that on the subject of children we are very  deeply confused.
 On the whole, whatever our theory or no theory may  be, our practice is to treat the child as the property of its immediate  physical parents, and to allow them to do what they like with it as far  as it will let them.
 It has no rights and no liberties: in short, its  condition is that which adults recognize as the most miserable and  dangerous politically possible for themselves: namely, the condition of  slavery.
 For its alleviation we trust to the natural affection of the  parties, and to public opinion.
 A father cannot for his own credit let  his son go in rags.
 Also, in a very large section of the population,  parents finally become dependent on their children.
 Thus there are  checks on child slavery which do not exist, or are less powerful, in the  case of manual and industrial slavery.
 Sensationally bad cases fall into  two classes, which are really the same class: namely, the children  whose parents are excessively addicted to the sensual luxury of petting  children, and the children whose parents are excessively addicted to the  sensual luxury of physically torturing them.
 There is a Society for the  Prevention of Cruelty to Children which has effectually made an end of  our belief that mothers are any more to be trusted than stepmothers, or  fathers than slave-drivers.
 And there is a growing body of law designed  to prevent parents from using their children ruthlessly to make money  for the household.
 Such legislation has always been furiously resisted  by the parents, even when the horrors of factory slavery were at  their worst; and the extension of such legislation at present would be  impossible if it were not that the parents affected by it cannot control  a majority of votes in Parliament.
 In domestic life a great deal of  service is done by children, the girls acting as nursemaids and general  servants, and the lads as errand boys.
 In the country both boys and  girls do a substantial share of farm labor.
 This is why it is necessary  to coerce poor parents to send their children to school, though in the  relatively small class which keeps plenty of servants it is impossible  to induce parents to keep their children at home instead of paying  schoolmasters to take them off their hands.
    It appears then that the bond of affection between parents and children  does not save children from the slavery that denial of rights involves  in adult political relations.
 It sometimes intensifies it, sometimes  mitigates it; but on the whole children and parents confront one another  as two classes in which all the political power is on one side; and  the results are not at all unlike what they would be if there were no  immediate consanguinity between them, and one were white and the other  black, or one enfranchised and the other disenfranchised, or one ranked  as gentle and the other simple.
 Not that Nature counts for nothing in  the case and political rights for everything.
 But a denial of political  rights, and the resultant delivery of one class into the mastery of  another, affects their relations so extensively and profoundly that it  is impossible to ascertain what the real natural relations of the two  classes are until this political relation is abolished.
          What is a Child?    An experiment.
 A fresh attempt to produce the just man made perfect:  that is, to make humanity divine.
 And you will vitiate the experiment  if you make the slightest attempt to abort it into some fancy figure of  your own: for example, your notion of a good man or a womanly woman.
  If you treat it as a little wild beast to be tamed, or as a pet to be  played with, or even as a means to save you trouble and to make money  for you (and these are our commonest ways), it may fight its way through  in spite of you and save its soul alive; for all its instincts will  resist you, and possibly be strengthened in the resistance; but if you  begin with its own holiest aspirations, and suborn them for your own  purposes, then there is hardly any limit to the mischief you may do.
  Swear at a child, throw your boots at it, send it flying from the room  with a cuff or a kick; and the experience will be as instructive to the  child as a difficulty with a short-tempered dog or a bull.
 Francis Place  tells us that his father always struck his children when he found one  within his reach.
 The effect on the young Places seems to have been  simply to make them keep out of their father's way, which was no doubt  what he desired, as far as he desired anything at all.
 Francis records  the habit without bitterness, having reason to thank his stars that his  father respected the inside of his head whilst cuffing the outside of  it; and this made it easy for Francis to do yeoman's service to his  country as that rare and admirable thing, a Freethinker: the only  sort of thinker, I may remark, whose thoughts, and consequently whose  religious convictions, command any respect.
    Now Mr Place, senior, would be described by many as a bad father; and  I do not contend that he was a conspicuously good one.
 But as compared  with the conventional good father who deliberately imposes himself on  his son as a god; who takes advantage of childish credulity and parent  worship to persuade his son that what he approves of is right and what  he disapproves of is wrong; who imposes a corresponding conduct on the  child by a system of prohibitions and penalties, rewards and eulogies,  for which he claims divine sanction: compared to this sort of  abortionist and monster maker, I say, Place appears almost as a  Providence.
 Not that it is possible to live with children any more than  with grown-up people without imposing rules of conduct on them.
 There  is a point at which every person with human nerves has to say to a child  "Stop that noise.
" But suppose the child asks why! There are various  answers in use.
 The simplest: "Because it irritates me," may fail; for  it may strike the child as being rather amusing to irritate you; also  the child, having comparatively no nerves, may be unable to conceive  your meaning vividly enough.
 In any case it may want to make a noise  more than to spare your feelings.
 You may therefore have to explain  that the effect of the irritation will be that you will do something  unpleasant if the noise continues.
 The something unpleasant may be only  a look of suffering to rouse the child's affectionate sympathy (if it  has any), or it may run to forcible expulsion from the room with plenty  of unnecessary violence; but the principle is the same: there are no  false pretences involved: the child learns in a straightforward way that  it does not pay to be inconsiderate.
 Also, perhaps, that Mamma, who made  the child learn the Sermon on the Mount, is not really a Christian.
          The Sin of Nadab and Abihu    But there is another sort of answer in wide use which is neither  straightforward, instructive, nor harmless.
 In its simplest form it  substitutes for "Stop that noise," "Dont be naughty," which means that  the child, instead of annoying you by a perfectly healthy and natural  infantile procedure, is offending God.
 This is a blasphemous lie; and  the fact that it is on the lips of every nurserymaid does not excuse it  in the least.
 Dickens tells us of a nurserymaid who elaborated it into  "If you do that, angels wont never love you.
" I remember a servant who  used to tell me that if I were not good, by which she meant if I did  not behave with a single eye to her personal convenience, the cock would  come down the chimney.
 Less imaginative but equally dishonest people  told me I should go to hell if I did not make myself agreeable to them.
  Bodily violence, provided it be the hasty expression of normal provoked  resentment and not vicious cruelty, cannot harm a child as this sort of  pious fraud harms it.
 There is a legal limit to physical cruelty; and  there are also human limits to it.
 There is an active Society which  brings to book a good many parents who starve and torture and overwork  their children, and intimidates a good many more.
 When parents of this  type are caught, they are treated as criminals; and not infrequently  the police have some trouble to save them from being lynched.
 The  people against whom children are wholly unprotected are those who devote  themselves to the very mischievous and cruel sort of abortion which is  called bringing up a child in the way it should go.
 Now nobody knows  the way a child should go.
 All the ways discovered so far lead to the  horrors of our existing civilizations, described quite justifiably by  Ruskin as heaps of agonizing human maggots, struggling with one another  for scraps of food.
 Pious fraud is an attempt to pervert that precious  and sacred thing the child's conscience into an instrument of our own  convenience, and to use that wonderful and terrible power called Shame  to grind our own axe.
 It is the sin of stealing fire from the altar: a  sin so impudently practised by popes, parents, and pedagogues, that one  can hardly expect the nurserymaids to see any harm in stealing a few  cinders when they are worrited.
    Into the blackest depths of this violation of children's souls one can  hardly bear to look; for here we find pious fraud masking the violation  of the body by obscene cruelty.
 Any parent or school teacher who takes  a secret and abominable delight in torture is allowed to lay traps into  which every child must fall, and then beat it to his or her heart's  content.
 A gentleman once wrote to me and said, with an obvious  conviction that he was being most reasonable and high minded, that the  only thing he beat his children for was failure in perfect obedience and  perfect truthfulness.
 On these attributes, he said, he must insist.
 As  one of them is not a virtue at all, and the other is the attribute of a  god, one can imagine what the lives of this gentleman's children would  have been if it had been possible for him to live down to his monstrous  and foolish pretensions.
 And yet he might have written his letter to The  Times (he very nearly did, by the way) without incurring any danger of  being removed to an asylum, or even losing his reputation for taking  a very proper view of his parental duties.
 And at least it was not a  trivial view, nor an ill meant one.
 It was much more respectable than  the general consensus of opinion that if a school teacher can devise a  question a child cannot answer, or overhear it calling omega omeega,  he or she may beat the child viciously.
 Only, the cruelty must be  whitewashed by a moral excuse, and a pretence of reluctance.
 It must be  for the child's good.
 The assailant must say "This hurts me more than  it hurts you.
" There must be hypocrisy as well as cruelty.
 The injury to  the child would be far less if the voluptuary said frankly "I beat you  because I like beating you; and I shall do it whenever I can contrive  an excuse for it.
" But to represent this detestable lust to the child  as Divine wrath, and the cruelty as the beneficent act of God, which is  exactly what all our floggers do, is to add to the torture of the body,  out of which the flogger at least gets some pleasure, the maiming and  blinding of the child's soul, which can bring nothing but horror to  anyone.
          The Manufacture of Monsters    This industry is by no means peculiar to China.
 The Chinese (they say)  make physical monsters.
 We revile them for it and proceed to make moral  monsters of our own children.
 The most excusable parents are those who  try to correct their own faults in their offspring.
 The parent who says  to his child: "I am one of the successes of the Almighty: therefore  imitate me in every particular or I will have the skin off your back"  (a quite common attitude) is a much more absurd figure than the man who,  with a pipe in his mouth, thrashes his boy for smoking.
 If you must hold  yourself up to your children as an object lesson (which is not at all  necessary), hold yourself up as a warning and not as an example.
 But  you had much better let the child's character alone.
 If you once allow  yourself to regard a child as so much material for you to manufacture  into any shape that happens to suit your fancy you are defeating the  experiment of the Life Force.
 You are assuming that the child does  not know its own business, and that you do.
 In this you are sure to be  wrong: the child feels the drive of the Life Force (often called the  Will of God); and you cannot feel it for him.
 Handel's parents no doubt  thought they knew better than their child when they tried to prevent  his becoming a musician.
 They would have been equally wrong and equally  unsuccessful if they had tried to prevent the child becoming a great  rascal had its genius lain in that direction.
 Handel would have been  Handel, and Napoleon and Peter of Russia _them_selves in spite of all  the parents in creation, because, as often happens, they were stronger  than their parents.
 But this does not happen always.
 Most children  can be, and many are, hopelessly warped and wasted by parents who are  ignorant and silly enough to suppose that they know what a human being  ought to be, and who stick at nothing in their determination to force  their children into their moulds.
 Every child has a right to its own  bent.
 It has a right to be a Plymouth Brother though its parents be  convinced atheists.
 It has a right to dislike its mother or father or  sister or brother or uncle or aunt if they are antipathetic to it.
 It  has a right to find its own way and go its own way, whether that way  seems wise or foolish to others, exactly as an adult has.
 It has a right  to privacy as to its own doings and its own affairs as much as if it  were its own father.
          Small and Large Families    These rights have now become more important than they used to be,  because the modern practice of limiting families enables them to be  more effectually violated.
 In a family of ten, eight, six, or even four  children, the rights of the younger ones to a great extent take care of  themselves and of the rights of the elder ones too.
 Two adult parents,  in spite of a house to keep and an income to earn, can still interfere  to a disastrous extent with the rights and liberties of one child.
 But  by the time a fourth child has arrived, they are not only outnumbered  two to one, but are getting tired of the thankless and mischievous job  of bringing up their children in the way they think they should go.
 The  old observation that members of large families get on in the world  holds good because in large families it is impossible for each child to  receive what schoolmasters call "individual attention.
" The children  may receive a good deal of individual attention from one another in the  shape of outspoken reproach, ruthless ridicule, and violent resistance  to their attempts at aggression; but the parental despots are compelled  by the multitude of their subjects to resort to political rather than  personal rule, and to spread their attempts at moral monster-making over  so many children, that each child has enough freedom, and enough sport  in the prophylactic process of laughing at its elders behind their  backs, to escape with much less damage than the single child.
 In a large  school the system may be bad; but the personal influence of the head  master has to be exerted, when it is exerted at all, in a public way,  because he has little more power of working on the affections of the  individual scholar in the intimate way that, for example, the mother  of a single child can, than the prime minister has of working on the  affections of any individual voter.
          Children as Nuisances    Experienced parents, when children's rights are preached to them, very  naturally ask whether children are to be allowed to do what they like.
  The best reply is to ask whether adults are to be allowed to do what  they like.
 The two cases are the same.
 The adult who is nasty is not  allowed to do what he likes: neither can the child who likes to be  nasty.
 There is no difference in principle between the rights of a  child and those of an adult: the difference in their cases is one of  circumstance.
 An adult is not supposed to be punished except by process  of law; nor, when he is so punished, is the person whom he has injured  allowed to act as judge, jury, and executioner.
 It is true that  employers do act in this way every day to their workpeople; but this is  not a justified and intended part of the situation: it is an abuse  of Capitalism which nobody defends in principle.
 As between child and  parent or nurse it is not argued about because it is inevitable.
 You  cannot hold an impartial judicial inquiry every time a child misbehaves  itself.
 To allow the child to misbehave without instantly making it  unpleasantly conscious of the fact would be to spoil it.
 The adult has  therefore to take action of some sort with nothing but his conscience  to shield the child from injustice or unkindness.
 The action may be a  torrent of scolding culminating in a furious smack causing terror  and pain, or it may be a remonstrance causing remorse, or it may be a  sarcasm causing shame and humiliation, or it may be a sermon causing the  child to believe that it is a little reprobate on the road to hell.
 The  child has no defence in any case except the kindness and conscience of  the adult; and the adult had better not forget this; for it involves a  heavy responsibility.
    And now comes our difficulty.
 The responsibility, being so heavy, cannot  be discharged by persons of feeble character or intelligence.
 And yet  people of high character and intelligence cannot be plagued with the  care of children.
 A child is a restless, noisy little animal, with  an insatiable appetite for knowledge, and consequently a maddening  persistence in asking questions.
 If the child is to remain in the room  with a highly intelligent and sensitive adult, it must be told, and if  necessary forced, to sit still and not speak, which is injurious to  its health, unnatural, unjust, and therefore cruel and selfish beyond  toleration.
 Consequently the highly intelligent and sensitive adult  hands the child over to a nurserymaid who has no nerves and can  therefore stand more noise, but who has also no scruples, and may  therefore be very bad company for the child.
    Here we have come to the central fact of the question: a fact nobody  avows, which is yet the true explanation of the monstrous system of  child imprisonment and torture which we disguise under such hypocrisies  as education, training, formation of character and the rest of it.
 This  fact is simply that a child is a nuisance to a grown-up person.
 What  is more, the nuisance becomes more and more intolerable as the grown-up  person becomes more cultivated, more sensitive, and more deeply engaged  in the highest methods of adult work.
 The child at play is noisy and  ought to be noisy: Sir Isaac Newton at work is quiet and ought to be  quiet.
 And the child should spend most of its time at play, whilst the  adult should spend most of his time at work.
 I am not now writing on  behalf of persons who coddle themselves into a ridiculous condition of  nervous feebleness, and at last imagine themselves unable to work  under conditions of bustle which to healthy people are cheerful and  stimulating.
 I am sure that if people had to choose between living where  the noise of children never stopped and where it was never heard, all  the goodnatured and sound people would prefer the incessant noise to the  incessant silence.
 But that choice is not thrust upon us by the nature  of things.
 There is no reason why children and adults should not see  just as much of one another as is good for them, no more and no less.
  Even at present you are not compelled to choose between sending your  child to a boarding school (which means getting rid of it altogether on  more or less hypocritical pretences) and keeping it continually at home.
  Most working folk today either send their children to day schools or  turn them out of doors.
 This solves the problem for the parents.
 It does  not solve it for the children, any more than the tethering of a goat in  a field or the chasing of an unlicensed dog into the streets solves  it for the goat or the dog; but it shews that in no class are people  willing to endure the society of their children, and consequently  that it is an error to believe that the family provides children with  edifying adult society, or that the family is a social unit.
 The family  is in that, as in so many other respects, a humbug.
 Old people and young  people cannot walk at the same pace without distress and final loss of  health to one of the parties.
 When they are sitting indoors they cannot  endure the same degrees of temperature and the same supplies of  fresh air.
 Even if the main factors of noise, restlessness, and  inquisitiveness are left out of account, children can stand with  indifference sights, sounds, smells, and disorders that would make an  adult of fifty utterly miserable; whilst on the other hand such  adults find a tranquil happiness in conditions which to children mean  unspeakable boredom.
 And since our system is nevertheless to pack them  all into the same house and pretend that they are happy, and that this  particular sort of happiness is the foundation of virtue, it is found  that in discussing family life we never speak of actual adults or actual  children, or of realities of any sort, but always of ideals such as  The Home, a Mother's Influence, a Father's Care, Filial Piety, Duty,  Affection, Family Life, etc.
 etc.
, which are no doubt very comforting  phrases, but which beg the question of what a home and a mother's  influence and a father's care and so forth really come to in practice.
  How many hours a week of the time when his children are out of bed does  the ordinary bread-winning father spend in the company of his children  or even in the same building with them? The home may be a thieves'  kitchen, the mother a procuress, the father a violent drunkard; or the  mother and father may be fashionable people who see their children three  or four times a year during the holidays, and then not oftener than  they can help, living meanwhile in daily and intimate contact with their  valets and lady's-maids, whose influence and care are often dominant in  the household.
 Affection, as distinguished from simple kindliness, may  or may not exist: when it does it either depends on qualities in the  parties that would produce it equally if they were of no kin to one  another, or it is a more or less morbid survival of the nursing passion;  for affection between adults (if they are really adult in mind and not  merely grown-up children) and creatures so relatively selfish and cruel  as children necessarily are without knowing it or meaning it, cannot be  called natural: in fact the evidence shews that it is easier to love the  company of a dog than of a commonplace child between the ages of six and  the beginnings of controlled maturity; for women who cannot bear to be  separated from their pet dogs send their children to boarding schools  cheerfully.
 They may say and even believe that in allowing their  children to leave home they are sacrificing themselves for their  children's good; but there are very few pet dogs who would not be  the better for a month or two spent elsewhere than in a lady's lap or  roasting on a drawingroom hearthrug.
 Besides, to allege that children  are better continually away from home is to give up the whole popular  sentimental theory of the family; yet the dogs are kept and the children  are banished.
          Child Fanciers    There is, however, a good deal of spurious family affection.
 There is  the clannishness that will make a dozen brothers and sisters who quarrel  furiously among themselves close up their ranks and make common cause  against a brother-in-law or a sister-in-law.
 And there is a strong sense  of property in children, which often makes mothers and fathers bitterly  jealous of allowing anyone else to interfere with their children, whom  they may none the less treat very badly.
 And there is an extremely  dangerous craze for children which leads certain people to establish  orphanages and baby farms and schools, seizing any pretext for filling  their houses with children exactly as some eccentric old ladies and  gentlemen fill theirs with cats.
 In such places the children are the  victims of all the caprices of doting affection and all the excesses  of lascivious cruelty.
 Yet the people who have this morbid craze seldom  have any difficulty in finding victims.
 Parents and guardians are so  worried by children and so anxious to get rid of them that anyone who  is willing to take them off their hands is welcomed and whitewashed.
  The very people who read with indignation of Squeers and Creakle in the  novels of Dickens are quite ready to hand over their own children  to Squeers and Creakle, and to pretend that Squeers and Creakle  are monsters of the past.
 But read the autobiography of Stanley the  traveller, or sit in the company of men talking about their school-days,  and you will soon find that fiction, which must, if it is to be sold and  read, stop short of being positively sickening, dare not tell the whole  truth about the people to whom children are handed over on educational  pretexts.
 Not very long ago a schoolmaster in Ireland was murdered by  his boys; and for reasons which were never made public it was at  first decided not to prosecute the murderers.
 Yet all these flogging  schoolmasters and orphanage fiends and baby farmers are "lovers of  children.
" They are really child fanciers (like bird fanciers or dog  fanciers) by irresistible natural predilection, never happy unless they  are surrounded by their victims, and always certain to make their living  by accepting the custody of children, no matter how many alternative  occupations may be available.
 And bear in mind that they are only  the extreme instances of what is commonly called natural affection,  apparently because it is obviously unnatural.
    The really natural feeling of adults for children in the long prosaic  intervals between the moments of affectionate impulse is just that  feeling that leads them to avoid their care and constant company as a  burden beyond bearing, and to pretend that the places they send them to  are well conducted, beneficial, and indispensable to the success of the  children in after life.
 The true cry of the kind mother after her little  rosary of kisses is "Run away, darling.
" It is nicer than "Hold  your noise, you young devil; or it will be the worse for you"; but  fundamentally it means the same thing: that if you compel an adult and  a child to live in one another's company either the adult or the child  will be miserable.
 There is nothing whatever unnatural or wrong or  shocking in this fact; and there is no harm in it if only it be sensibly  faced and provided for.
 The mischief that it does at present is  produced by our efforts to ignore it, or to smother it under a heap of  sentimental lies and false pretences.
          Childhood as a State of Sin    Unfortunately all this nonsense tends to accumulate as we become more  sympathetic.
 In many families it is still the custom to treat childhood  frankly as a state of sin, and impudently proclaim the monstrous  principle that little children should be seen and not heard, and to  enforce a set of prison rules designed solely to make cohabitation  with children as convenient as possible for adults without the smallest  regard for the interests, either remote or immediate, of the  children.
 This system tends to produce a tough, rather brutal, stupid,  unscrupulous class, with a fixed idea that all enjoyment consists in  undetected sinning; and in certain phases of civilization people of this  kind are apt to get the upper hand of more amiable and conscientious  races and classes.
 They have the ferocity of a chained dog, and are  proud of it.
 But the end of it is that they are always in chains,  even at the height of their military or political success: they  win everything on condition that they are afraid to enjoy it.
 Their  civilizations rest on intimidation, which is so necessary to them that  when they cannot find anybody brave enough to intimidate them they  intimidate themselves and live in a continual moral and political panic.
  In the end they get found out and bullied.
 But that is not the point  that concerns us here, which is, that they are in some respects better  brought up than the children of sentimental people who are always  anxious and miserable about their duty to their children, and who end  by neither making their children happy nor having a tolerable life for  themselves.
 A selfish tyrant you know where to have, and he (or she) at  least does not confuse your affections; but a conscientious and kindly  meddler may literally worry you out of your senses.
 It is fortunate that  only very few parents are capable of doing what they conceive their duty  continuously or even at all, and that still fewer are tough enough to  ride roughshod over their children at home.
          School    But please observe the limitation "at home.
" What private amateur  parental enterprise cannot do may be done very effectively by organized  professional enterprise in large institutions established for the  purpose.
 And it is to such professional enterprise that parents hand  over their children when they can afford it.
 They send their children  to school; and there is, on the whole, nothing on earth intended for  innocent people so horrible as a school.
 To begin with, it is a prison.
  But it is in some respects more cruel than a prison.
 In a prison, for  instance, you are not forced to read books written by the warders and  the governor (who of course would not be warders and governors if they  could write readable books), and beaten or otherwise tormented if you  cannot remember their utterly unmemorable contents.
 In the prison you  are not forced to sit listening to turnkeys discoursing without charm or  interest on subjects that they dont understand and dont care about, and  are therefore incapable of making you understand or care about.
 In a  prison they may torture your body; but they do not torture your brains;  and they protect you against violence and outrage from your fellow  prisoners.
 In a school you have none of these advantages.
 With the  world's bookshelves loaded with fascinating and inspired books, the very  manna sent down from Heaven to feed your souls, you are forced to read  a hideous imposture called a school book, written by a man who cannot  write: a book from which no human being can learn anything: a book  which, though you may decipher it, you cannot in any fruitful sense  read, though the enforced attempt will make you loathe the sight of  a book all the rest of your life.
 With millions of acres of woods and  valleys and hills and wind and air and birds and streams and fishes and  all sorts of instructive and healthy things easily accessible, or with  streets and shop windows and crowds and vehicles and all sorts of city  delights at the door, you are forced to sit, not in a room with some  human grace and comfort or furniture and decoration, but in a stalled  pound with a lot of other children, beaten if you talk, beaten if you  move, beaten if you cannot prove by answering idiotic questions that  even when you escaped from the pound and from the eye of your gaoler,  you were still agonizing over his detestable sham books instead of  daring to live.
 And your childish hatred of your gaoler and flogger is  nothing to his adult hatred of you; for he is a slave forced to endure  your society for his daily bread.
 You have not even the satisfaction of  knowing how you are torturing him and how he loathes you; and you give  yourself unnecessary pains to annoy him with furtive tricks and spiteful  doing of forbidden things.
 No wonder he is sometimes provoked to  fiendish outbursts of wrath.
 No wonder men of downright sense, like Dr  Johnson, admit that under such circumstances children will not learn  anything unless they are so cruelly beaten that they make desperate  efforts to memorize words and phrases to escape flagellation.
 It is a  ghastly business, quite beyond words, this schooling.
    And now I hear cries of protest arising all round.
 First my own  schoolmasters, or their ghosts, asking whether I was cruelly beaten at  school? No; but then I did not learn anything at school.
 Dr Johnson's  schoolmaster presumably did care enough whether Sam learned anything to  beat him savagely enough to force him to lame his mind--for  Johnson's great mind _was_ lamed--by learning his lessons.
 None of my  schoolmasters really cared a rap (or perhaps it would be fairer to them  to say that their employers did not care a rap and therefore did not  give them the necessary caning powers) whether I learnt my lessons or  not, provided my father paid my schooling bill, the collection of which  was the real object of the school.
 Consequently I did not learn my  school lessons, having much more important ones in hand, with the result  that I have not wasted my life trifling with literary fools in taverns  as Johnson did when he should have been shaking England with the thunder  of his spirit.
 My schooling did me a great deal of harm and no good  whatever: it was simply dragging a child's soul through the dirt; but I  escaped Squeers and Creakle just as I escaped Johnson and Carlyle.
 And  this is what happens to most of us.
 We are not effectively coerced to  learn: we stave off punishment as far as we can by lying and trickery  and guessing and using our wits; and when this does not suffice we  scribble impositions, or suffer extra imprisonments--"keeping in" was  the phrase in my time--or let a master strike us with a cane and fall  back on our pride at being able to hear it physically (he not being  allowed to hit us too hard) to outface the dishonor we should have been  taught to die rather than endure.
 And so idleness and worthlessness on  the one hand and a pretence of coercion on the other became a despicable  routine.
 If my schoolmasters had been really engaged in educating me  instead of painfully earning their bread by keeping me from annoying my  elders they would have turned me out of the school, telling me that I  was thoroughly disloyal to it; that I had no intention of learning; that  I was mocking and distracting the boys who did wish to learn; that I was  a liar and a shirker and a seditious little nuisance; and that nothing  could injure me in character and degrade their occupation more than  allowing me (much less forcing me) to remain in the school under such  conditions.
 But in order to get expelled, it was necessary commit  a crime of such atrocity that the parents of other boys would  have threatened to remove their sons sooner than allow them to be  schoolfellows with the delinquent.
 I can remember only one case in which  such a penalty was threatened; and in that case the culprit, a boarder,  had kissed a housemaid, or possibly, being a handsome youth, been kissed  by her.
 She did not kiss me; and nobody ever dreamt of expelling me.
 The  truth was, a boy meant just so much a year to the institution.
 That was  why he was kept there against his will.
 That was why he was kept there  when his expulsion would have been an unspeakable relief and benefit  both to his teachers and himself.
    It may be argued that if the uncommercial attitude had been taken,  and all the disloyal wasters and idlers shewn sternly to the door,  the school would not have been emptied, but filled.
 But so honest an  attitude was impossible.
 The masters must have hated the school much  more than the boys did.
 Just as you cannot imprison a man without  imprisoning a warder to see that he does not escape, the warder being  tied to the prison as effectually by the fear of unemployment and  starvation as the prisoner is by the bolts and bars, so these poor  schoolmasters, with their small salaries and large classes, were as much  prisoners as we were, and much more responsible and anxious ones.
 They  could not impose the heroic attitude on their employers; nor would they  have been able to obtain places as schoolmasters if their habits had  been heroic.
 For the best of them their employment was provisional: they  looked forward to escaping from it into the pulpit.
 The ablest and most  impatient of them were often so irritated by the awkward, slow-witted,  slovenly boys: that is, the ones that required special consideration and  patient treatment, that they vented their irritation on them ruthlessly,  nothing being easier than to entrap or bewilder such a boy into giving a  pretext for punishing him.
          My Scholastic Acquirements    The results, as far as I was concerned, were what might have been  expected.
 My school made only the thinnest pretence of teaching anything  but Latin and Greek.
 When I went there as a very small boy I knew a good  deal of Latin grammar which I had been taught in a few weeks privately  by my uncle.
 When I had been several years at school this same uncle  examined me and discovered that the net result of my schooling was that  I had forgotten what he had taught me, and had learnt nothing else.
 To  this day, though I can still decline a Latin noun and repeat some of the  old paradigms in the old meaningless way, because their rhythm sticks  to me, I have never yet seen a Latin inscription on a tomb that I could  translate throughout.
 Of Greek I can decipher perhaps the greater  part of the Greek alphabet.
 In short, I am, as to classical education,  another Shakespear.
 I can read French as easily as English; and under  pressure of necessity I can turn to account some scraps of German and  a little operatic Italian; but these I was never taught at school.
  Instead, I was taught lying, dishonorable submission to tyranny, dirty  stories, a blasphemous habit of treating love and maternity as  obscene jokes, hopelessness, evasion, derision, cowardice, and all the  blackguard's shifts by which the coward intimidates other cowards.
 And  if I had been a boarder at an English public school instead of a day boy  at an Irish one, I might have had to add to these, deeper shames still.
          Schoolmasters of Genius    And now, if I have reduced the ghosts of my schoolmasters to melancholy  acquiescence in all this (which everybody who has been at an ordinary  school will recognize as true), I have still to meet the much more  sincere protests of the handful of people who have a natural genius for  "bringing up" children.
 I shall be asked with kindly scorn whether I  have heard of Froebel and Pestalozzi, whether I know the work that is  being done by Miss Mason and the Dottoressa Montessori or, best of all  as I think, the Eurythmics School of Jacques Dalcroze at Hellerau near  Dresden.
 Jacques Dalcroze, like Plato, believes in saturating his pupils  with music.
 They walk to music, play to music, work to music, obey drill  commands that would bewilder a guardsman to music, think to music,  live to music, get so clearheaded about music that they can move their  several limbs each in a different metre until they become complicated  living magazines of cross rhythms, and, what is more, make music  for others to do all these things to.
 Stranger still, though Jacques  Dalcroze, like all these great teachers, is the completest of tyrants,  knowing what is right and that he must and will have the lesson just so  or else break his heart (not somebody else's, observe), yet his school  is so fascinating that every woman who sees it exclaims "Oh, why was I  not taught like this!" and elderly gentlemen excitedly enrol themselves  as students and distract classes of infants by their desperate endeavors  to beat two in a bar with one hand and three with the other, and start  off on earnest walks round the room, taking two steps backward whenever  Monsieur Daleroze calls out "Hop!" Oh yes: I know all about these  wonderful schools that you cannot keep children or even adults out of,  and these teachers whom their pupils not only obey without coercion, but  adore.
 And if you will tell me roughly how many Masons and Montessoris  and Dalcrozes you think you can pick up in Europe for salaries of from  thirty shillings to five pounds a week, I will estimate your chances  of converting your millions of little scholastic hells into little  scholastic heavens.
 If you are a distressed gentlewoman starting to make  a living, you can still open a little school; and you can easily buy a  secondhand brass plate inscribed PESTALOZZIAN INSTITUTE and nail it to  your door, though you have no more idea of who Pestalozzi was and what  he advocated or how he did it than the manager of a hotel which began  as a Hydropathic has of the water cure.
 Or you can buy a cheaper plate  inscribed KINDERGARTEN, and imagine, or leave others to imagine, that  Froebel is the governing genius of your little _creche_.
 No doubt the  new brass plates are being inscribed Montessori Institute, and will be  used when the Dotteressa is no longer with us by all the Mrs Pipchins  and Mrs Wilfers throughout this unhappy land.
    I will go further, and admit that the brass plates may not all be  frauds.
 I will tell you that one of my friends was led to genuine  love and considerable knowledge of classical literature by an Irish  schoolmaster whom you would call a hedge schoolmaster (he would not be  allowed to teach anything now) and that it took four years of Harrow  to obliterate that knowledge and change the love into loathing.
 Another  friend of mine who keeps a school in the suburbs, and who deeply  deplores my "prejudice against schoolmasters," has offered to accept my  challenge to tell his pupils that they are as free to get up and go out  of the school at any moment as their parents are to get up and go out  of a theatre where my plays are being performed.
 Even among my own  schoolmasters I can recollect a few whose classes interested me, and  whom I should certainly have pestered for information and instruction  if I could have got into any decent human relationship with them, and  if they had not been compelled by their position to defend themselves as  carefully against such advances as against furtive attempts to hurt them  accidentally in the football field or smash their hats with a clod from  behind a wall.
 But these rare cases actually do more harm than good; for  they encourage us to pretend that all schoolmasters are like that.
  Of what use is it to us that there are always somewhere two or three  teachers of children whose specific genius for their occupation triumphs  over our tyrannous system and even finds in it its opportunity? For that  matter, it is possible, if difficult, to find a solicitor, or even a  judge, who has some notion of what law means, a doctor with a glimmering  of science, an officer who understands duty and discipline, and a  clergyman with an inkling of religion, though there are nothing like  enough of them to go round.
 But even the few who, like Ibsen's Mrs  Solness, have "a genius for nursing the souls of little children" are  like angels forced to work in prisons instead of in heaven; and even  at that they are mostly underpaid and despised.
 That friend of mine who  went from the hedge schoolmaster to Harrow once saw a schoolmaster rush  from an elementary school in pursuit of a boy and strike him.
 My friend,  not considering that the unfortunate man was probably goaded  beyond endurance, smote the schoolmaster and blackened his eye.
 The  schoolmaster appealed to the law; and my friend found himself waiting  nervously in the Hammersmith Police Court to answer for his breach of  the peace.
 In his anxiety he asked a police officer what would happen  to him.
 "What did you do?" said the officer.
 "I gave a man a black eye"  said my friend.
 "Six pounds if he was a gentleman: two pounds if he  wasnt," said the constable.
 "He was a schoolmaster" said my friend.
 "Two  pounds" said the officer; and two pounds it was.
 The blood money was  paid cheerfully; and I have ever since advised elementary schoolmasters  to qualify themselves in the art of self-defence, as the British  Constitution expresses our national estimate of them by allowing us to  blacken three of their eyes for the same price as one of an ordinary  professional man.
 How many Froebels and Pestalozzis and Miss Masons and  Doctoress Montessoris would you be likely to get on these terms even if  they occurred much more frequently in nature than they actually do?    No: I cannot be put off by the news that our system would be perfect if  it were worked by angels.
 I do not admit it even at that, just as I do  not admit that if the sky fell we should all catch larks.
 But I do  not propose to bother about a supply of specific genius which does  not exist, and which, if it did exist, could operate only by at once  recognizing and establishing the rights of children.
          What We Do Not Teach, and Why    To my mind, a glance at the subjects now taught in schools ought to  convince any reasonable person that the object of the lessons is to keep  children out of mischief, and not to qualify them for their part in life  as responsible citizens of a free State.
 It is not possible to maintain  freedom in any State, no matter how perfect its original constitution,  unless its publicly active citizens know a good deal of constitutional  history, law, and political science, with its basis of economics.
 If  as much pains had been taken a century ago to make us all understand  Ricardo's law of rent as to learn our catechisms, the face of the world  would have been changed for the better.
 But for that very reason the  greatest care is taken to keep such beneficially subversive  knowledge from us, with the result that in public life we are either  place-hunters, anarchists, or sheep shepherded by wolves.
    But it will be observed that these are highly controversial subjects.
  Now no controversial subject can be taught dogmatically.
 He who knows  only the official side of a controversy knows less than nothing of its  nature.
 The abler a schoolmaster is, the more dangerous he is to his  pupils unless they have the fullest opportunity of hearing another  equally able person do his utmost to shake his authority and convict him  of error.
    At present such teaching is very unpopular.
 It does not exist in  schools; but every adult who derives his knowledge of public affairs  from the newspapers can take in, at the cost of an extra halfpenny, two  papers of opposite politics.
 Yet the ordinary man so dislikes having his  mind unsettled, as he calls it, that he angrily refuses to allow a paper  which dissents from his views to be brought into his house.
 Even at his  club he resents seeing it, and excludes it if it happens to run counter  to the opinions of all the members.
 The result is that his opinions are  not worth considering.
 A churchman who never reads The Freethinker very  soon has no more real religion than the atheist who never reads The  Church Times.
 The attitude is the same in both cases: they want to hear  nothing good of their enemies; consequently they remain enemies and  suffer from bad blood all their lives; whereas men who know their  opponents and understand their case, quite commonly respect and like  them, and always learn something from them.
    Here, again, as at so many points, we come up against the abuse of  schools to keep people in ignorance and error, so that they may be  incapable of successful revolt against their industrial slavery.
 The  most important simple fundamental economic truth to impress on a  child in complicated civilizations like ours is the truth that whoever  consumes goods or services without producing by personal effort the  equivalent of what he or she consumes, inflicts on the community  precisely the same injury that a thief produces, and would, in any  honest State, be treated as a thief, however full his or her pockets  might be of money made by other people.
 The nation that first teaches  its children that truth, instead of flogging them if they discover  it for themselves, may have to fight all the slaves of all the other  nations to begin with; but it will beat them as easily as an unburdened  man with his hands free and with all his energies in full play can beat  an invalid who has to carry another invalid on his back.
    This, however, is not an evil produced by the denial of children's  rights, nor is it inherent in the nature of schools.
 I mention it only  because it would be folly to call for a reform of our schools without  taking account of the corrupt resistance which awaits the reformer.
    A word must also be said about the opposition to reform of the vested  interest of the classical and coercive schoolmaster.
 He, poor wretch,  has no other means of livelihood; and reform would leave him as a  workman is now left when he is superseded by a machine.
 He had therefore  better do what he can to get the workman compensated, so as to make the  public familiar with the idea of compensation before his own turn comes.
          Taboo in Schools    The suppression of economic knowledge, disastrous as it is, is quite  intelligible, its corrupt motive being as clear as the motive of a  burglar for concealing his jemmy from a policeman.
 But the other great  suppression in our schools, the suppression of the subject of sex, is a  case of taboo.
 In mankind, the lower the type, and the less cultivated  the mind, the less courage there is to face important subjects  objectively.
 The ablest and most highly cultivated people continually  discuss religion, politics, and sex: it is hardly an exaggeration to say  that they discuss nothing else with fully-awakened interest.
 Commoner  and less cultivated people, even when they form societies for  discussion, make a rule that politics and religion are not to be  mentioned, and take it for granted that no decent person would attempt  to discuss sex.
 The three subjects are feared because they rouse the  crude passions which call for furious gratification in murder and rapine  at worst, and, at best, lead to quarrels and undesirable states of  consciousness.
    Even when this excuse of bad manners, ill temper, and brutishness (for  that is what it comes to) compels us to accept it from those adults  among whom political and theological discussion does as a matter of fact  lead to the drawing of knives and pistols, and sex discussion leads to  obscenity, it has no application to children except as an imperative  reason for training them to respect other people's opinions, and to  insist on respect for their own in these as in other important matters  which are equally dangerous: for example, money.
 And in any case  there are decisive reasons; superior, like the reasons for  suspending conventional reticences between doctor and patient, to all  considerations of mere decorum, for giving proper instruction in the  facts of sex.
 Those who object to it (not counting coarse people who  thoughtlessly seize every opportunity of affecting and parading a  fictitious delicacy) are, in effect, advocating ignorance as a safeguard  against precocity.
 If ignorance were practicable there would be  something to be said for it up to the age at which ignorance is a danger  instead of a safeguard.
 Even as it is, it seems undesirable that any  special emphasis should be given to the subject, whether by way of  delicacy and poetry or too impressive warning.
 But the plain fact is  that in refusing to allow the child to be taught by qualified unrelated  elders (the parents shrink from the lesson, even when they are otherwise  qualified, because their own relation to the child makes the subject  impossible between them) we are virtually arranging to have our children  taught by other children in guilty secrets and unclean jests.
 And that  settles the question for all sensible people.
    The dogmatic objection, the sheer instinctive taboo which rules the  subject out altogether as indecent, has no age limit.
 It means that  at no matter what age a woman consents to a proposal of marriage, she  should do so in ignorance of the relation she is undertaking.
 When this  actually happens (and apparently it does happen oftener than would seem  possible) a horrible fraud is being practiced on both the man and the  woman.
 He is led to believe that she knows what she is promising, and  that he is in no danger of finding himself bound to a woman to whom  he is eugenically antipathetic.
 She contemplates nothing but such  affectionate relations as may exist between her and her nearest kinsmen,  and has no knowledge of the condition which, if not foreseen, must come  as an amazing revelation and a dangerous shock, ending possibly in the  discovery that the marriage has been an irreparable mistake.
 Nothing can  justify such a risk.
 There may be people incapable of understanding that  the right to know all there is to know about oneself is a natural human  right that sweeps away all the pretences of others to tamper with one's  consciousness in order to produce what they choose to consider a good  character.
 But they must here bow to the plain mischievousness of  entrapping people into contracts on which the happiness of their whole  lives depends without letting them know what they are undertaking.
          Alleged Novelties in Modern Schools    There is just one more nuisance to be disposed of before I come to  the positive side of my case.
 I mean the person who tells me that  my schooldays belong to a bygone order of educational ideas and  institutions, and that schools are not now a bit like my old school.
  I reply, with Sir Walter Raleigh, by calling on my soul to give this  statement the lie.
 Some years ago I lectured in Oxford on the subject  of Education.
 A friend to whom I mentioned my intention said, "You know  nothing of modern education: schools are not now what they were when  you were a boy.
" I immediately procured the time sheets of half a dozen  modern schools, and found, as I expected, that they might all have been  my old school: there was no real difference.
 I may mention, too, that  I have visited modern schools, and observed that there is a tendency to  hang printed pictures in an untidy and soulless manner on the walls,  and occasionally to display on the mantel-shelf a deplorable glass case  containing certain objects which might possibly, if placed in the hands  of the pupils, give them some practical experience of the weight of  a pound and the length of an inch.
 And sometimes a scoundrel who has  rifled a bird's nest or killed a harmless snake encourages the children  to go and do likewise by putting his victims into an imitation nest and  bottle and exhibiting them as aids to "Nature study.
" A suggestion that  Nature is worth study would certainly have staggered my schoolmasters;  so perhaps I may admit a gleam of progress here.
 But as any child who  attempted to handle these dusty objects would probably be caned, I do  not attach any importance to such modernities in school furniture.
  The school remains what it was in my boyhood, because its real object  remains what it was.
 And that object, I repeat, is to keep the children  out of mischief: mischief meaning for the most part worrying the  grown-ups.
          What is to be Done?    The practical question, then, is what to do with the children.
 Tolerate  them at home we will not.
 Let them run loose in the streets we dare not  until our streets become safe places for children, which, to our utter  shame, they are not at present, though they can hardly be worse than  some homes and some schools.
    The grotesque difficulty of making even a beginning was brought home to  me in the little village in Hertfordshire where I write these lines by  the lady of the manor, who asked me very properly what I was going to do  for the village school.
 I did not know what to reply.
 As the school kept  the children quiet during my working hours, I did not for the sake of  my own personal convenience want to blow it up with dynamite as I should  like to blow up most schools.
 So I asked for guidance.
 "You ought to  give a prize," said the lady.
 I asked if there was a prize for good  conduct.
 As I expected, there was: one for the best-behaved boy and  another for the best-behaved girl.
 On reflection I offered a handsome  prize for the worst-behaved boy and girl on condition that a record  should be kept of their subsequent careers and compared with the records  of the best-behaved, in order to ascertain whether the school criterion  of good conduct was valid out of school.
 My offer was refused because  it would not have had the effect of encouraging the children to give as  little trouble as possible, which is of course the real object of all  conduct prizes in schools.
    I must not pretend, then, that I have a system ready to replace all  the other systems.
 Obstructing the way of the proper organization of  childhood, as of everything else, lies our ridiculous misdistribution  of the national income, with its accompanying class distinctions and  imposition of snobbery on children as a necessary part of their social  training.
 The result of our economic folly is that we are a nation of  undesirable acquaintances; and the first object of all our institutions  for children is segregation.
 If, for example, our children were set free  to roam and play about as they pleased, they would have to be policed;  and the first duty of the police in a State like ours would be to see  that every child wore a badge indicating its class in society, and that  every child seen speaking to another child with a lower-class badge, or  any child wearing a higher badge than that allotted to it by, say, the  College of Heralds, should immediately be skinned alive with a birch  rod.
 It might even be insisted that girls with high-class badges should  be attended by footmen, grooms, or even military escorts.
 In short,  there is hardly any limit to the follies with which our Commercialism  would infect any system that it would tolerate at all.
 But something  like a change of heart is still possible; and since all the evils of  snobbery and segregation are rampant in our schools at present we may as  well make the best as the worst of them.
          Children's Rights and Duties    Now let us ask what are a child's rights, and what are the rights of  society over the child.
 Its rights, being clearly those of any other  human being, are summed up in the right to live: that is, to have all  the conclusive arguments that prove that it would be better dead, that  it is a child of wrath, that the population is already excessive, that  the pains of life are greater than its pleasures, that its sacrifice in  a hospital or laboratory experiment might save millions of lives,  etc.
 etc.
 etc.
, put out of the question, and its existence accepted  as necessary and sacred, all theories to the contrary notwithstanding,  whether by Calvin or Schopenhauer or Pasteur or the nearest person with  a taste for infanticide.
 And this right to live includes, and in fact  is, the right to be what the child likes and can, to do what it likes  and can, to make what it likes and can, to think what it likes and  can, to smash what it dislikes and can, and generally to behave in an  altogether unaccountable manner within the limits imposed by the similar  rights of its neighbors.
 And the rights of society over it clearly  extend to requiring it to qualify itself to live in society without  wasting other peoples time: that is, it must know the rules of the road,  be able to read placards and proclamations, fill voting papers, compose  and send letters and telegrams, purchase food and clothing and  railway tickets for itself, count money and give and take change, and,  generally, know how many beans made five.
 It must know some law, were it  only a simple set of commandments, some political economy, agriculture  enough to shut the gates of fields with cattle in them and not to  trample on growing crops, sanitation enough not to defile its haunts,  and religion enough to have some idea of why it is allowed its rights  and why it must respect the rights of others.
 And the rest of its  education must consist of anything else it can pick up; for beyond this  society cannot go with any certainty, and indeed can only go this far  rather apologetically and provisionally, as doing the best it can on  very uncertain ground.
          Should Children Earn their Living?    Now comes the question how far children should be asked to contribute  to the support of the community.
 In approaching it we must put aside  the considerations that now induce all humane and thoughtful political  students to agitate for the uncompromising abolition of child labor  under our capitalist system.
 It is not the least of the curses of that  system that it will bequeath to future generations a mass of legislation  to prevent capitalists from "using up nine generations of men in one  generation," as they began by doing until they were restrained by law at  the suggestion of Robert Owen, the founder of English Socialism.
 Most of  this legislation will become an insufferable restraint upon freedom  and variety of action when Capitalism goes the way of Druidic human  sacrifice (a much less slaughterous institution).
 There is every reason  why a child should not be allowed to work for commercial profit or for  the support of its parents at the expense of its own future; but there  is no reason whatever why a child should not do some work for its own  sake and that of the community if it can be shewn that both it and the  community will be the better for it.
          Children's Happiness    Also it is important to put the happiness of the children rather  carefully in its place, which is really not a front place.
 The  unsympathetic, selfish, hard people who regard happiness as a very  exceptional indulgence to which children are by no means entitled,  though they may be allowed a very little of it on their birthdays or at  Christmas, are sometimes better parents in effect than those who imagine  that children are as capable of happiness as adults.
 Adults habitually  exaggerate their own capacity in that direction grossly; yet most adults  can stand an allowance of happiness that would be quite thrown away on  children.
 The secret of being miserable is to have leisure to bother  about whether you are happy or not.
 The cure for it is occupation,  because occupation means pre-occupation; and the pre-occupied person  is neither happy nor unhappy, but simply alive and active, which is  pleasanter than any happiness until you are tired of it.
 That is why it  is necessary to happiness that one should be tired.
 Music after dinner  is pleasant: music before breakfast is so unpleasant as to be clearly  unnatural.
 To people who are not overworked holidays are a nuisance.
  To people who are, and who can afford them, they are a troublesome  necessity.
 A perpetual holiday is a good working definition of hell.
          The Horror of the Perpetual Holiday    It will be said here that, on the contrary, heaven is always conceived  as a perpetual holiday, and that whoever is not born to an independent  income is striving for one or longing for one because it gives holidays  for life.
 To which I reply, first, that heaven, as conventionally  conceived, is a place so inane, so dull, so useless, so miserable,  that nobody has ever ventured to describe a whole day in heaven, though  plenty of people have described a day at the seaside; and that the  genuine popular verdict on it is expressed in the proverb "Heaven for  holiness and Hell for company.
" Second, I point out that the wretched  people who have independent incomes and no useful occupation, do the  most amazingly disagreeable and dangerous things to make themselves  tired and hungry in the evening.
 When they are not involved in what they  call sport, they are doing aimlessly what other people have to be paid  to do: driving horses and motor cars; trying on dresses and walking up  and down to shew them off; and acting as footmen and housemaids to royal  personages.
 The sole and obvious cause of the notion that idleness is  delightful and that heaven is a place where there is nothing to be done,  is our school system and our industrial system.
 The school is a prison  in which work is a punishment and a curse.
 In avowed prisons, hard  labor, the only alleviation of a prisoner's lot, is treated as an  aggravation of his punishment; and everything possible is done to  intensify the prisoner's inculcated and unnatural notion that work is an  evil.
 In industry we are overworked and underfed prisoners.
 Under such  absurd circumstances our judgment of things becomes as perverted as our  habits.
 If we were habitually underworked and overfed, our notion  of heaven would be a place where everybody worked strenuously for  twenty-four hours a day and never got anything to eat.
    Once realize that a perpetual holiday is beyond human endurance, and  that "Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do" and it will  be seen that we have no right to impose a perpetual holiday on children.
  If we did, they would soon outdo the Labor Party in their claim for a  Right to Work Bill.
    In any case no child should be brought up to suppose that its food and  clothes come down from heaven or are miraculously conjured from empty  space by papa.
 Loathsome as we have made the idea of duty (like the idea  of work) we must habituate children to a sense of repayable obligation  to the community for what they consume and enjoy, and inculcate the  repayment as a point of honor.
 If we did that today--and nothing but  flat dishonesty prevents us from doing it--we should have no idle rich  and indeed probably no rich, since there is no distinction in being  rich if you have to pay scot and lot in personal effort like the working  folk.
 Therefore, if for only half an hour a day, a child should do  something serviceable to the community.
    Productive work for children has the advantage that its discipline is  the discipline of impersonal necessity, not that of wanton personal  coercion.
 The eagerness of children in our industrial districts to  escape from school to the factory is not caused by lighter tasks or  shorter hours in the factory, nor altogether by the temptation of wages,  nor even by the desire for novelty, but by the dignity of adult work,  the exchange of the factitious personal tyranny of the schoolmaster,  from which the grown-ups are free, for the stern but entirely dignified  Laws of Life to which all flesh is subject.
          University Schoolboyishness    Older children might do a good deal before beginning their collegiate  education.
 What is the matter with our universities is that all the  students are schoolboys, whereas it is of the very essence of university  education that they should be men.
 The function of a university is not  to teach things that can now be taught as well or better by University  Extension lectures or by private tutors or modern correspondence classes  with gramophones.
 We go to them to be socialized; to acquire the hall  mark of communal training; to become citizens of the world instead of  inmates of the enlarged rabbit hutches we call homes; to learn manners  and become unchallengeable ladies and gentlemen.
 The social pressure  which effects these changes should be that of persons who have faced  the full responsibilities of adults as working members of the general  community, not that of a barbarous rabble of half emancipated schoolboys  and unemancipable pedants.
 It is true that in a reasonable state of  society this outside experience would do for us very completely what the  university does now so corruptly that we tolerate its bad manners only  because they are better than no manners at all.
 But the university will  always exist in some form as a community of persons desirous of pushing  their culture to the highest pitch they are capable of, not as solitary  students reading in seclusion, but as members of a body of individuals  all pursuing culture, talking culture, thinking culture, above all,  criticizing culture.
 If such persons are to read and talk and criticize  to any purpose, they must know the world outside the university at least  as well as the shopkeeper in the High Street does.
 And this is just  what they do not know at present.
 You may say of them, paraphrasing  Mr. Kipling, "What do they know of Plato that only Plato know?" If our  universities would exclude everybody who had not earned a living by his  or her own exertions for at least a couple of years, their effect would  be vastly improved.
          The New Laziness    The child of the future, then, if there is to be any future but one of  decay, will work more or less for its living from an early age; and  in doing so it will not shock anyone, provided there be no longer any  reason to associate the conception of children working for their living  with infants toiling in a factory for ten hours a day or boys drudging  from nine to six under gas lamps in underground city offices.
 Lads and  lasses in their teens will probably be able to produce as much as the  most expensive person now costs in his own person (it is retinue that  eats up the big income) without working too hard or too long for quite  as much happiness as they can enjoy.
 The question to be balanced then  will be, not how soon people should be put to work, but how soon they  should be released from any obligation of the kind.
 A life's work is  like a day's work: it can begin early and leave off early or begin late  and leave off late, or, as with us, begin too early and never leave off  at all, obviously the worst of all possible plans.
 In any event we  must finally reckon work, not as the curse our schools and prisons and  capitalist profit factories make it seem today, but as a prime necessity  of a tolerable existence.
 And if we cannot devise fresh wants as fast  as we develop the means of supplying them, there will come a scarcity  of the needed, cut-and-dried, appointed work that is always ready to  everybody's hand.
 It may have to be shared out among people all of whom  want more of it.
 And then a new sort of laziness will become the bugbear  of society: the laziness that refuses to face the mental toil and  adventure of making work by inventing new ideas or extending the domain  of knowledge, and insists on a ready-made routine.
 It may come to  forcing people to retire before they are willing to make way for younger  ones: that is, to driving all persons of a certain age out of industry,  leaving them to find something experimental to occupy them on pain of  perpetual holiday.
 Men will then try to spend twenty thousand a year  for the sake of having to earn it.
 Instead of being what we are now, the  cheapest and nastiest of the animals, we shall be the costliest, most  fastidious, and best bred.
 In short, there is no end to the astonishing  things that may happen when the curse of Adam becomes first a blessing  and then an incurable habit.
 And in that day we must not grudge children  their share of it.
          The Infinite School Task    The question of children's work, however, is only a question of what the  child ought to do for the community.
 How highly it should qualify itself  is another matter.
 But most of the difficulty of inducing children  to learn would disappear if our demands became not only definite but  finite.
 When learning is only an excuse for imprisonment, it is an  instrument of torture which becomes more painful the more progress is  made.
 Thus when you have forced a child to learn the Church Catechism,  a document profound beyond the comprehension of most adults, you are  sometimes at a standstill for something else to teach; and you therefore  keep the wretched child repeating its catechism again and again until  you hit on the plan of making it learn instalments of Bible verses,  preferably from the book of Numbers.
 But as it is less trouble to set a  lesson that you know yourself, there is a tendency to keep repeating the  already learnt lesson rather than break new ground.
 At school I began  with a fairly complete knowledge of Latin grammar in the childish sense  of being able to repeat all the paradigms; and I was kept at this, or  rather kept in a class where the master never asked me to do it because  he knew I could, and therefore devoted himself to trapping the boys who  could not, until I finally forgot most of it.
 But when progress took  place, what did it mean? First it meant Caesar, with the foreknowledge  that to master Caesar meant only being set at Virgil, with the  culminating horror of Greek and Homer in reserve at the end of that.
 I  preferred Caesar, because his statement that Gaul is divided into three  parts, though neither interesting nor true, was the only Latin sentence  I could translate at sight: therefore the longer we stuck at Caesar the  better I was pleased.
 Just so do less classically educated children see  nothing in the mastery of addition but the beginning of subtraction, and  so on through multiplication and division and fractions, with the black  cloud of algebra on the horizon.
 And if a boy rushes through all that,  there is always the calculus to fall back on, unless indeed you insist  on his learning music, and proceed to hit him if he cannot tell you the  year Beethoven was born.
    A child has a right to finality as regards its compulsory lessons.
  Also as regards physical training.
 At present it is assumed that the  schoolmaster has a right to force every child into an attempt to become  Porson and Bentley, Leibnitz and Newton, all rolled into one.
 This is  the tradition of the oldest grammar schools.
 In our times an even more  horrible and cynical claim has been made for the right to drive boys  through compulsory games in the playing fields until they are too much  exhausted physically to do anything but drop off to sleep.
 This is  supposed to protect them from vice; but as it also protects them from  poetry, literature, music, meditation and prayer, it may be dismissed  with the obvious remark that if boarding schools are places whose  keepers are driven to such monstrous measures lest more abominable  things should happen, then the sooner boarding schools are violently  abolished the better.
 It is true that society may make physical claims  on the child as well as mental ones: the child must learn to walk, to  use a knife and fork, to swim, to ride a bicycle, to acquire sufficient  power of self-defence to make an attack on it an arduous and uncertain  enterprise, perhaps to fly.
 What as a matter of common-sense it clearly  has not a right to do is to make this an excuse for keeping the child  slaving for ten hours at physical exercises on the ground that it is not  yet as dexterous as Cinquevalli and as strong as Sandow.
          The Rewards and Risks of Knowledge    In a word, we have no right to insist on educating a child; for its  education can end only with its life and will not even then be complete.
  Compulsory completion of education is the last folly of a rotten  and desperate civilization.
 It is the rattle in its throat before  dissolution.
 All we can fairly do is to prescribe certain definite  acquirements and accomplishments as qualifications for certain  employments; and to secure them, not by the ridiculous method of  inflicting injuries on the persons who have not yet mastered them, but  by attaching certain privileges (not pecuniary) to the employments.
    Most acquirements carry their own privileges with them.
 Thus a baby has  to be pretty closely guarded and imprisoned because it cannot take  care of itself.
 It has even to be carried about (the most complete  conceivable infringement of its liberty) until it can walk.
 But nobody  goes on carrying children after they can walk lest they should walk into  mischief, though Arab boys make their sisters carry them, as our own  spoiled children sometimes make their nurses, out of mere laziness,  because sisters in the East and nurses in the West are kept in  servitude.
 But in a society of equals (the only reasonable and  permanently possible sort of society) children are in much greater  danger of acquiring bandy legs through being left to walk before they  are strong enough than of being carried when they are well able to walk.
  Anyhow, freedom of movement in a nursery is the reward of learning to  walk; and in precisely the same way freedom of movement in a city is  the reward of learning how to read public notices, and to count and use  money.
 The consequences are of course much larger than the mere ability  to read the name of a street or the number of a railway platform and the  destination of a train.
 When you enable a child to read these, you also  enable it to read this preface, to the utter destruction, you may quite  possibly think, of its morals and docility.
 You also expose it to the  danger of being run over by taxicabs and trains.
 The moral and physical  risks of education are enormous: every new power a child acquires,  from speaking, walking, and co-ordinating its vision, to conquering  continents and founding religions, opens up immense new possibilities of  mischief.
 Teach a child to write and you teach it how to forge: teach it  to speak and you teach it how to lie: teach it to walk and you teach it  how to kick its mother to death.
    The great problem of slavery for those whose aim is to maintain it  is the problem of reconciling the efficiency of the slave with  the helplessness that keeps him in servitude; and this problem is  fortunately not completely soluble; for it is not in fact found possible  for a duke to treat his solicitor or his doctor as he treats his  laborers, though they are all equally his slaves: the laborer being in  fact less dependent on his favor than the professional man.
 Hence it is  that men come to resent, of all things, protection, because it so often  means restriction of their liberty lest they should make a bad use  of it.
 If there are dangerous precipices about, it is much easier  and cheaper to forbid people to walk near the edge than to put up an  effective fence: that is why both legislators and parents and the paid  deputies of parents are always inhibiting and prohibiting and punishing  and scolding and laming and cramping and delaying progress and growth  instead of making the dangerous places as safe as possible and then  boldly taking and allowing others to take the irreducible minimum of  risk.
          English Physical Hardihood and Spiritual Cowardice    It is easier to convert most people to the need for allowing their  children to run physical risks than moral ones.
 I can remember a  relative of mine who, when I was a small child, unused to horses and  very much afraid of them, insisted on putting me on a rather rumbustious  pony with little spurs on my heels (knowing that in my agitation I would  use them unconsciously), and being enormously amused at my terrors.
 Yet  when that same lady discovered that I had found a copy of The Arabian  Nights and was devouring it with avidity, she was horrified, and hid it  away from me lest it should break my soul as the pony might have broken  my neck.
 This way of producing hardy bodies and timid souls is so common  in country houses that you may spend hours in them listening to stories  of broken collar bones, broken backs, and broken necks without coming  upon a single spiritual adventure or daring thought.
    But whether the risks to which liberty exposes us are moral or physical  our right to liberty involves the right to run them.
 A man who is not  free to risk his neck as an aviator or his soul as a heretic is not free  at all; and the right to liberty begins, not at the age of 21 years but  of 21 seconds.
          The Risks of Ignorance and Weakness    The difficulty with children is that they need protection from risks  they are too young to understand, and attacks they can neither avoid  nor resist.
 You may on academic grounds allow a child to snatch glowing  coals from the fire once.
 You will not do it twice.
 The risks of  liberty we must let everyone take; but the risks of ignorance and  self-helplessness are another matter.
 Not only children but adults  need protection from them.
 At present adults are often exposed to risks  outside their knowledge or beyond their comprehension or powers of  resistance or foresight: for example, we have to look on every day  at marriages or financial speculations that may involve far worse  consequences than burnt fingers.
 And just as it is part of the business  of adults to protect children, to feed them, clothe them, shelter them,  and shift for them in all sorts of ways until they are able to shift for  themselves, it is coming more and more to be seen that this is true not  only of the relation between adults and children, but between adults and  adults.
 We shall not always look on indifferently at foolish marriages  and financial speculations, nor allow dead men to control live  communities by ridiculous wills and living heirs to squander and ruin  great estates, nor tolerate a hundred other absurd liberties that  we allow today because we are too lazy to find out the proper way to  interfere.
 But the interference must be regulated by some theory of the  individual's rights.
 Though the right to live is absolute, it is not  unconditional.
 If a man is unbearably mischievous, he must be killed.
  This is a mere matter of necessity, like the killing of a man-eating  tiger in a nursery, a venomous snake in the garden, or a fox in the  poultry yard.
 No society could be constructed on the assumption that  such extermination is a violation of the creature's right to live, and  therefore must not be allowed.
 And then at once arises the danger into  which morality has led us: the danger of persecution.
 One Christian  spreading his doctrines may seem more mischievous than a dozen thieves:  throw him therefore to the lions.
 A lying or disobedient child may  corrupt a whole generation and make human Society impossible: therefore  thrash the vice out of him.
 And so on until our whole system of  abortion, intimidation, tyranny, cruelty and the rest is in full swing  again.
          The Common Sense of Toleration    The real safeguard against this is the dogma of Toleration.
 I need not  here repeat the compact treatise on it which I prepared for the Joint  Committee on the Censorship of Stage Plays, and prefixed to The Shewing  Up of Blanco Posnet.
 It must suffice now to say that the present must  not attempt to schoolmaster the future by pretending to know good from  evil in tendency, or protect citizens against shocks to their opinions  and convictions, moral, political or religious: in other words it must  not persecute doctrines of any kind, or what is called bad taste,  and must insist on all persons facing such shocks as they face frosty  weather or any of the other disagreeable, dangerous, or bracing  incidents of freedom.
 The expediency of Toleration has been forced on us  by the fact that progressive enlightenment depends on a fair hearing for  doctrines which at first appear seditious, blasphemous, and immoral, and  which deeply shock people who never think originally, thought being with  them merely a habit and an echo.
 The deeper ground for Toleration is  the nature of creation, which, as we now know, proceeds by evolution.
  Evolution finds its way by experiment; and this finding of the way  varies according to the stage of development reached, from the blindest  groping along the line of least resistance to intellectual speculation,  with its practical sequel of hypothesis and experimental verification;  or to observation, induction, and deduction; or even into so rapid and  intuitive an integration of all these processes in a single brain  that we get the inspired guess of the man of genius and the desperate  resolution of the teacher of new truths who is first slain as a  blasphemous apostate and then worshipped as a prophet.
    Here the law for the child is the same as for the adult.
 The high priest  must not rend his garments and cry "Crucify him" when he is shocked:  the atheist must not clamor for the suppression of Law's Serious Call  because it has for two centuries destroyed the natural happiness of  innumerable unfortunate children by persuading their parents that it is  their religious duty to be miserable.
 It, and the Sermon on the Mount,  and Machiavelli's Prince, and La Rochefoucauld's maxims, and Hymns  Ancient and Modern, and De Glanville's apologue, and Dr.
 Watts's rhymes,  and Nietzsche's Gay Science, and Ingersoll's Mistakes of Moses, and the  speeches and pamphlets of the people who want us to make war on  Germany, and the Noodle's Orations and articles of our politicians and  journalists, must all be tolerated not only because any of them may for  all we know be on the right track but because it is in the conflict of  opinion that we win knowledge and wisdom.
 However terrible the wounds  suffered in that conflict, they are better than the barren peace of  death that follows when all the combatants are slaughtered or bound hand  and foot.
    The difficulty at present is that though this necessity for Toleration  is a law of political science as well established as the law of  gravitation, our rulers are never taught political science: on the  contrary, they are taught in school that the master tolerates nothing  that is disagreeable to him; that ruling is simply being master; and  that the master's method is the method of violent punishment.
 And our  citizens, all school taught, are walking in the same darkness.
 As I  write these lines the Home Secretary is explaining that a man who has  been imprisoned for blasphemy must not be released because his remarks  were painful to the feelings of his pious fellow townsmen.
 Now it  happens that this very Home Secretary has driven many thousands of his  fellow citizens almost beside themselves by the crudity of his notions  of government, and his simple inability to understand why he should  not use and make laws to torment and subdue people who do not happen  to agree with him.
 In a word, he is not a politician, but a grown-up  schoolboy who has at last got a cane in his hand.
 And as all the rest of  us are in the same condition (except as to command of the cane) the only  objection made to his proceedings takes the shape of clamorous demands  that _he_ should be caned instead of being allowed to cane other people.
          The Sin of Athanasius    It seems hopeless.
 Anarchists are tempted to preach a violent and  implacable resistance to all law as the only remedy; and the result of  that speedily is that people welcome any tyranny that will rescue them  from chaos.
 But there is really no need to choose between anarchy and  tyranny.
 A quite reasonable state of things is practicable if we proceed  on human assumptions and not on academic ones.
 If adults will frankly  give up their claim to know better than children what the purposes  of the Life Force are, and treat the child as an experiment like  themselves, and possibly a more successful one, and at the same time  relinquish their monstrous parental claims to personal private property  in children, the rest must be left to common sense.
 It is our attitude,  our religion, that is wrong.
 A good beginning might be made by enacting  that any person dictating a piece of conduct to a child or to anyone  else as the will of God, or as absolutely right, should be dealt with  as a blasphemer: as, indeed, guilty of the unpardonable sin against the  Holy Ghost.
 If the penalty were death, it would rid us at once of that  scourge of humanity, the amateur Pope.
 As an Irish Protestant, I raise  the cry of No Popery with hereditary zest.
 We are overrun with Popes.
  From curates and governesses, who may claim a sort of professional  standing, to parents and uncles and nurserymaids and school teachers  and wiseacres generally, there are scores of thousands of human insects  groping through our darkness by the feeble phosphorescence of their own  tails, yet ready at a moment's notice to reveal the will of God on every  possible subject; to explain how and why the universe was made (in my  youth they added the exact date) and the circumstances under which  it will cease to exist; to lay down precise rules of right and wrong  conduct; to discriminate infallibly between virtuous and vicious  character; and all this with such certainty that they are prepared to  visit all the rigors of the law, and all the ruinous penalties of social  ostracism on people, however harmless their actions maybe who venture  to laugh at their monstrous conceit or to pay their assumptions the  extravagant compliment of criticizing them.
 As to children, who shall  say what canings and birchings and terrifyings and threats of hell fire  and impositions and humiliations and petty imprisonings and sendings  to bed and standing in corners and the like they have suffered because  their parents and guardians and teachers knew everything so much better  than Socrates or Solon?    It is this ignorant uppishness that does the mischief.
 A stranger on the  planet might expect that its grotesque absurdity would provoke enough  ridicule to cure it; but unfortunately quite the contrary happens.
  Just as our ill health delivers us into the hands of medical quacks and  creates a passionate demand for impudent pretences that doctors can  cure the diseases they themselves die of daily, so our ignorance and  helplessness set us clamoring for spiritual and moral quacks who pretend  that they can save our souls from their own damnation.
 If a doctor were  to say to his patients, "I am familiar with your symptoms, because I  have seen other people in your condition; and I will bring the very  little knowledge we have to your treatment; but except in that very  shallow sense I dont know what is the matter with you; and I cant  undertake to cure you," he would be a lost man professionally; and if a  clergyman, on being called on to award a prize for good conduct in  the village school, were to say, "I am afraid I cannot say who is the  best-behaved child, because I really do not know what good conduct is;  but I will gladly take the teacher's word as to which child has  caused least inconvenience," he would probably be unfrocked, if not  excommunicated.
 And yet no honest and intellectually capable doctor or  parson can say more.
 Clearly it would not be wise of the doctor to say  it, because optimistic lies have such immense therapeutic value that a  doctor who cannot tell them convincingly has mistaken his profession.
  And a clergyman who is not prepared to lay down the law dogmatically  will not be of much use in a village school, though it behoves him all  the more to be very careful what law he lays down.
 But unless both the  clergyman and the doctor are in the attitude expressed by these speeches  they are not fit for their work.
 The man who believes that he has more  than a provisional hypothesis to go upon is a born fool.
 He may have  to act vigorously on it.
 The world has no use for the Agnostic who wont  believe anything because anything might be false, and wont deny anything  because anything might be true.
 But there is a wide difference between  saying, "I believe this; and I am going to act on it," or, "I dont  believe it; and I wont act on it," and saying, "It is true; and it is  my duty and yours to act on it," or, "It is false; and it is my duty  and yours to refuse to act on it.
" The difference is as great as that  between the Apostles' Creed and the Athanasian Creed.
 When you repeat  the Apostles' Creed you affirm that you believe certain things.
 There  you are clearly within your rights.
 When you repeat the Athanasian  Creed, you affirm that certain things are so, and that anybody who  doubts that they are so cannot be saved.
 And this is simply a piece of  impudence on your part, as you know nothing about it except that as good  men as you have never heard of your creed.
 The apostolic attitude is  a desire to convert others to our beliefs for the sake of sympathy and  light: the Athanasian attitude is a desire to murder people who dont  agree with us.
 I am sufficient of an Athanasian to advocate a law  for the speedy execution of all Athanasians, because they violate the  fundamental proposition of my creed, which is, I repeat, that all  living creatures are experiments.
 The precise formula for the Superman,  _ci-devant_ The Just Man Made Perfect, has not yet been discovered.
  Until it is, every birth is an experiment in the Great Research which is  being conducted by the Life Force to discover that formula.
          The Experiment Experimenting    And now all the modern schoolmaster abortionists will rise up beaming,  and say, "We quite agree.
 We regard every child in our school as a  subject for experiment.
 We are always experimenting with them.
 We  challenge the experimental test for our system.
 We are continually  guided by our experience in our great work of moulding the character of  our future citizens, etc.
 etc.
 etc.
" I am sorry to seem irreconcilable;  but it is the Life Force that has to make the experiment and not the  schoolmaster; and the Life Force for the child's purpose is in the child  and not in the schoolmaster.
 The schoolmaster is another experiment;  and a laboratory in which all the experiments began experimenting on one  another would not produce intelligible results.
 I admit, however, that  if my schoolmasters had treated me as an experiment of the Life Force:  that is, if they had set me free to do as I liked subject only to my  political rights and theirs, they could not have watched the experiment  very long, because the first result would have been a rapid movement  on my part in the direction of the door, and my disappearance  there-through.
    It may be worth inquiring where I should have gone to.
 I should say that  practically every time I should have gone to a much more educational  place.
 I should have gone into the country, or into the sea, or into the  National Gallery, or to hear a band if there was one, or to any library  where there were no schoolbooks.
 I should have read very dry and  difficult books: for example, though nothing would have induced me  to read the budget of stupid party lies that served as a text-book of  history in school, I remember reading Robertson's Charles V.
 and his  history of Scotland from end to end most laboriously.
 Once, stung by the  airs of a schoolfellow who alleged that he had read Locke On The Human  Understanding, I attempted to read the Bible straight through, and  actually got to the Pauline Epistles before I broke down in disgust at  what seemed to me their inveterate crookedness of mind.
 If there had  been a school where children were really free, I should have had to  be driven out of it for the sake of my health by the teachers; for the  children to whom a literary education can be of any use are insatiable:  they will read and study far more than is good for them.
 In fact the  real difficulty is to prevent them from wasting their time by reading  for the sake of reading and studying for the sake of studying, instead  of taking some trouble to find out what they really like and are capable  of doing some good at.
 Some silly person will probably interrupt me  here with the remark that many children have no appetite for a literary  education at all, and would never open a book if they were not forced  to.
 I have known many such persons who have been forced to the point  of obtaining University degrees.
 And for all the effect their literary  exercises has left on them they might just as well have been put on the  treadmill.
 In fact they are actually less literate than the treadmill  would have left them; for they might by chance have picked up and dipped  into a volume of Shakespear or a translation of Homer if they had not  been driven to loathe every famous name in literature.
 I should probably  know as much Latin as French, if Latin had not been made the excuse for  my school imprisonment and degradation.
          Why We Loathe Learning and Love Sport    If we are to discuss the importance of art, learning, and intellectual  culture, the first thing we have to recognize is that we have very  little of them at present; and that this little has not been produced by  compulsory education: nay, that the scarcity is unnatural and has been  produced by the violent exclusion of art and artists from schools.
 On  the other hand we have quite a considerable degree of bodily culture:  indeed there is a continual outcry against the sacrifice of mental  accomplishments to athletics.
 In other words a sacrifice of the  professed object of compulsory education to the real object of voluntary  education.
 It is assumed that this means that people prefer bodily  to mental culture; but may it not mean that they prefer liberty and  satisfaction to coercion and privation.
 Why is it that people who have  been taught Shakespear as a school subject loathe his plays and cannot  by any means be persuaded ever to open his works after they escape from  school, whereas there is still, 300 years after his death, a wide and  steady sale for his works to people who read his plays as plays, and not  as task work? If Shakespear, or for that matter, Newton and Leibnitz,  are allowed to find their readers and students they will find them.
  If their works are annotated and paraphrased by dullards, and the  annotations and paraphrases forced on all young people by imprisonment  and flogging and scolding, there will not be a single man of letters or  higher mathematician the more in the country: on the contrary there will  be less, as so many potential lovers of literature and mathematics will  have been incurably prejudiced against them.
 Everyone who is conversant  with the class in which child imprisonment and compulsory schooling is  carried out to the final extremity of the university degree knows that  its scholastic culture is a sham; that it knows little about literature  or art and a great deal about point-to-point races; and that the  village cobbler, who has never read a page of Plato, and is admittedly  a dangerously ignorant man politically, is nevertheless a Socrates  compared to the classically educated gentlemen who discuss politics in  country houses at election time (and at no other time) after their day's  earnest and skilful shooting.
 Think of the years and years of weary  torment the women of the piano-possessing class have been forced to  spend over the keyboard, fingering scales.
 How many of them could be  bribed to attend a pianoforte recital by a great player, though they  will rise from sick beds rather than miss Ascot or Goodwood?    Another familiar fact that teaches the same lesson is that many women  who have voluntarily attained a high degree of culture cannot add  up their own housekeeping books, though their education in simple  arithmetic was compulsory, whereas their higher education has been  wholly voluntary.
 Everywhere we find the same result.
 The imprisonment,  the beating, the taming and laming, the breaking of young spirits, the  arrest of development, the atrophy of all inhibitive power except the  power of fear, are real: the education is sham.
 Those who have been  taught most know least.
          Antichrist    Among the worst effects of the unnatural segregation of children in  schools and the equally unnatural constant association of them with  adults in the family is the utter defeat of the vital element in  Christianity.
 Christ stands in the world for that intuition of the  highest humanity that we, being members one of another, must not  complain, must not scold, must not strike, nor revile nor persecute nor  revenge nor punish.
 Now family life and school life are, as far as the  moral training of children is concerned, nothing but the deliberate  inculcation of a routine of complaint, scolding, punishment,  persecution, and revenge as the natural and only possible way of dealing  with evil or inconvenience.
 "Aint nobody to be whopped for this here?"  exclaimed Sam Weller when he saw his employer's name written up on a  stage coach, and conceived the phenomenon as an insult which reflected  on himself.
 This exclamation of Sam Weller is at once the negation of  Christianity and the beginning and the end of current morality; and so  it will remain as long as the family and the school persist as we know  them: that is, as long as the rights of children are so utterly denied  that nobody will even take the trouble to ascertain what they are, and  coming of age is like the turning of a convict into the street after  twenty-one years penal servitude.
 Indeed it is worse; for the convict  may have learnt before his conviction how to live in freedom and may  remember how to set about it, however lamed his powers of freedom may  have become through disuse; but the child knows no other way of life but  the slave's way.
 Born free, as Rousseau says, he has been laid hands on  by slaves from the moment of his birth and brought up as a slave.
 How is  he, when he is at last set free, to be anything else than the slave he  actually is, clamoring for war, for the lash, for police, prisons, and  scaffolds in a wild panic of delusion that without these things he  is lost.
 The grown-up Englishman is to the end of his days a badly  brought-up child, beyond belief quarrelsome, petulant, selfish,  destructive, and cowardly: afraid that the Germans will come and enslave  him; that the burglar will come and rob him; that the bicycle or motor  car will run over him; that the smallpox will attack him; and that the  devil will run away with him and empty him out like a sack of coals on a  blazing fire unless his nurse or his parents or his schoolmaster or  his bishop or his judge or his army or his navy will do something to  frighten these bad things away.
 And this Englishman, without the moral  courage of a louse, will risk his neck for fun fifty times every winter  in the hunting field, and at Badajos sieges and the like will ram his  head into a hole bristling with sword blades rather than be beaten in  the one department in which he has been brought up to consult his own  honor.
 As a Sportsman (and war is fundamentally the sport of hunting  and fighting the most dangerous of the beasts of prey) he feels free.
 He  will tell you himself that the true sportsman is never a snob, a coward,  a duffer, a cheat, a thief, or a liar.
 Curious, is it not, that he has  not the same confidence in other sorts of man?    And even sport is losing its freedom.
 Soon everybody will be schooled,  mentally and physically, from the cradle to the end of the term of adult  compulsory military service, and finally of compulsory civil service  lasting until the age of superannuation.
 Always more schooling, more  compulsion.
 We are to be cured by an excess of the dose that has  poisoned us.
 Satan is to cast out Satan.
          Under the Whip    Clearly this will not do.
 We must reconcile education with liberty.
  We must find out some means of making men workers and, if need be,  warriors, without making them slaves.
 We must cultivate the noble  virtues that have their root in pride.
 Now no schoolmaster will teach  these any more than a prison governor will teach his prisoners how to  mutiny and escape.
 Self-preservation forces him to break the spirit  that revolts against him, and to inculcate submission, even to obscene  assault, as a duty.
 A bishop once had the hardihood to say that he would  rather see England free than England sober.
 Nobody has yet dared to say  that he would rather see an England of ignoramuses than an England of  cowards and slaves.
 And if anyone did, it would be necessary to point  out that the antithesis is not a practical one, as we have got at  present an England of ignoramuses who are also cowards and slaves, and  extremely proud of it at that, because in school they are taught to  submit, with what they ridiculously call Oriental fatalism (as if any  Oriental has ever submitted more helplessly and sheepishly to robbery  and oppression than we Occidentals do), to be driven day after day into  compounds and set to the tasks they loathe by the men they hate and  fear, as if this were the inevitable destiny of mankind.
 And naturally,  when they grow up, they helplessly exchange the prison of the school for  the prison of the mine or the workshop or the office, and drudge along  stupidly and miserably, with just enough gregarious instinct to turn  furiously on any intelligent person who proposes a change.
 It would be  quite easy to make England a paradise, according to our present ideas,  in a few years.
 There is no mystery about it: the way has been pointed  out over and over again.
 The difficulty is not the way but the will.
 And  we have no will because the first thing done with us in childhood was to  break our will.
 Can anything be more disgusting than the spectacle of a  nation reading the biography of Gladstone and gloating over the account  of how he was flogged at Eton, two of his schoolfellows being compelled  to hold him down whilst he was flogged.
 Not long ago a public body in  England had to deal with the case of a schoolmaster who, conceiving  himself insulted by the smoking of a cigaret against his orders by  a pupil eighteen years old, proposed to flog him publicly as a  satisfaction to what he called his honor and authority.
 I had intended  to give the particulars of this ease, but find the drudgery of repeating  such stuff too sickening, and the effect unjust to a man who was  doing only what others all over the country were doing as part of the  established routine of what is called education.
 The astounding part of  it was the manner in which the person to whom this outrage on decency  seemed quite proper and natural claimed to be a functionary of high  character, and had his claim allowed.
 In Japan he would hardly have been  allowed the privilege of committing suicide.
 What is to be said of a  profession in which such obscenities are made points of honor, or of  institutions in which they are an accepted part of the daily routine?  Wholesome people would not argue about the taste of such nastinesses:  they would spit them out; but we are tainted with flagellomania from  our childhood.
 When will we realize that the fact that we can become  accustomed to anything, however disgusting at first, makes it necessary  for us to examine carefully everything we have become accustomed to?  Before motor cars became common, necessity had accustomed us to a  foulness in our streets which would have horrified us had the street  been our drawing-room carpet.
 Before long we shall be as particular  about our streets as we now are about our carpets; and their condition  in the nineteenth century will become as forgotten and incredible as the  condition of the corridors of palaces and the courts of castles was as  late as the eighteenth century.
 This foulness, we can plead, was imposed  on us as a necessity by the use of horses and of huge retinues; but  flogging has never been so imposed: it has always been a vice, craved  for on any pretext by those depraved by it.
 Boys were flogged when  criminals were hanged, to impress the awful warning on them.
 Boys were  flogged at boundaries, to impress the boundaries on their memory.
 Other  methods and other punishments were always available: the choice of  this one betrayed the sensual impulse which makes the practice an  abomination.
 But when its viciousness made it customary, it was  practised and tolerated on all hands by people who were innocent of  anything worse than stupidity, ill temper, and inability to discover  other methods of maintaining order than those they had always seen  practised and approved of.
 From children and animals it extended to  slaves and criminals.
 In the days of Moses it was limited to 39 lashes.
  In the early nineteenth century it had become an open madness: soldiers  were sentenced to a thousand lashes for trifling offences, with the  result (among others less mentionable) that the Iron Duke of Wellington  complained that it was impossible to get an order obeyed in the British  army except in two or three crack regiments.
 Such frantic excesses of  this disgusting neurosis provoked a reaction against it; but the clamor  for it by depraved persons never ceased, and was tolerated by a nation  trained to it from childhood in the schools until last year (1913), when  in what must be described as a paroxysm of sexual excitement provoked by  the agitation concerning the White Slave Traffic (the purely commercial  nature of which I was prevented from exposing on the stage by the  Censorship twenty years ago) the Government yielded to an outcry for  flagellation led by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and passed an Act  under which a judge can sentence a man to be flogged to the utmost  extremity with any instrument usable for such a purpose that he cares  to prescribe.
 Such an Act is not a legislative phenomenon but a  psychopathic one.
 Its effect on the White Slave Traffic was, of course,  to distract public attention from its real cause and from the people who  really profit by it to imaginary "foreign scoundrels," and to secure a  monopoly of its organization for women.
    And all this evil is made possible by the schoolmaster with his cane and  birch, by the parents getting rid as best they can of the nuisance of  children making noise and mischief in the house, and by the denial to  children of the elementary rights of human beings.
    The first man who enslaved and "broke in" an animal with a whip would  have invented the explosion engine instead could he have foreseen the  curse he was laying on his race.
 For men and women learnt thereby to  enslave and break in their children by the same means.
 These children,  grown up, knew no other methods of training.
 Finally the evil that was  done for gain by the greedy was refined on and done for pleasure by the  lustful.
 Flogging has become a pleasure purchasable in our streets, and  inhibition a grown-up habit that children play at.
 "Go and see what baby  is doing; and tell him he mustnt" is the last word of the nursery; and  the grimmest aspect of it is that it was first formulated by a comic  paper as a capital joke.
          Technical Instruction    Technical instruction tempts to violence (as a short cut) more  than liberal education.
 The sailor in Mr Rudyard Kipling's Captains  Courageous, teaching the boy the names of the ship's tackle with a  rope's end, does not disgust us as our schoolmasters do, especially as  the boy was a spoiled boy.
 But an unspoiled boy would not have needed  that drastic medicine.
 Technical training may be as tedious as learning  to skate or to play the piano or violin; but it is the price one must  pay to achieve certain desirable results or necessary ends.
 It is a  monstrous thing to force a child to learn Latin or Greek or mathematics  on the ground that they are an indispensable gymnastic for the mental  powers.
 It would be monstrous even if it were true; for there is no  labor that might not be imposed on a child or an adult on the same  pretext; but as a glance at the average products of our public school  and university education shews that it is not true, it need not trouble  us.
 But it is a fact that ignorance of Latin and Greek and mathematics  closes certain careers to men (I do not mean artificial, unnecessary,  noxious careers like those of the commercial schoolmaster).
 Languages,  even dead ones, have their uses; and, as it seems to many of us,  mathematics have their uses.
 They will always be learned by people who  want to learn them; and people will always want to learn them as long as  they are of any importance in life: indeed the want will survive their  importance: superstition is nowhere stronger than in the field of  obsolete acquirements.
 And they will never be learnt fruitfully by  people who do not want to learn them either for their own sake or for  use in necessary work.
 There is no harder schoolmaster than experience;  and yet experience fails to teach where there is no desire to learn.
    Still, one must not begin to apply this generalization too early.
  And this brings me to an important factor in the case: the factor of  evolution.
          Docility and Dependence    If anyone, impressed by my view that the rights of a child are precisely  those of an adult, proceeds to treat a child as if it were an adult, he  (or she) will find that though the plan will work much better at some  points than the usual plan, at others it will not work at all; and this  discovery may provoke him to turn back from the whole conception of  children's rights with a jest at the expense of bachelors' and old  maids' children.
 In dealing with children what is needed is not logic  but sense.
 There is no logical reason why young persons should be  allowed greater control of their property the day after they are  twenty-one than the day before it.
 There is no logical reason why I,  who strongly object to an adult standing over a boy of ten with a Latin  grammar, and saying, "you must learn this, whether you want to or not,"  should nevertheless be quite prepared to stand over a boy of five with  the multiplication table or a copy book or a code of elementary good  manners, and practice on his docility to make him learn them.
 And there  is no logical reason why I should do for a child a great many little  offices, some of them troublesome and disagreeable, which I should  not do for a boy twice its age, or support a boy or girl when I would  unhesitatingly throw an adult on his own resources.
 But there are  practical reasons, and sensible reasons, and affectionate reasons for  all these illogicalities.
 Children do not want to be treated altogether  as adults: such treatment terrifies them and over-burdens them with  responsibility.
 In truth, very few adults care to be called on for  independence and originality: they also are bewildered and terrified  in the absence of precedents and precepts and commandments; but modern  Democracy allows them a sanctioning and cancelling power if they are  capable of using it, which children are not.
 To treat a child wholly  as an adult would be to mock and destroy it.
 Infantile docility and  juvenile dependence are, like death, a product of Natural Selection;  and though there is no viler crime than to abuse them, yet there is no  greater cruelty than to ignore them.
 I have complained sufficiently  of what I suffered through the process of assault, imprisonment,  and compulsory lessons that taught me nothing, which are called my  schooling.
 But I could say a good deal also about the things I was not  taught and should have been taught, not to mention the things I was  allowed to do which I should not have been allowed to do.
 I have no  recollection of being taught to read or write; so I presume I was born  with both faculties; but many people seem to have bitter recollections  of being forced reluctantly to acquire them.
 And though I have the  uttermost contempt for a teacher so ill mannered and incompetent as to  be unable to make a child learn to read and write without also making it  cry, still I am prepared to admit that I had rather have been compelled  to learn to read and write with tears by an incompetent and ill mannered  person than left in ignorance.
 Reading, writing, and enough arithmetic  to use money honestly and accurately, together with the rudiments of law  and order, become necessary conditions of a child's liberty before it  can appreciate the importance of its liberty, or foresee that these  accomplishments are worth acquiring.
 Nature has provided for this by  evolving the instinct of docility.
 Children are very docile: they have  a sound intuition that they must do what they are told or perish.
 And  adults have an intuition, equally sound, that they must take advantage  of this docility to teach children how to live properly or the children  will not survive.
 The difficulty is to know where to stop.
 To illustrate  this, let us consider the main danger of childish docility and parental  officiousness.
          The Abuse of Docility    Docility may survive as a lazy habit long after it has ceased to be a  beneficial instinct.
 If you catch a child when it is young enough to be  instinctively docile, and keep it in a condition of unremitted tutelage  under the nurserymaid, the governess, the preparatory school, the  secondary school, and the university, until it is an adult, you will  produce, not a self-reliant, free, fully matured human being, but a  grown-up schoolboy or schoolgirl, capable of nothing in the way of  original or independent action except outbursts of naughtiness in the  women and blackguardism in the men.
 That is exactly what we get at  present in our rich and consequently governing classes: they pass from  juvenility to senility without ever touching maturity except in body.
  The classes which cannot afford this sustained tutelage are notably more  self-reliant and grown-up: an office boy of fifteen is often more of a  man than a university student of twenty.
 Unfortunately this precocity  is disabled by poverty, ignorance, narrowness, and a hideous power of  living without art or love or beauty and being rather proud of it.
 The  poor never escape from servitude: their docility is preserved by their  slavery.
 And so all become the prey of the greedy, the selfish, the  domineering, the unscrupulous, the predatory.
 If here and there an  individual refuses to be docile, ten docile persons will beat him or  lock him up or shoot him or hang him at the bidding of his oppressors  and their own.
 The crux of the whole difficulty about parents,  schoolmasters, priests, absolute monarchs, and despots of every sort,  is the tendency to abuse natural docility.
 A nation should always be  healthily rebellious; but the king or prime minister has yet to be found  who will make trouble by cultivating that side of the national spirit.
 A  child should begin to assert itself early, and shift for itself more  and more not only in washing and dressing itself, but in opinions and  conduct; yet as nothing is so exasperating and so unlovable as an uppish  child, it is useless to expect parents and schoolmasters to inculcate  this uppishness.
 Such unamiable precepts as Always contradict an  authoritative statement, Always return a blow, Never lose a chance of a  good fight, When you are scolded for a mistake ask the person who scolds  you whether he or she supposes you did it on purpose, and follow the  question with a blow or an insult or some other unmistakable expression  of resentment, Remember that the progress of the world depends on your  knowing better than your elders, are just as important as those of The  Sermon on the Mount; but no one has yet seen them written up in letters  of gold in a schoolroom or nursery.
 The child is taught to be kind, to  be respectful, to be quiet, not to answer back, to be truthful when its  elders want to find out anything from it, to lie when the truth would  shock or hurt its elders, to be above all things obedient, and to be  seen and not heard.
 Here we have two sets of precepts, each warranted  to spoil a child hopelessly if the other be omitted.
 Unfortunately we  do not allow fair play between them.
 The rebellious, intractable,  aggressive, selfish set provoke a corrective resistance, and do not  pretend to high moral or religious sanctions; and they are never urged  by grown-up people on young people.
 They are therefore more in danger  of neglect or suppression than the other set, which have all the adults,  all the laws, all the religions on their side.
 How is the child to be  secured its due share of both bodies of doctrine?          The Schoolboy and the Homeboy    In practice what happens is that parents notice that boys brought up at  home become mollycoddles, or prigs, or duffers, unable to take care of  themselves.
 They see that boys should learn to rough it a little and  to mix with children of their own age.
 This is natural enough.
 When you  have preached at and punished a boy until he is a moral cripple, you  are as much hampered by him as by a physical cripple; and as you do not  intend to have him on your hands all your life, and are generally rather  impatient for the day when he will earn his own living and leave you to  attend to yourself, you sooner or later begin to talk to him about the  need for self-reliance, learning to think, and so forth, with the result  that your victim, bewildered by your inconsistency, concludes that there  is no use trying to please you, and falls into an attitude of sulky  resentment.
 Which is an additional inducement to pack him off to school.
    In school, he finds himself in a dual world, under two dispensations.
  There is the world of the boys, where the point of honor is to be  untameable, always ready to fight, ruthless in taking the conceit out of  anyone who ventures to give himself airs of superior knowledge or taste,  and generally to take Lucifer for one's model.
 And there is the world of  the masters, the world of discipline, submission, diligence, obedience,  and continual and shameless assumption of moral and intellectual  authority.
 Thus the schoolboy hears both sides, and is so far better  off than the homebred boy who hears only one.
 But the two sides are  not fairly presented.
 They are presented as good and evil, as vice and  virtue, as villainy and heroism.
 The boy feels mean and cowardly when  he obeys, and selfish and rascally when he disobeys.
 He looses his moral  courage just as he comes to hate books and languages.
 In the end, John  Ruskin, tied so close to his mother's apron-string that he did not  escape even when he went to Oxford, and John Stuart Mill, whose father  ought to have been prosecuted for laying his son's childhood waste with  lessons, were superior, as products of training, to our schoolboys.
 They  were very conspicuously superior in moral courage; and though they did  not distinguish themselves at cricket and football, they had quite as  much physical hardihood as any civilized man needs.
 But it is to be  observed that Ruskin's parents were wise people who gave John a full  share in their own life, and put up with his presence both at home and  abroad when they must sometimes have been very weary of him; and Mill,  as it happens, was deliberately educated to challenge all the most  sacred institutions of his country.
 The households they were brought  up in were no more average households than a Montessori school is an  average school.
          The Comings of Age of Children    All this inculcated adult docility, which wrecks every civilization as  it is wrecking ours, is inhuman and unnatural.
 We must reconsider our  institution of the Coming of Age, which is too late for some purposes,  and too early for others.
 There should be a series of Coming of Ages for  every individual.
 The mammals have their first coming of age when they  are weaned; and it is noteworthy that this rather cruel and selfish  operation on the part of the parent has to be performed resolutely, with  claws and teeth; for your little mammal does not want to be weaned, and  yields only to a pretty rough assertion of the right of the parent to  be relieved of the child as soon as the child is old enough to bear the  separation.
 The same thing occurs with children: they hang on to the  mother's apron-string and the father's coat tails as long as they can,  often baffling those sensitive parents who know that children should  think for themselves and fend for themselves, but are too kind to throw  them on their own resources with the ferocity of the domestic cat.
 The  child should have its first coming of age when it is weaned, another  when it can talk, another when it can walk, another when it can dress  itself without assistance; and when it can read, write, count money, and  pass an examination in going a simple errand involving a purchase and  a journey by rail or other public method of locomotion, it should have  quite a majority.
 At present the children of laborers are soon mobile  and able to shift for themselves, whereas it is possible to find  grown-up women in the rich classes who are actually afraid to take a  walk in the streets unattended and unprotected.
 It is true that this  is a superstition from the time when a retinue was part of the state  of persons of quality, and the unattended person was supposed to be a  common person of no quality, earning a living; but this has now become  so absurd that children and young women are no longer told why they are  forbidden to go about alone, and have to be persuaded that the streets  are dangerous places, which of course they are; but people who are not  educated to live dangerously have only half a life, and are more likely  to die miserably after all than those who have taken all the common  risks of freedom from their childhood onward as matters of course.
          The Conflict of Wills    The world wags in spite of its schools and its families because both  schools and families are mostly very largely anarchic: parents and  schoolmasters are good-natured or weak or lazy; and children are docile  and affectionate and very shortwinded in their fits of naughtiness; and  so most families slummock along and muddle through until the children  cease to be children.
 In the few cases when the parties are energetic  and determined, the child is crushed or the parent is reduced to a  cipher, as the case may be.
 When the opposed forces are neither of them  strong enough to annihilate the other, there is serious trouble: that  is how we get those feuds between parent and child which recur to our  memory so ironically when we hear people sentimentalizing about natural  affection.
 We even get tragedies; for there is nothing so tragic to  contemplate or so devastating to suffer as the oppression of will  without conscience; and the whole tendency of our family and school  system is to set the will of the parent and the school despot above  conscience as something that must be deferred to abjectly and absolutely  for its own sake.
    The strongest, fiercest force in nature is human will.
 It is the highest  organization we know of the will that has created the whole universe.
  Now all honest civilization, religion, law, and convention is an attempt  to keep this force within beneficent bounds.
 What corrupts civilization,  religion, law, and convention (and they are at present pretty nearly  as corrupt as they dare) is the constant attempts made by the wills of  individuals and classes to thwart the wills and enslave the powers  of other individuals and classes.
 The powers of the parent and the  schoolmaster, and of their public analogues the lawgiver and the  judge, become instruments of tyranny in the hands of those who are too  narrow-minded to understand law and exercise judgment; and in their  hands (with us they mostly fall into such hands) law becomes tyranny.
  And what is a tyrant? Quite simply a person who says to another person,  young or old, "You shall do as I tell you; you shall make what I want;  you shall profess my creed; you shall have no will of your own; and  your powers shall be at the disposal of my will.
" It has come to this at  last: that the phrase "she has a will of her own," or "he has a will  of his own" has come to denote a person of exceptional obstinacy and  self-assertion.
 And even persons of good natural disposition, if  brought up to expect such deference, are roused to unreasoning fury,  and sometimes to the commission of atrocious crimes, by the slightest  challenge to their authority.
 Thus a laborer may be dirty, drunken,  untruthful, slothful, untrustworthy in every way without exhausting the  indulgence of the country house.
 But let him dare to be "disrespectful"  and he is a lost man, though he be the cleanest, soberest, most  diligent, most veracious, most trustworthy man in the county.
 Dickens's  instinct for detecting social cankers never served him better than when  he shewed us Mrs Heep teaching her son to "be umble," knowing that if he  carried out that precept he might be pretty well anything else he liked.
  The maintenance of deference to our wills becomes a mania which will  carry the best of us to any extremity.
 We will allow a village of  Egyptian fellaheen or Indian tribesmen to live the lowest life they  please among themselves without molestation; but let one of them slay  an Englishman or even strike him on the strongest provocation, and  straightway we go stark mad, burning and destroying, shooting and  shelling, flogging and hanging, if only such survivors as we may leave  are thoroughly cowed in the presence of a man with a white face.
 In  the committee room of a local council or city corporation, the humblest  employees of the committee find defenders if they complain of harsh  treatment.
 Gratuities are voted, indulgences and holidays are pleaded  for, delinquencies are excused in the most sentimental manner provided  only the employee, however patent a hypocrite or incorrigible a slacker,  is hat in hand.
 But let the most obvious measure of justice be demanded  by the secretary of a Trade Union in terms which omit all expressions  of subservience, and it is with the greatest difficulty that the  cooler-headed can defeat angry motions that the letter be thrown into  the waste paper basket and the committee proceed to the next business.
          The Demagogue's Opportunity    And the employee has in him the same fierce impulse to impose his will  without respect for the will of others.
 Democracy is in practice nothing  but a device for cajoling from him the vote he refuses to arbitrary  authority.
 He will not vote for Coriolanus; but when an experienced  demagogue comes along and says, "Sir: _you_ are the dictator: the  voice of the people is the voice of God; and I am only your very humble  servant," he says at once, "All right: tell me what to dictate," and  is presently enslaved more effectually with his own silly consent than  Coriolanus would ever have enslaved him without asking his leave.
 And  the trick by which the demagogue defeats Coriolanus is played on him in  his turn by _his_ inferiors.
 Everywhere we see the cunning succeeding  in the world by seeking a rich or powerful master and practising on his  lust for subservience.
 The political adventurer who gets into parliament  by offering himself to the poor voter, not as his representative but as  his will-less soulless "delegate," is himself the dupe of a clever wife  who repudiates Votes for Women, knowing well that whilst the man is  master, the man's mistress will rule.
 Uriah Heep may be a crawling  creature; but his crawling takes him upstairs.
    Thus does the selfishness of the will turn on itself, and obtain by  flattery what it cannot seize by open force.
 Democracy becomes the  latest trick of tyranny: "womanliness" becomes the latest wile of  prostitution.
    Between parent and child the same conflict wages and the same  destruction of character ensues.
 Parents set themselves to bend the will  of their children to their own--to break their stubborn spirit, as  they call it--with the ruthlessness of Grand Inquisitors.
 Cunning,  unscrupulous children learn all the arts of the sneak in circumventing  tyranny: children of better character are cruelly distressed and more or  less lamed for life by it.
          Our Quarrelsomeness    As between adults, we find a general quarrelsomeness which makes  political reform as impossible to most Englishmen as to hogs.
 Certain  sections of the nation get cured of this disability.
 University men,  sailors, and politicians are comparatively free from it, because the  communal life of the University, the fact that in a ship a man must  either learn to consider others or else go overboard or into irons, and  the habit of working on committees and ceasing to expect more of  one's own way than is included in the greatest common measure of the  committee, educate the will socially.
 But no one who has ever had to  guide a committee of ordinary private Englishmen through their first  attempts at collective action, in committee or otherwise, can retain  any illusions as to the appalling effects on our national manners  and character of the organization of the home and the school as petty  tyrannies, and the absence of all teaching of self-respect and training  in self-assertion.
 Bullied and ordered about, the Englishman obeys like  a sheep, evades like a knave, or tries to murder his oppressor.
 Merely  criticized or opposed in committee, or invited to consider anybody's  views but his own, he feels personally insulted and wants to resign  or leave the room unless he is apologized to.
 And his panic and  bewilderment when he sees that the older hands at the work have no  patience with him and do not intend to treat him as infallible, are  pitiable as far as they are anything but ludicrous.
 That is what comes  of not being taught to consider other people's wills, and left to submit  to them or to over-ride them as if they were the winds and the weather.
  Such a state of mind is incompatible not only with the democratic  introduction of high civilization, but with the comprehension and  maintenance of such civilized institutions as have been introduced by  benevolent and intelligent despots and aristocrats.
          We Must Reform Society before we can Reform Ourselves    When we come to the positive problem of what to do with children if we  are to give up the established plan, we find the difficulties so great  that we begin to understand why so many people who detest the system and  look back with loathing on their own schooldays, must helplessly send  their children to the very schools they themselves were sent to, because  there is no alternative except abandoning the children to undisciplined  vagabondism.
 Man in society must do as everybody else does in his class:  only fools and romantic novices imagine that freedom is a mere matter of  the readiness of the individual to snap his fingers at convention.
 It  is true that most of us live in a condition of quite unnecessary  inhibition, wearing ugly and uncomfortable clothes, making ourselves and  other people miserable by the heathen horrors of mourning, staying away  from the theatre because we cannot afford the stalls and are ashamed  to go to the pit, and in dozens of other ways enslaving ourselves  when there are comfortable alternatives open to us without any real  drawbacks.
 The contemplation of these petty slaveries, and of the  triumphant ease with which sensible people throw them off, creates an  impression that if we only take Johnson's advice to free our minds from  cant, we can achieve freedom.
 But if we all freed our minds from cant  we should find that for the most part we should have to go on doing  the necessary work of the world exactly as we did it before until we  organized new and free methods of doing it.
 Many people believed in  secondary co-education (boys and girls taught together) before schools  like Bedales were founded: indeed the practice was common enough in  elementary schools and in Scotland; but their belief did not help them  until Bedales and St George's were organized; and there are still not  nearly enough co-educational schools in existence to accommodate all  the children of the parents who believe in co-education up to university  age, even if they could always afford the fees of these exceptional  schools.
 It may be edifying to tell a duke that our public schools are  all wrong in their constitution and methods, or a costermonger that  children should be treated as in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister instead of as  they are treated at the elementary school at the corner of his street;  but what are the duke and the coster to do? Neither of them has any  effective choice in the matter: their children must either go to the  schools that are, or to no school at all.
 And as the duke thinks with  reason that his son will be a lout or a milksop or a prig if he does  not go to school, and the coster knows that his son will become an  illiterate hooligan if he is left to the streets, there is no real  alternative for either of them.
 Child life must be socially organized:  no parent, rich or poor, can choose institutions that do not exist; and  the private enterprise of individual school masters appealing to a  group of well-to-do parents, though it may shew what can be done by  enthusiasts with new methods, cannot touch the mass of our children.
  For the average parent or child nothing is really available except the  established practice; and this is what makes it so important that the  established practice should be a sound one, and so useless for clever  individuals to disparage it unless they can organize an alternative  practice and make it, too, general.
          The Pursuit of Manners    If you cross-examine the duke and the coster, you will find that they  are not concerned for the scholastic attainments of their children.
  Ask the duke whether he could pass the standard examination of  twelve-year-old children in elementary schools, and he will admit,  with an entirely placid smile, that he would almost certainly be  ignominiously plucked.
 And he is so little ashamed of or disadvantaged  by his condition that he is not prepared to spend an hour in remedying  it.
 The coster may resent the inquiry instead of being amused by it;  but his answer, if true, will be the same.
 What they both want for their  children is the communal training, the apprenticeship to society, the  lessons in holding one's own among people of all sorts with whom one is  not, as in the home, on privileged terms.
 These can be acquired only by  "mixing with the world," no matter how wicked the world is.
 No parent  cares twopence whether his children can write Latin hexameters or  repeat the dates of the accession of all the English monarchs since the  Conqueror; but all parents are earnestly anxious about the manners of  their children.
 Better Claude Duval than Kaspar Hauser.
 Laborers who are  contemptuously anti-clerical in their opinions will send their  daughters to the convent school because the nuns teach them some sort  of gentleness of speech and behavior.
 And peers who tell you that our  public schools are rotten through and through, and that our Universities  ought to be razed to the foundations, send their sons to Eton and  Oxford, Harrow and Cambridge, not only because there is nothing else to  be done, but because these places, though they turn out blackguards  and ignoramuses and boobies galore, turn them out with the habits and  manners of the society they belong to.
 Bad as those manners are in many  respects, they are better than no manners at all.
 And no individual or  family can possibly teach them.
 They can be acquired only by living in  an organized community in which they are traditional.
    Thus we see that there are reasons for the segregation of children even  in families where the great reason: namely, that children are nuisances  to adults, does not press very hardly, as, for instance, in the houses  of the very poor, who can send their children to play in the streets,  or the houses of the very rich, which are so large that the children's  quarters can be kept out of the parents' way like the servants'  quarters.
          Not too much Wind on the Heath, Brother    What, then, is to be done? For the present, unfortunately, little except  propagating the conception of Children's Rights.
 Only the achievement  of economic equality through Socialism can make it possible to deal  thoroughly with the question from the point of view of the total  interest of the community, which must always consist of grown-up  children.
 Yet economic equality, like all simple and obvious  arrangements, seems impossible to people brought up as children are now.
  Still, something can be done even within class limits.
 Large communities  of children of the same class are possible today; and voluntary  organization of outdoor life for children has already begun in Boy  Scouting and excursions of one kind or another.
 The discovery that  anything, even school life, is better for the child than home life,  will become an over-ridden hobby; and we shall presently be told by our  faddists that anything, even camp life, is better than school life.
  Some blundering beginnings of this are already perceptible.
 There is a  movement for making our British children into priggish little barefooted  vagabonds, all talking like that born fool George Borrow, and supposed  to be splendidly healthy because they would die if they slept in rooms  with the windows shut, or perhaps even with a roof over their heads.
  Still, this is a fairly healthy folly; and it may do something to  establish Mr Harold Cox's claim of a Right to Roam as the basis of a  much needed law compelling proprietors of land to provide plenty of  gates in their fences, and to leave them unlocked when there are no  growing crops to be damaged nor bulls to be encountered, instead of, as  at present, imprisoning the human race in dusty or muddy thoroughfares  between walls of barbed wire.
    The reaction against vagabondage will come from the children themselves.
  For them freedom will not mean the expensive kind of savagery now called  "the simple life.
" Their natural disgust with the visions of cockney  book fanciers blowing themselves out with "the wind on the heath,  brother," and of anarchists who are either too weak to understand that  men are strong and free in proportion to the social pressure they  can stand and the complexity of the obligations they are prepared to  undertake, or too strong to realize that what is freedom to them may be  terror and bewilderment to others, will drive them back to the home and  the school if these have meanwhile learned the lesson that children are  independent human beings and have rights.
          Wanted: a Child's Magna Charta    Whether we shall presently be discussing a Juvenile Magna Charta or  Declaration of Rights by way of including children in the Constitution  is a question on which I leave others to speculate.
 But if it could  once be established that a child has an adult's Right of Egress from  uncomfortable places and unpleasant company, and there were children's  lawyers to sue pedagogues and others for assault and imprisonment, there  would be an amazing change in the behavior of schoolmasters, the quality  of school books, and the amenities of school life.
 That Consciousness of  Consent which, even in its present delusive form, has enabled Democracy  to oust tyrannical systems in spite of all its vulgarities and  stupidities and rancors and ineptitudes and ignorances, would operate as  powerfully among children as it does now among grown-ups.
 No doubt the  pedagogue would promptly turn demagogue, and woo his scholars by all the  arts of demagogy; but none of these arts can easily be so dishonorable  or mischievous as the art of caning.
 And, after all, if larger liberties  are attached to the acquisition of knowledge, and the child finds  that it can no more go to the seaside without a knowledge of the  multiplication and pence tables than it can be an astronomer without  mathematics, it will learn the multiplication table, which is more than  it always does at present, in spite of all the canings and keepings in.
          The Pursuit of Learning    When the Pursuit of Learning comes to mean the pursuit of learning by  the child instead of the pursuit of the child by Learning, cane in  hand, the danger will be precocity of the intellect, which is just as  undesirable as precocity of the emotions.
 We still have a silly habit of  talking and thinking as if intellect were a mechanical process and not a  passion; and in spite of the German tutors who confess openly that three  out of every five of the young men they coach for examinations are lamed  for life thereby; in spite of Dickens and his picture of little Paul  Dombey dying of lessons, we persist in heaping on growing children and  adolescent youths and maidens tasks Pythagoras would have declined out  of common regard for his own health and common modesty as to his own  capacity.
 And this overwork is not all the effect of compulsion; for  the average schoolmaster does not compel his scholars to learn: he only  scolds and punishes them if they do not, which is quite a different  thing, the net effect being that the school prisoners need not learn  unless they like.
 Nay, it is sometimes remarked that the school  dunce--meaning the one who does not like--often turns out well  afterwards, as if idleness were a sign of ability and character.
 A much  more sensible explanation is that the so-called dunces are not exhausted  before they begin the serious business of life.
 It is said that boys  will be boys; and one can only add one wishes they would.
 Boys really  want to be manly, and are unfortunately encouraged thoughtlessly in this  very dangerous and overstraining aspiration.
 All the people who have  really worked (Herbert Spencer for instance) warn us against work as  earnestly as some people warn us against drink.
 When learning is placed  on the voluntary footing of sport, the teacher will find himself saying  every day "Run away and play: you have worked as much as is good for  you.
" Trying to make children leave school will be like trying to make  them go to bed; and it will be necessary to surprise them with the idea  that teaching is work, and that the teacher is tired and must go play or  rest or eat: possibilities always concealed by that infamous humbug  the current schoolmaster, who achieves a spurious divinity and a witch  doctor's authority by persuading children that he is not human, just as  ladies persuade them that they have no legs.
          Children and Game: a Proposal    Of the many wild absurdities of our existing social order perhaps the  most grotesque is the costly and strictly enforced reservation of large  tracts of country as deer forests and breeding grounds for pheasants  whilst there is so little provision of the kind made for children.
  I have more than once thought of trying to introduce the shooting  of children as a sport, as the children would then be preserved very  carefully for ten months in the year, thereby reducing their death rate  far more than the fusillades of the sportsmen during the other two would  raise it.
 At present the killing of a fox except by a pack of foxhounds  is regarded with horror; but you may and do kill children in a hundred  and fifty ways provided you do not shoot them or set a pack of dogs on  them.
 It must be admitted that the foxes have the best of it; and indeed  a glance at our pheasants, our deer, and our children will convince the  most sceptical that the children have decidedly the worst of it.
    This much hope, however, can be extracted from the present state of  things.
 It is so fantastic, so mad, so apparently impossible, that no  scheme of reform need ever henceforth be discredited on the ground that  it is fantastic or mad or apparently impossible.
 It is the sensible  schemes, unfortunately, that are hopeless in England.
 Therefore I have  great hopes that my own views, though fundamentally sensible, can be  made to appear fantastic enough to have a chance.
    First, then, I lay it down as a prime condition of sane society, obvious  as such to anyone but an idiot, that in any decent community, children  should find in every part of their native country, food, clothing,  lodging, instruction, and parental kindness for the asking.
 For the  matter of that, so should adults; but the two cases differ in that as  these commodities do not grow on the bushes, the adults cannot have  them unless they themselves organize and provide the supply, whereas the  children must have them as if by magic, with nothing to do but rub the  lamp, like Aladdin, and have their needs satisfied.
          The Parents' Intolerable Burden    There is nothing new in this: it is how children have always had and  must always have their needs satisfied.
 The parent has to play the part  of Aladdin's djinn; and many a parent has sunk beneath the burden of  this service.
 All the novelty we need is to organize it so that instead  of the individual child fastening like a parasite on its own particular  parents, the whole body of children should be thrown not only upon the  whole body of parents, but upon the celibates and childless as well,  whose present exemption from a full share in the social burden of  children is obviously unjust and unwholesome.
 Today it is easy to find a  widow who has at great cost to herself in pain, danger, and disablement,  borne six or eight children.
 In the same town you will find rich  bachelors and old maids, and married couples with no children or with  families voluntarily limited to two or three.
 The eight children do not  belong to the woman in any real or legal sense.
 When she has reared  them they pass away from her into the community as independent persons,  marrying strangers, working for strangers, spending on the community the  life that has been built up at her expense.
 No more monstrous injustice  could be imagined than that the burden of rearing the children should  fall on her alone and not on the celibates and the selfish as well.
    This is so far recognized that already the child finds, wherever it  goes, a school for it, and somebody to force it into the school; and  more and more these schools are being driven by the mere logic of facts  to provide the children with meals, with boots, with spectacles, with  dentists and doctors.
 In fact, when the child's parents are destitute or  not to be found, bread, lodging, and clothing are provided.
 It is true  that they are provided grudgingly and on conditions infamous enough to  draw down abundant fire from Heaven upon us every day in the shape of  crime and disease and vice; but still the practice of keeping children  barely alive at the charge of the community is established; and there is  no need for me to argue about it.
 I propose only two extensions of the  practice.
 One is to provide for all the child's reasonable human wants,  on which point, if you differ from me, I shall take leave to say that  you are socially a fool and personally an inhuman wretch.
 The other is  that these wants should be supplied in complete freedom from compulsory  schooling or compulsory anything except restraint from crime, though,  as they can be supplied only by social organization, the child must be  conscious of and subject to the conditions of that organization, which  may involve such portions of adult responsibility and duty as a child  may be able to bear according to its age, and which will in any case  prevent it from forming the vagabond and anarchist habit of mind.
    One more exception might be necessary: compulsory freedom.
 I am sure  that a child should not be imprisoned in a school.
 I am not so sure that  it should not sometimes be driven out into the open--imprisoned in the  woods and on the mountains, as it were.
 For there are frowsty children,  just as there are frowsty adults, who dont want freedom.
 This morbid  result of over-domestication would, let us hope, soon disappear with its  cause.
          Mobilization    Those who see no prospect held out to them by this except a country in  which all the children shall be roaming savages, should consider, first,  whether their condition would be any worse than that of the little caged  savages of today, and second, whether either children or adults are  so apt to run wild that it is necessary to tether them fast to one  neighborhood to prevent a general dissolution of society.
 My own  observation leads me to believe that we are not half mobilized enough.
  True, I cannot deny that we are more mobile than we were.
 You will still  find in the home counties old men who have never been to London, and who  tell you that they once went to Winchester or St Albans much as if they  had been to the South Pole; but they are not so common as the clerk who  has been to Paris or to Lovely Lucerne, and who "goes away somewhere"  when he has a holiday.
 His grandfather never had a holiday, and, if he  had, would no more have dreamed of crossing the Channel than of taking  a box at the Opera.
 But with all allowance for the Polytechnic excursion  and the tourist agency, our inertia is still appalling.
 I confess to  having once spent nine years in London without putting my nose  outside it; and though this was better, perhaps, than the restless  globe-trotting vagabondage of the idle rich, wandering from hotel to  hotel and never really living anywhere, yet I should no more have done  it if I had been properly mobilized in my childhood than I should have  worn the same suit of clothes all that time (which, by the way, I very  nearly did, my professional income not having as yet begun to sprout).
  There are masses of people who could afford at least a trip to Margate,  and a good many who could afford a trip round the world, who are more  immovable than Aldgate pump.
 To others, who would move if they knew how,  travelling is surrounded with imaginary difficulties and terrors.
 In  short, the difficulty is not to fix people, but to root them up.
 We keep  repeating the silly proverb that a rolling stone gathers no moss, as if  moss were a desirable parasite.
 What we mean is that a vagabond does not  prosper.
 Even this is not true, if prosperity means enjoyment as well as  responsibility and money.
 The real misery of vagabondage is the misery  of having nothing to do and nowhere to go, the misery of being derelict  of God and Man, the misery of the idle, poor or rich.
 And this is one  of the miseries of unoccupied childhood.
 The unoccupied adult, thus  afflicted, tries many distractions which are, to say the least, unsuited  to children.
 But one of them, the distraction of seeing the world, is  innocent and beneficial.
 Also it is childish, being a continuation of  what nurses call "taking notice," by which a child becomes experienced.
  It is pitiable nowadays to see men and women doing after the age of 45  all the travelling and sightseeing they should have done before they  were 15.
 Mere wondering and staring at things is an important part of  a child's education: that is why children can be thoroughly mobilized  without making vagabonds of them.
 A vagabond is at home nowhere because  he wanders: a child should wander because it ought to be at home  everywhere.
 And if it has its papers and its passports, and gets what  it requires not by begging and pilfering, but from responsible agents  of the community as of right, and with some formal acknowledgment of  the obligations it is incurring and a knowledge of the fact that these  obligations are being recorded: if, further, certain qualifications are  exacted before it is promoted from permission to go as far as its  legs will carry it to using mechanical aids to locomotion, it can roam  without much danger of gypsification.
    Under such circumstances the boy or girl could always run away, and  never be lost; and on no other conditions can a child be free without  being also a homeless outcast.
    Parents could also run away from disagreeable children or drive them out  of doors or even drop their acquaintance, temporarily or permanently,  without inhumanity.
 Thus both parties would be on their good behavior,  and not, as at present, on their filial or parental behavior, which,  like all unfree behavior, is mostly bad behavior.
    As to what other results might follow, we had better wait and see; for  nobody now alive can imagine what customs and institutions would grow  up in societies of free children.
 Child laws and child fashions, child  manners and child morals are now not tolerated; but among free children  there would certainly be surprising developments in this direction.
 I do  not think there would be any danger of free children behaving as badly  as grown-up people do now because they have never been free.
 They could  hardly behave worse, anyhow.
          Children's Rights and Parents' Wrongs    A very distinguished man once assured a mother of my acquaintance that  she would never know what it meant to be hurt until she was hurt through  her children.
 Children are extremely cruel without intending it; and  in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the reason is that they do not  conceive their elders as having any human feelings.
 Serve the elders  right, perhaps, for posing as superhuman! The penalty of the impostor  is not that he is found out (he very seldom is) but that he is taken  for what he pretends to be, and treated as such.
 And to be treated as  anything but what you really are may seem pleasant to the imagination  when the treatment is above your merits; but in actual experience it  is often quite the reverse.
 When I was a very small boy, my romantic  imagination, stimulated by early doses of fiction, led me to brag to a  still smaller boy so outrageously that he, being a simple soul, really  believed me to be an invincible hero.
 I cannot remember whether this  pleased me much; but I do remember very distinctly that one day this  admirer of mine, who had a pet goat, found the animal in the hands of a  larger boy than either of us, who mocked him and refused to restore the  animal to his rightful owner.
 Whereupon, naturally, he came weeping  to me, and demanded that I should rescue the goat and annihilate the  aggressor.
 My terror was beyond description: fortunately for me, it  imparted such a ghastliness to my voice and aspect as I under the eye of  my poor little dupe, advanced on the enemy with that hideous extremity  of cowardice which is called the courage of despair, and said "You let  go that goat," that he abandoned his prey and fled, to my unforgettable,  unspeakable relief.
 I have never since exaggerated my prowess in bodily  combat.
    Now what happened to me in the adventure of the goat happens very often  to parents, and would happen to schoolmasters if the prison door of the  school did not shut out the trials of life.
 I remember once, at school,  the resident head master was brought down to earth by the sudden illness  of his wife.
 In the confusion that ensued it became necessary to  leave one of the schoolrooms without a master.
 I was in the class that  occupied that schoolroom.
 To have sent us home would have been to break  the fundamental bargain with our parents by which the school was bound  to keep us out of their way for half the day at all hazards.
 Therefore  an appeal had to be made to our better feelings: that is, to our common  humanity, not to make a noise.
 But the head master had never admitted  any common humanity with us.
 We had been carefully broken in to regard  him as a being quite aloof from and above us: one not subject to error  or suffering or death or illness or mortality.
 Consequently sympathy was  impossible; and if the unfortunate lady did not perish, it was because,  as I now comfort myself with guessing, she was too much pre-occupied  with her own pains, and possibly making too much noise herself, to be  conscious of the pandemonium downstairs.
    A great deal of the fiendishness of schoolboys and the cruelty of  children to their elders is produced just in this way.
 Elders cannot be  superhuman beings and suffering fellow-creatures at the same time.
 If  you pose as a little god, you must pose for better for worse.
          How Little We Know About Our Parents    The relation between parent and child has cruel moments for the parent  even when money is no object, and the material worries are delegated to  servants and school teachers.
 The child and the parent are strangers  to one another necessarily, because their ages must differ widely.
 Read  Goethe's autobiography; and note that though he was happy in his  parents and had exceptional powers of observation, divination, and  story-telling, he knew less about his father and mother than about most  of the other people he mentions.
 I myself was never on bad terms with  my mother: we lived together until I was forty-two years old, absolutely  without the smallest friction of any kind; yet when her death set me  thinking curiously about our relations, I realized that I knew very  little about her.
 Introduce me to a strange woman who was a child when  I was a child, a girl when I was a boy, an adolescent when I was an  adolescent; and if we take naturally to one another I will know more of  her and she of me at the end of forty days (I had almost said of  forty minutes) than I knew of my mother at the end of forty years.
 A  contemporary stranger is a novelty and an enigma, also a possibility;  but a mother is like a broomstick or like the sun in the heavens, it  does not matter which as far as one's knowledge of her is concerned:  the broomstick is there and the sun is there; and whether the child is  beaten by it or warmed and enlightened by it, it accepts it as a fact  in nature, and does not conceive it as having had youth, passions, and  weaknesses, or as still growing, yearning, suffering, and learning.
 If  I meet a widow I may ask her all about her marriage; but what son ever  dreams of asking his mother about her marriage, or could endure to hear  of it without violently breaking off the old sacred relationship between  them, and ceasing to be her child or anything more to her than the first  man in the street might be?    Yet though in this sense the child cannot realize its parent's  humanity, the parent can realize the child's; for the parents with their  experience of life have none of the illusions about the child that the  child has about the parents; and the consequence is that the child  can hurt its parents' feelings much more than its parents can hurt  the child's, because the child, even when there has been none of the  deliberate hypocrisy by which children are taken advantage of by their  elders, cannot conceive the parent as a fellow-creature, whilst the  parents know very well that the children are only themselves over again.
  The child cannot conceive that its blame or contempt or want of interest  could possibly hurt its parent, and therefore expresses them all with  an indifference which has given rise to the term _enfant terrible_ (a  tragic term in spite of the jests connected with it); whilst the parent  can suffer from such slights and reproaches more from a child than from  anyone else, even when the child is not beloved, because the child is so  unmistakably sincere in them.
          Our Abandoned Mothers    Take a very common instance of this agonizing incompatibility.
 A widow  brings up her son to manhood.
 He meets a strange woman, and goes off  with and marries her, leaving his mother desolate.
 It does not occur to  him that this is at all hard on her: he does it as a matter of course,  and actually expects his mother to receive, on terms of special  affection, the woman for whom she has been abandoned.
 If he shewed any  sense of what he was doing, any remorse; if he mingled his tears with  hers and asked her not to think too hardly of him because he had obeyed  the inevitable destiny of a man to leave his father and mother and  cleave to his wife, she could give him her blessing and accept her  bereavement with dignity and without reproach.
 But the man never dreams  of such considerations.
 To him his mother's feeling in the matter, when  she betrays it, is unreasonable, ridiculous, and even odious, as shewing  a prejudice against his adorable bride.
    I have taken the widow as an extreme and obvious case; but there are  many husbands and wives who are tired of their consorts, or disappointed  in them, or estranged from them by infidelities; and these parents, in  losing a son or a daughter through marriage, may be losing everything  they care for.
 No parent's love is as innocent as the love of a child:  the exclusion of all conscious sexual feeling from it does not exclude  the bitterness, jealousy, and despair at loss which characterize sexual  passion: in fact, what is called a pure love may easily be more selfish  and jealous than a carnal one.
 Anyhow, it is plain matter of fact that  naively selfish people sometimes try with fierce jealousy to prevent  their children marrying.
          Family Affection    Until the family as we know it ceases to exist, nobody will dare to  analyze parental affection as distinguished from that general human  sympathy which has secured to many an orphan fonder care in a stranger's  house than it would have received from its actual parents.
 Not even  Tolstoy, in The Kreutzer Sonata, has said all that we suspect about it.
  When it persists beyond the period at which it ceases to be necessary to  the child's welfare, it is apt to be morbid; and we are probably wrong  to inculcate its deliberate cultivation.
 The natural course is for  the parents and children to cast off the specific parental and filial  relation when they are no longer necessary to one another.
 The  child does this readily enough to form fresh ties, closer and more  fascinating.
 Parents are not always excluded from such compensations:  it happens sometimes that when the children go out at the door the lover  comes in at the window.
 Indeed it happens now oftener than it used to,  because people remain much longer in the sexual arena.
 The cultivated  Jewess no longer cuts off her hair at her marriage.
 The British matron  has discarded her cap and her conscientious ugliness; and a bishop's  wife at fifty has more of the air of a _femme galante_ than an actress  had at thirty-five in her grandmother's time.
 But as people marry later,  the facts of age and time still inexorably condemn most parents to  comparative solitude when their children marry.
 This may be a privation  and may be a relief: probably in healthy circumstances it is no worse  than a salutary change of habit; but even at that it is, for the moment  at least, a wrench.
 For though parents and children sometimes dislike  one another, there is an experience of succor and a habit of dependence  and expectation formed in infancy which naturally attaches a child to  its parent or to its nurse (a foster parent) in a quite peculiar way.
  A benefit to the child may be a burden to the parent; but people become  attached to their burdens sometimes more than the burdens are attached  to them; and to "suffer little children" has become an affectionate  impulse deep in our nature.
    Now there is no such impulse to suffer our sisters and brothers,  our aunts and uncles, much less our cousins.
 If we could choose our  relatives, we might, by selecting congenial ones, mitigate the repulsive  effect of the obligation to like them and to admit them to our intimacy.
  But to have a person imposed on us as a brother merely because he  happens to have the same parents is unbearable when, as may easily  happen, he is the sort of person we should carefully avoid if he were  anyone else's brother.
 All Europe (except Scotland, which has clans  instead of families) draws the line at second cousins.
 Protestantism  draws it still closer by making the first cousin a marriageable  stranger; and the only reason for not drawing it at sisters and brothers  is that the institution of the family compels us to spend our  childhood with them, and thus imposes on us a curious relation in which  familiarity destroys romantic charm, and is yet expected to create a  specially warm affection.
 Such a relation is dangerously factitious and  unnatural; and the practical moral is that the less said at home about  specific family affection the better.
 Children, like grown-up people,  get on well enough together if they are not pushed down one another's  throats; and grown-up relatives will get on together in proportion  to their separation and their care not to presume on their blood  relationship.
 We should let children's feelings take their natural  course without prompting.
 I have seen a child scolded and called  unfeeling because it did not occur to it to make a theatrical  demonstration of affectionate delight when its mother returned after an  absence: a typical example of the way in which spurious family sentiment  is stoked up.
 We are, after all, sociable animals; and if we are let  alone in the matter of our affections, and well brought up otherwise,  we shall not get on any the worse with particular people because they  happen to be our brothers and sisters and cousins.
 The danger lies in  assuming that we shall get on any better.
    The main point to grasp here is that families are not kept together at  present by family feeling but by human feeling.
 The family cultivates  sympathy and mutual help and consolation as any other form of kindly  association cultivates them; but the addition of a dictated compulsory  affection as an attribute of near kinship is not only unnecessary,  but positively detrimental; and the alleged tendency of modern social  development to break up the family need alarm nobody.
 We cannot break up  the facts of kinship nor eradicate its natural emotional consequences.
  What we can do and ought to do is to set people free to behave naturally  and to change their behavior as circumstances change.
 To impose on  a citizen of London the family duties of a Highland cateran in the  eighteenth century is as absurd as to compel him to carry a claymore and  target instead of an umbrella.
 The civilized man has no special use  for cousins; and he may presently find that he has no special use for  brothers and sisters.
 The parent seems likely to remain indispensable;  but there is no reason why that natural tie should be made the excuse  for unnatural aggravations of it, as crushing to the parent as they are  oppressive to the child.
 The mother and father will not always have  to shoulder the burthen of maintenance which should fall on the Atlas  shoulders of the fatherland and motherland.
 Pending such reforms and  emancipations, a shattering break-up of the parental home must remain  one of the normal incidents of marriage.
 The parent is left lonely and  the child is not.
 Woe to the old if they have no impersonal interests,  no convictions, no public causes to advance, no tastes or hobbies! It is  well to be a mother but not to be a mother-in-law; and if men were cut  off artificially from intellectual and public interests as women are,  the father-in-law would be as deplorable a figure in popular tradition  as the mother-in-law.
    It is not to be wondered at that some people hold that blood  relationship should be kept a secret from the persons related, and that  the happiest condition in this respect is that of the foundling who, if  he ever meets his parents or brothers or sisters, passes them by without  knowing them.
 And for such a view there is this to be said: that our  family system does unquestionably take the natural bond between members  of the same family, which, like all natural bonds, is not too tight to  be borne, and superimposes on it a painful burden of forced, inculcated,  suggested, and altogether unnecessary affection and responsibility which  we should do well to get rid of by making relatives as independent of  one another as possible.
          The Fate of the Family    The difficulty of inducing people to talk sensibly about the family is  the same as that which I pointed out in a previous volume as  confusing discussions of marriage.
 Marriage is not a single invariable  institution: it changes from civilization to civilization, from religion  to religion, from civil code to civil code, from frontier to frontier.
  The family is still more variable, because the number of persons  constituting a family, unlike the number of persons constituting a  marriage, varies from one to twenty: indeed, when a widower with a  family marries a widow with a family, and the two produce a third  family, even that very high number may be surpassed.
 And the conditions  may vary between opposite extremes: for example, in a London or Paris  slum every child adds to the burden of poverty and helps to starve the  parents and all the other children, whereas in a settlement of pioneer  colonists every child, from the moment it is big enough to lend a hand  to the family industry, is an investment in which the only danger is  that of temporary over-capitalization.
 Then there are the variations  in family sentiment.
 Sometimes the family organization is as frankly  political as the organization of an army or an industry: fathers being  no more expected to be sentimental about their children than colonels  about soldiers, or factory owners about their employees, though the  mother may be allowed a little tenderness if her character is weak.
 The  Roman father was a despot: the Chinese father is an object of worship:  the sentimental modern western father is often a play-fellow looked to  for toys and pocket-money.
 The farmer sees his children constantly: the  squire sees them only during the holidays, and not then oftener than he  can help: the tram conductor, when employed by a joint stock company,  sometimes never sees them at all.
    Under such circumstances phrases like The Influence of Home Life, The  Family, The Domestic Hearth, and so on, are no more specific than The  Mammals, or The Man In The Street; and the pious generalizations founded  so glibly on them by our sentimental moralists are unworkable.
  When households average twelve persons with the sexes about equally  represented, the results may be fairly good.
 When they average three the  results may be very bad indeed; and to lump the two together under  the general term The Family is to confuse the question hopelessly.
 The  modern small family is much too stuffy: children "brought up at home"  in it are unfit for society.
 But here again circumstances differ.
 If the  parents live in what is called a garden suburb, where there is a good  deal of social intercourse, and the family, instead of keeping itself to  itself, as the evil old saying is, and glowering at the neighbors over  the blinds of the long street in which nobody knows his neighbor and  everyone wishes to deceive him as to his income and social importance,  is in effect broken up by school life, by out-of-door habits, and by  frank neighborly intercourse through dances and concerts and theatricals  and excursions and the like, families of four may turn out much less  barbarous citizens than families of ten which attain the Boer ideal of  being out of sight of one another's chimney smoke.
    All one can say is, roughly, that the homelier the home, and the more  familiar the family, the worse for everybody concerned.
 The family ideal  is a humbug and a nuisance: one might as reasonably talk of the barrack  ideal, or the forecastle ideal, or any other substitution of the  machinery of social organization for the end of it, which must always  be the fullest and most capable life: in short, the most godly life.
 And  this significant word reminds us that though the popular conception of  heaven includes a Holy Family, it does not attach to that family  the notion of a separate home, or a private nursery or kitchen or  mother-in-law, or anything that constitutes the family as we know it.
  Even blood relationship is miraculously abstracted from it; and the  Father is the father of all children, the mother the mother of all  mothers and babies, and the Son the Son of Man and the Savior of his  brothers: one whose chief utterance on the subject of the conventional  family was an invitation to all of us to leave our families and follow  him, and to leave the dead to bury the dead, and not debauch ourselves  at that gloomy festival the family funeral, with its sequel of hideous  mourning and grief which is either affected or morbid.
          Family Mourning    I do not know how far this detestable custom of mourning is carried in  France; but judging from the appearance of the French people I should  say that a Frenchwoman goes into mourning for her cousins to the  seventeenth degree.
 The result is that when I cross the Channel I seem  to have reached a country devastated by war or pestilence.
 It is really  suffering only from the family.
 Will anyone pretend that England has  not the best of this striking difference? Yet it is such senseless and  unnatural conventions as this that make us so impatient of what we call  family feeling.
 Even apart from its insufferable pretensions, the family  needs hearty discrediting; for there is hardly any vulnerable part of it  that could not be amputated with advantage.
          Art Teaching    By art teaching I hasten to say that I do not mean giving children  lessons in freehand drawing and perspective.
 I am simply calling  attention to the fact that fine art is the only teacher except torture.
  I have already pointed out that nobody, except under threat of torture,  can read a school book.
 The reason is that a school book is not a work  of art.
 Similarly, you cannot listen to a lesson or a sermon unless the  teacher or the preacher is an artist.
 You cannot read the Bible if you  have no sense of literary art.
 The reason why the continental European  is, to the Englishman or American, so surprisingly ignorant of the  Bible, is that the authorized English version is a great work of  literary art, and the continental versions are comparatively artless.
  To read a dull book; to listen to a tedious play or prosy sermon or  lecture; to stare at uninteresting pictures or ugly buildings: nothing,  short of disease, is more dreadful than this.
 The violence done to our  souls by it leaves injuries and produces subtle maladies which have  never been properly studied by psycho-pathologists.
 Yet we are so inured  to it in school, where practically all the teachers are bores trying  to do the work of artists, and all the books artless, that we acquire  a truly frightful power of enduring boredom.
 We even acquire the notion  that fine art is lascivious and destructive to the character.
 In church,  in the House of Commons, at public meetings, we sit solemnly listening  to bores and twaddlers because from the time we could walk or speak we  have been snubbed, scolded, bullied, beaten and imprisoned whenever we  dared to resent being bored or twaddled at, or to express our natural  impatience and derision of bores and twaddlers.
 And when a man arises  with a soul of sufficient native strength to break the bonds of this  inculcated reverence and to expose and deride and tweak the noses of our  humbugs and panjandrums, like Voltaire or Dickens, we are shocked and  scandalized, even when we cannot help laughing.
 Worse, we dread and  persecute those who can see and declare the truth, because their  sincerity and insight reflects on our delusion and blindness.
 We are  all like Nell Gwynne's footman, who defended Nell's reputation with his  fists, not because he believed her to be what he called an honest woman,  but because he objected to be scorned as the footman of one who was no  better than she should be.
    This wretched power of allowing ourselves to be bored may seem to give  the fine arts a chance sometimes.
 People will sit through a performance  of Beethoven's ninth symphony or of Wagner's Ring just as they will sit  through a dull sermon or a front bench politician saying nothing for two  hours whilst his unfortunate country is perishing through the delay  of its business in Parliament.
 But their endurance is very bad for the  ninth symphony, because they never hiss when it is murdered.
 I have  heard an Italian conductor (no longer living) take the _adagio_ of that  symphony at a lively _allegretto_, slowing down for the warmer major  sections into the speed and manner of the heroine's death song in a  Verdi opera; and the listeners, far from relieving my excruciation by  rising with yells of fury and hurling their programs and opera glasses  at the miscreant, behaved just as they do when Richter conducts it.
 The  mass of imposture that thrives on this combination of ignorance with  despairing endurance is incalculable.
 Given a public trained from  childhood to stand anything tedious, and so saturated with school  discipline that even with the doors open and no schoolmasters to stop  them they will sit there helplessly until the end of the concert or  opera gives them leave to go home; and you will have in great capitals  hundreds of thousands of pounds spent every night in the season on  professedly artistic entertainments which have no other effect on fine  art than to exacerbate the hatred in which it is already secretly held  in England.
    Fortunately, there are arts that cannot be cut off from the people by  bad performances.
 We can read books for ourselves; and we can play  a good deal of fine music for ourselves with the help of a pianola.
  Nothing stands between us and the actual handwork of the great masters  of painting except distance; and modern photographic methods of  reproduction are in some cases quite and in many nearly as effective in  conveying the artist's message as a modern edition of Shakespear's plays  is in conveying the message that first existed in his handwriting.
 The  reproduction of great feats of musical execution is already on the  way: the phonograph, for all its wheezing and snarling and braying, is  steadily improving in its manners; and what with this improvement on the  one hand, and on the other that blessed selective faculty which enables  us to ignore a good deal of disagreeable noise if there is a thread  of music in the middle of it (few critics of the phonograph seem to be  conscious of the very considerable mechanical noise set up by choirs  and orchestras) we have at last reached a point at which, for example,  a person living in an English village where the church music is the only  music, and that music is made by a few well-intentioned ladies with  the help of a harmonium, can hear masses by Palestrina very passably  executed, and can thereby be led to the discovery that Jackson in F and  Hymns Ancient and Modern are not perhaps the last word of beauty and  propriety in the praise of God.
    In short, there is a vast body of art now within the reach of everybody.
  The difficulty is that this art, which alone can educate us in grace of  body and soul, and which alone can make the history of the past live for  us or the hope of the future shine for us, which alone can give delicacy  and nobility to our crude lusts, which is the appointed vehicle of  inspiration and the method of the communion of saints, is actually  branded as sinful among us because, wherever it arises, there is  resistance to tyranny, breaking of fetters, and the breath of freedom.
  The attempt to suppress art is not wholly successful: we might as well  try to suppress oxygen.
 But it is carried far enough to inflict on huge  numbers of people a most injurious art starvation, and to corrupt a  great deal of the art that is tolerated.
 You will find in England plenty  of rich families with little more culture than their dogs and horses.
  And you will find poor families, cut off by poverty and town life  from the contemplation of the beauty of the earth, with its dresses of  leaves, its scarves of cloud, and its contours of hill and valley, who  would positively be happier as hogs, so little have they cultivated  their humanity by the only effective instrument of culture: art.
 The  dearth is artificially maintained even when there are the means of  satisfying it.
 Story books are forbidden, picture post cards are  forbidden, theatres are forbidden, operas are forbidden, circuses are  forbidden, sweetmeats are forbidden, pretty colors are forbidden, all  exactly as vice is forbidden.
 The Creator is explicitly prayed to, and  implicitly convicted of indecency every day.
 An association of vice and  sin with everything that is delightful and of goodness with everything  that is wretched and detestable is set up.
 All the most perilous (and  glorious) appetites and propensities are at once inflamed by starvation  and uneducated by art.
 All the wholesome conditions which art imposes on  appetite are waived: instead of cultivated men and women restrained by  a thousand delicacies, repelled by ugliness, chilled by vulgarity,  horrified by coarseness, deeply and sweetly moved by the graces that art  has revealed to them and nursed in them, we get indiscriminate rapacity  in pursuit of pleasure and a parade of the grossest stimulations in  catering for it.
 We have a continual clamor for goodness, beauty,  virtue, and sanctity, with such an appalling inability to recognize  it or love it when it arrives that it is more dangerous to be a great  prophet or poet than to promote twenty companies for swindling simple  folk out of their savings.
 Do not for a moment suppose that uncultivated  people are merely indifferent to high and noble qualities.
 They hate  them malignantly.
 At best, such qualities are like rare and beautiful  birds: when they appear the whole country takes down its guns; but the  birds receive the statuary tribute of having their corpses stuffed.
    And it really all comes from the habit of preventing children from  being troublesome.
 You are so careful of your boy's morals, knowing how  troublesome they may be, that you keep him away from the Venus of Milo  only to find him in the arms of the scullery maid or someone much worse.
  You decide that the Hermes of Praxiteles and Wagner's Tristan are not  suited for young girls; and your daughter marries somebody appallingly  unlike either Hermes or Tristan solely to escape from your parental  protection.
 You have not stifled a single passion nor averted a single  danger: you have depraved the passions by starving them, and broken down  all the defences which so effectively protect children brought up in  freedom.
 You have men who imagine themselves to be ministers of religion  openly declaring that when they pass through the streets they have  to keep out in the wheeled traffic to avoid the temptations of the  pavement.
 You have them organizing hunts of the women who tempt  them--poor creatures whom no artist would touch without a shudder--and  wildly clamoring for more clothes to disguise and conceal the body, and  for the abolition of pictures, statues, theatres, and pretty colors.
  And incredible as it seems, these unhappy lunatics are left at large,  unrebuked, even admired and revered, whilst artists have to struggle for  toleration.
 To them an undraped human body is the most monstrous, the  most blighting, the most obscene, the most unbearable spectacle in the  universe.
 To an artist it is, at its best, the most admirable spectacle  in nature, and, at its average, an object of indifference.
 If every rag  of clothing miraculously dropped from the inhabitants of London at noon  tomorrow (say as a preliminary to the Great Judgment), the artistic  people would not turn a hair; but the artless people would go mad and  call on the mountains to hide them.
 I submit that this indicates a  thoroughly healthy state on the part of the artists, and a thoroughly  morbid one on the part of the artless.
 And the healthy state is  attainable in a cold country like ours only by familiarity with the  undraped figure acquired through pictures, statues, and theatrical  representations in which an illusion of natural clotheslessness is  produced and made poetic.
    In short, we all grow up stupid and mad to just the extent to which we  have not been artistically educated; and the fact that this taint of  stupidity and madness has to be tolerated because it is general, and is  even boasted of as characteristically English, makes the situation all  the worse.
 It is becoming exceedingly grave at present, because the last  ray of art is being cut off from our schools by the discontinuance of  religious education.
          The Impossibility of Secular Education    Now children must be taught some sort of religion.
 Secular education is  an impossibility.
 Secular education comes to this: that the only reason  for ceasing to do evil and learning to do well is that if you do not you  will be caned.
 This is worse than being taught in a church school that  if you become a dissenter you will go to hell; for hell is presented as  the instrument of something eternal, divine, and inevitable: you cannot  evade it the moment the schoolmaster's back is turned.
 What confuses  this issue and leads even highly intelligent religious persons to  advocate secular education as a means of rescuing children from the  strife of rival proselytizers is the failure to distinguish between  the child's personal subjective need for a religion and its right to  an impartially communicated historical objective knowledge of all the  creeds and Churches.
 Just as a child, no matter what its race and color  may be, should know that there are black men and brown men and yellow  men, and, no matter what its political convictions may be, that  there are Monarchists and Republicans and Positivists, Socialists and  Unsocialists, so it should know that there are Christians and Mahometans  and Buddhists and Shintoists and so forth, and that they are on the  average just as honest and well-behaved as its own father.
 For example,  it should not be told that Allah is a false god set up by the Turks and  Arabs, who will all be damned for taking that liberty; but it should be  told that many English people think so, and that many Turks and Arabs  think the converse about English people.
 It should be taught that Allah  is simply the name by which God is known to Turks and Arabs, who are  just as eligible for salvation as any Christian.
 Further, that the  practical reason why a Turkish child should pray in a mosque and an  English child in a church is that as worship is organized in Turkey in  mosques in the name of Mahomet and in England in churches in the name  of Christ, a Turkish child joining the Church of England or an English  child following Mahomet will find that it has no place for its worship  and no organization of its religion within its reach.
 Any other teaching  of the history and present facts of religion is false teaching, and is  politically extremely dangerous in an empire in which a huge majority of  the fellow subjects of the governing island do not profess the religion  of that island.
    But this objectivity, though intellectually honest, tells the child  only what other people believe.
 What it should itself believe is quite  another matter.
 The sort of Rationalism which says to a child "You must  suspend your judgment until you are old enough to choose your religion"  is Rationalism gone mad.
 The child must have a conscience and a code  of honor (which is the essence of religion) even if it be only a  provisional one, to be revised at its confirmation.
 For confirmation is  meant to signalize a spiritual coming of age, and may be a repudiation.
  Really active souls have many confirmations and repudiations as their  life deepens and their knowledge widens.
 But what is to guide the child  before its first confirmation? Not mere orders, because orders must  have a sanction of some sort or why should the child obey them? If, as a  Secularist, you refuse to teach any sanction, you must say "You will  be punished if you disobey.
" "Yes," says the child to itself, "if I am  found out; but wait until your back is turned and I will do as I like,  and lie about it.
" There can be no objective punishment for successful  fraud; and as no espionage can cover the whole range of a child's  conduct, the upshot is that the child becomes a liar and schemer with an  atrophied conscience.
 And a good many of the orders given to it are not  obeyed after all.
 Thus the Secularist who is not a fool is forced to  appeal to the child's vital impulse towards perfection, to the divine  spark; and no resolution not to call this impulse an impulse of loyalty  to the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost, or obedience to the Will of God,  or any other standard theological term, can alter the fact that the  Secularist has stepped outside Secularism and is educating the child  religiously, even if he insists on repudiating that pious adverb and  substituting the word metaphysically.
          Natural Selection as a Religion    We must make up our minds to it therefore that whatever measures we may  be forced to take to prevent the recruiting sergeants of the Churches,  free or established, from obtaining an exclusive right of entry to  schools, we shall not be able to exclude religion from them.
 The most  horrible of all religions: that which teaches us to regard ourselves  as the helpless prey of a series of senseless accidents called Natural  Selection, is allowed and even welcomed in so-called secular schools  because it is, in a sense, the negation of all religion; but for school  purposes a religion is a belief which affects conduct; and no belief  affects conduct more radically and often so disastrously as the belief  that the universe is a product of Natural Selection.
 What is more, the  theory of Natural Selection cannot be kept out of schools, because  many of the natural facts that present the most plausible appearance  of design can be accounted for by Natural Selection; and it would be so  absurd to keep a child in delusive ignorance of so potent a factor  in evolution as to keep it in ignorance of radiation or capillary  attraction.
 Even if you make a religion of Natural Selection, and  teach the child to regard itself as the irresponsible prey of its  circumstances and appetites (or its heredity as you will perhaps call  them), you will none the less find that its appetites are stimulated by  your encouragement and daunted by your discouragement; that one of its  appetites is an appetite for perfection; that if you discourage this  appetite and encourage the cruder acquisitive appetites the child will  steal and lie and be a nuisance to you; and that if you encourage its  appetite for perfection and teach it to attach a peculiar sacredness  to it and place it before the other appetites, it will be a much nicer  child and you will have a much easier job, at which point you will,  in spite of your pseudoscientific jargon, find yourself back in the  old-fashioned religious teaching as deep as Dr.
 Watts and in fact  fathoms deeper.
          Moral Instruction Leagues    And now the voices of our Moral Instruction Leagues will be lifted,  asking whether there is any reason why the appetite for perfection  should not be cultivated in rationally scientific terms instead of being  associated with the story of Jonah and the great fish and the thousand  other tales that grow up round religions.
 Yes: there are many reasons;  and one of them is that children all like the story of Jonah and the  whale (they insist on its being a whale in spite of demonstrations by  Bible smashers without any sense of humor that Jonah would not have  fitted into a whale's gullet--as if the story would be credible of a  whale with an enlarged throat) and that no child on earth can stand  moral instruction books or catechisms or any other statement of the case  for religion in abstract terms.
 The object of a moral instruction book  is not to be rational, scientific, exact, proof against controversy, nor  even credible: its object is to make children good; and if it makes them  sick instead its place is the waste-paper basket.
    Take for an illustration the story of Elisha and the bears.
 To the  authors of the moral instruction books it is in the last degree  reprehensible.
 It is obviously not true as a record of fact; and the  picture it gives us of the temper of God (which is what interests an  adult reader) is shocking and blasphemous.
 But it is a capital story for  a child.
 It interests a child because it is about bears; and it leaves  the child with an impression that children who poke fun at old gentlemen  and make rude remarks about bald heads are not nice children, which is  a highly desirable impression, and just as much as a child is capable  of receiving from the story.
 When a story is about God and a child,  children take God for granted and criticize the child.
 Adults do the  opposite, and are thereby led to talk great nonsense about the bad  effect of Bible stories on infants.
    But let no one think that a child or anyone else can learn religion from  a teacher or a book or by any academic process whatever.
 It is only  by an unfettered access to the whole body of Fine Art: that is, to the  whole body of inspired revelation, that we can build up that conception  of divinity to which all virtue is an aspiration.
 And to hope to find  this body of art purified from all that is obsolete or dangerous  or fierce or lusty, or to pick and choose what will be good for any  particular child, much less for all children, is the shallowest  of vanities.
 Such schoolmasterly selection is neither possible nor  desirable.
 Ignorance of evil is not virtue but imbecility: admiring  it is like giving a prize for honesty to a man who has not stolen your  watch because he did not know you had one.
 Virtue chooses good from  evil; and without knowledge there can be no choice.
 And even this is a  dangerous simplification of what actually occurs.
 We are not choosing:  we are growing.
 Were you to cut all of what you call the evil out of  a child, it would drop dead.
 If you try to stretch it to full human  stature when it is ten years old, you will simply pull it into two  pieces and be hanged.
 And when you try to do this morally, which is what  parents and schoolmasters are doing every day, you ought to be hanged;  and some day, when we take a sensible view of the matter, you will be;  and serve you right.
 The child does not stand between a good and a  bad angel: what it has to deal with is a middling angel who, in normal  healthy cases, wants to be a good angel as fast as it can without  killing itself in the process, which is a dangerous one.
    Therefore there is no question of providing the child with a carefully  regulated access to good art.
 There is no good art, any more than there  is good anything else in the absolute sense.
 Art that is too good for  the child will either teach it nothing or drive it mad, as the Bible has  driven many people mad who might have kept their sanity had they been  allowed to read much lower forms of literature.
 The practical moral is  that we must read whatever stories, see whatever pictures, hear whatever  songs and symphonies, go to whatever plays we like.
 We shall not like  those which have nothing to say to us; and though everyone has a right  to bias our choice, no one has a right to deprive us of it by keeping us  from any work of art or any work of art from us.
    I may now say without danger of being misunderstood that the popular  English compromise called Cowper Templeism (unsectarian Bible education)  is not so silly as it looks.
 It is true that the Bible inculcates half  a dozen religions: some of them barbarous; some cynical and pessimistic;  some amoristic and romantic; some sceptical and challenging; some  kindly, simple, and intuitional; some sophistical and intellectual; none  suited to the character and conditions of western civilization unless it  be the Christianity which was finally suppressed by the Crucifixion, and  has never been put into practice by any State before or since.
 But the  Bible contains the ancient literature of a very remarkable Oriental  race; and the imposition of this literature, on whatever false  pretences, on our children left them more literate than if they knew  no literature at all, which was the practical alternative.
 And as our  Authorized Version is a great work of art as well, to know it was better  than knowing no art, which also was the practical alternative.
 It is  at least not a school book; and it is not a bad story book, horrible as  some of the stories are.
 Therefore as between the Bible and the blank  represented by secular education, the choice is with the Bible.
          The Bible    But the Bible is not sufficient.
 The real Bible of modern Europe is the  whole body of great literature in which the inspiration and revelation  of Hebrew Scripture has been continued to the present day.
 Nietzsche's  Thus Spake Zoroaster is less comforting to the ill and unhappy than the  Psalms; but it is much truer, subtler, and more edifying.
 The pleasure  we get from the rhetoric of the book of Job and its tragic picture of a  bewildered soul cannot disguise the ignoble irrelevance of the retort of  God with which it closes, or supply the need of such modern revelations  as Shelley's Prometheus or The Niblung's Ring of Richard Wagner.
 There  is nothing in the Bible greater in inspiration than Beethoven's ninth  symphony; and the power of modern music to convey that inspiration to  a modern man is far greater than that of Elizabethan English, which is,  except for people steeped in the Bible from childhood like Sir Walter  Scott and Ruskin, a dead language.
    Besides, many who have no ear for literature or for music are accessible  to architecture, to pictures, to statues, to dresses, and to the arts of  the stage.
 Every device of art should be brought to bear on the young;  so that they may discover some form of it that delights them naturally;  for there will come to all of them that period between dawning  adolescence and full maturity when the pleasures and emotions of art  will have to satisfy cravings which, if starved or insulted, may become  morbid and seek disgraceful satisfactions, and, if prematurely gratified  otherwise than poetically, may destroy the stamina of the race.
 And it  must be borne in mind that the most dangerous art for this necessary  purpose is the art that presents itself as religious ecstasy.
 Young  people are ripe for love long before they are ripe for religion.
 Only  a very foolish person would substitute the Imitation of Christ for  Treasure Island as a present for a boy or girl, or for Byron's Don Juan  as a present for a swain or lass.
 Pickwick is the safest saint for us in  our nonage.
 Flaubert's Temptation of St Anthony is an excellent book  for a man of fifty, perhaps the best within reach as a healthy study of  visionary ecstasy; but for the purposes of a boy of fifteen Ivanhoe and  the Templar make a much better saint and devil.
 And the boy of  fifteen will find this out for himself if he is allowed to wander in a  well-stocked literary garden, and hear bands and see pictures and spend  his pennies on cinematograph shows.
 His choice may often be rather  disgusting to his elders when they want him to choose the best before he  is ready for it.
 The greatest Protestant Manifesto ever written, as  far as I know, is Houston Chamberlain's Foundations of the Nineteenth  Century: everybody capable of it should read it.
 Probably the History of  Maria Monk is at the opposite extreme of merit (this is a guess: I have  never read it); but it is certain that a boy let loose in a library  would go for Maria Monk and have no use whatever for Mr Chamberlain.
 I  should probably have read Maria Monk myself if I had not had the Arabian  Nights and their like to occupy me better.
 In art, children, like  adults, will find their level if they are left free to find it, and not  restricted to what adults think good for them.
 Just at present our  young people are going mad over ragtimes, apparently because syncopated  rhythms are new to them.
 If they had learnt what can be done with  syncopation from Beethoven's third Leonora overture, they would enjoy  the ragtimes all the more; but they would put them in their proper place  as amusing vulgarities.
          Artist Idolatry    But there are more dangerous influences than ragtimes waiting for people  brought up in ignorance of fine art.
 Nothing is more pitiably ridiculous  than the wild worship of artists by those who have never been seasoned  in youth to the enchantments of art.
 Tenors and prima donnas, pianists  and violinists, actors and actresses enjoy powers of seduction which in  the middle ages would have exposed them to the risk of being burnt  for sorcery.
 But as they exercise this power by singing, playing, and  acting, no great harm is done except perhaps to themselves.
 Far graver  are the powers enjoyed by brilliant persons who are also connoisseurs  in art.
 The influence they can exercise on young people who have been  brought up in the darkness and wretchedness of a home without art, and  in whom a natural bent towards art has always been baffled and snubbed,  is incredible to those who have not witnessed and understood it.
 He (or  she) who reveals the world of art to them opens heaven to them.
 They  become satellites, disciples, worshippers of the apostle.
 Now the  apostle may be a voluptuary without much conscience.
 Nature may have  given him enough virtue to suffice in a reasonable environment.
 But this  allowance may not be enough to defend him against the temptation and  demoralization of finding himself a little god on the strength of  what ought to be a quite ordinary culture.
 He may find adorers in  all directions in our uncultivated society among people of stronger  character than himself, not one of whom, if they had been artistically  educated, would have had anything to learn from him or regarded him  as in any way extraordinary apart from his actual achievements as an  artist.
 Tartuffe is not always a priest.
 Indeed he is not always a  rascal: he is often a weak man absurdly credited with omniscience and  perfection, and taking unfair advantages only because they are offered  to him and he is too weak to refuse.
 Give everyone his culture, and no  one will offer him more than his due.
    In thus delivering our children from the idolatry of the artist, we  shall not destroy for them the enchantment of art: on the contrary, we  shall teach them to demand art everywhere as a condition attainable  by cultivating the body, mind, and heart.
 Art, said Morris, is the  expression of pleasure in work.
 And certainly, when work is made  detestable by slavery, there is no art.
 It is only when learning is  made a slavery by tyrannical teachers that art becomes loathsome to the  pupil.
          "The Machine"    When we set to work at a Constitution to secure freedom for children, we  had better bear in mind that the children may not be at all obliged to  us for our pains.
 Rousseau said that men are born free; and this saying,  in its proper bearings, was and is a great and true saying; yet let it  not lead us into the error of supposing that all men long for freedom  and embrace it when it is offered to them.
 On the contrary, it has to  be forced on them; and even then they will give it the slip if it is not  religiously inculcated and strongly safeguarded.
    Besides, men are born docile, and must in the nature of things remain so  with regard to everything they do not understand.
 Now political science  and the art of government are among the things they do not understand,  and indeed are not at present allowed to understand.
 They can be  enslaved by a system, as we are at present, because it happens to be  there, and nobody understands it.
 An intelligently worked Capitalist  system, as Comte saw, would give us all that most of us are intelligent  enough to want.
 What makes it produce such unspeakably vile results is  that it is an automatic system which is as little understood by those  who profit by it in money as by those who are starved and degraded by  it: our millionaires and statesmen are manifestly no more "captains  of industry" or scientific politicians than our bookmakers are  mathematicians.
 For some time past a significant word has been coming  into use as a substitute for Destiny, Fate, and Providence.
 It is "The  Machine": the machine that has no god in it.
 Why do governments do  nothing in spite of reports of Royal Commissions that establish the most  frightful urgency? Why do our philanthropic millionaires do nothing,  though they are ready to throw bucketfuls of gold into the streets? The  Machine will not let them.
 Always the Machine.
 In short, they dont know  how.
    They try to reform Society as an old lady might try to restore a broken  down locomotive by prodding it with a knitting needle.
 And this is not  at all because they are born fools, but because they have been educated,  not into manhood and freedom, but into blindness and slavery by  their parents and schoolmasters, themselves the victims of a similar  misdirection, and consequently of The Machine.
 They do not want  liberty.
 They have not been educated to want it.
 They choose slavery and  inequality; and all the other evils are automatically added to them.
    And yet we must have The Machine.
 It is only in unskilled hands under  ignorant direction that machinery is dangerous.
 We can no more govern  modern communities without political machinery than we can feed and  clothe them without industrial machinery.
 Shatter The Machine, and you  get Anarchy.
 And yet The Machine works so detestably at present that we  have people who advocate Anarchy and call themselves Anarchists.
          The Provocation to Anarchism    What is valid in Anarchism is that all Governments try to simplify their  task by destroying liberty and glorifying authority in general and their  own deeds in particular.
 But the difficulty in combining law and  order with free institutions is not a natural one.
 It is a matter of  inculcation.
 If people are brought up to be slaves, it is useless and  dangerous to let them loose at the age of twenty-one and say "Now you  are free.
" No one with the tamed soul and broken spirit of a slave can  be free.
 It is like saying to a laborer brought up on a family income of  thirteen shillings a week, "Here is one hundred thousand pounds: now you  are wealthy.
" Nothing can make such a man really wealthy.
 Freedom and  wealth are difficult and responsible conditions to which men must be  accustomed and socially trained from birth.
 A nation that is free at  twenty-one is not free at all; just as a man first enriched at fifty  remains poor all his life, even if he does not curtail it by drinking  himself to death in the first wild ecstasy of being able to swallow as  much as he likes for the first time.
 You cannot govern men brought up  as slaves otherwise than as slaves are governed.
 You may pile Bills  of Right and Habeas Corpus Acts on Great Charters; promulgate American  Constitutions; burn the chateaux and guillotine the seigneurs; chop  off the heads of kings and queens and set up Democracy on the ruins of  feudalism: the end of it all for us is that already in the twentieth  century there has been as much brute coercion and savage intolerance, as  much flogging and hanging, as much impudent injustice on the bench  and lustful rancor in the pulpit, as much naive resort to torture,  persecution, and suppression of free speech and freedom of the press,  as much war, as much of the vilest excess of mutilation, rapine, and  delirious indiscriminate slaughter of helpless non-combatants, old  and young, as much prostitution of professional talent, literary and  political, in defence of manifest wrong, as much cowardly sycophancy  giving fine names to all this villainy or pretending that it is "greatly  exaggerated," as we can find any record of from the days when the  advocacy of liberty was a capital offence and Democracy was hardly  thinkable.
 Democracy exhibits the vanity of Louis XIV, the savagery  of Peter of Russia, the nepotism and provinciality of Napoleon, the  fickleness of Catherine II: in short, all the childishnesses of all the  despots without any of the qualities that enabled the greatest of them  to fascinate and dominate their contemporaries.
    And the flatterers of Democracy are as impudently servile to the  successful, and insolent to common honest folk, as the flatterers of  the monarchs.
 Democracy in America has led to the withdrawal of ordinary  refined persons from politics; and the same result is coming in England  as fast as we make Democracy as democratic as it is in America.
 This is  true also of popular religion: it is so horribly irreligious that nobody  with the smallest pretence to culture, or the least inkling of what  the great prophets vainly tried to make the world understand, will have  anything to do with it except for purely secular reasons.
          Imagination    Before we can clearly understand how baleful is this condition of  intimidation in which we live, it is necessary to clear up the confusion  made by our use of the word imagination to denote two very different  powers of mind.
 One is the power to imagine things as they are not:  this I call the romantic imagination.
 The other is the power to imagine  things as they are without actually sensing them; and this I will call  the realistic imagination.
 Take for example marriage and war.
 One man  has a vision of perpetual bliss with a domestic angel at home, and of  flashing sabres, thundering guns, victorious cavalry charges, and routed  enemies in the field.
 That is romantic imagination; and the mischief it  does is incalculable.
 It begins in silly and selfish expectations of  the impossible, and ends in spiteful disappointment, sour grievance,  cynicism, and misanthropic resistance to any attempt to better a  hopeless world.
 The wise man knows that imagination is not only a means  of pleasing himself and beguiling tedious hours with romances and fairy  tales and fools' paradises (a quite defensible and delightful amusement  when you know exactly what you are doing and where fancy ends and facts  begin), but also a means of foreseeing and being prepared for realities  as yet unexperienced, and of testing the possibility and desirability of  serious Utopias.
 He does not expect his wife to be an angel; nor does he  overlook the facts that war depends on the rousing of all the murderous  blackguardism still latent in mankind; that every victory means a  defeat; that fatigue, hunger, terror, and disease are the raw material  which romancers work up into military glory; and that soldiers for the  most part go to war as children go to school, because they are afraid  not to.
 They are afraid even to say they are afraid, as such candor is  punishable by death in the military code.
    A very little realistic imagination gives an ambitious person enormous  power over the multitudinous victims of the romantic imagination.
 For  the romancer not only pleases himself with fictitious glories: he also  terrifies himself with imaginary dangers.
 He does not even picture what  these dangers are: he conceives the unknown as always dangerous.
 When  you say to a realist "You must do this" or "You must not do that," he  instantly asks what will happen to him if he does (or does not, as the  case may be).
 Failing an unromantic convincing answer, he does just as  he pleases unless he can find for himself a real reason for refraining.
  In short, though you can intimidate him, you cannot bluff him.
 But  you can always bluff the romantic person: indeed his grasp of real  considerations is so feeble that you find it necessary to bluff him even  when you have solid considerations to offer him instead.
 The campaigns  of Napoleon, with their atmosphere of glory, illustrate this.
 In  the Russian campaign Napoleon's marshals achieved miracles of bluff,  especially Ney, who, with a handful of men, monstrously outnumbered,  repeatedly kept the Russian troops paralyzed with terror by pure  bounce.
 Napoleon himself, much more a realist than Ney (that was why  he dominated him), would probably have surrendered; for sometimes the  bravest of the brave will achieve successes never attempted by the  cleverest of the clever.
 Wellington was a completer realist than  Napoleon.
 It was impossible to persuade Wellington that he was beaten  until he actually was beaten.
 He was unbluffable; and if Napoleon had  understood the nature of Wellington's strength instead of returning  Wellington's snobbish contempt for him by an academic contempt for  Wellington, he would not have left the attack at Waterloo to Ney and  D'Erlon, who, on that field, did not know when they were beaten, whereas  Wellington knew precisely when he was not beaten.
 The unbluffable  would have triumphed anyhow, probably, because Napoleon was an academic  soldier, doing the academic thing (the attack in columns and so forth)  with superlative ability and energy; whilst Wellington was an original  soldier who, instead of outdoing the terrible academic columns with  still more terrible and academic columns, outwitted them with the thin  red line, not of heroes, but, as this uncompromising realist never  hesitated to testify, of the scum of the earth.
          Government by Bullies    These picturesque martial incidents are being reproduced every day in  our ordinary life.
 We are bluffed by hardy simpletons and headstrong  bounders as the Russians were bluffed by Ney; and our Wellingtons  are threadbound by slave-democracy as Gulliver was threadbound by the  Lilliputians.
 We are a mass of people living in a submissive routine to  which we have been drilled from our childhood.
 When you ask us to take  the simplest step outside that routine, we say shyly, "Oh, I really  couldnt," or "Oh, I shouldnt like to," without being able to point out  the smallest harm that could possibly ensue: victims, not of a rational  fear of real dangers, but of pure abstract fear, the quintessence of  cowardice, the very negation of "the fear of God.
" Dotted about among  us are a few spirits relatively free from this inculcated paralysis,  sometimes because they are half-witted, sometimes because they are  unscrupulously selfish, sometimes because they are realists as to money  and unimaginative as to other things, sometimes even because they are  exceptionally able, but always because they are not afraid of shadows  nor oppressed with nightmares.
 And we see these few rising as if by  magic into power and affluence, and forming, with the millionaires who  have accidentally gained huge riches by the occasional windfalls of our  commerce, the governing class.
 Now nothing is more disastrous than  a governing class that does not know how to govern.
 And how can this  rabble of the casual products of luck, cunning, and folly, be expected  to know how to govern? The merely lucky ones and the hereditary ones do  not owe their position to their qualifications at all.
 As to the rest,  the realism which seems their essential qualification often consists not  only in a lack of romantic imagination, which lack is a merit, but  of the realistic, constructive, Utopian imagination, which lack is  a ghastly defect.
 Freedom from imaginative illusion is therefore no  guarantee whatever of nobility of character: that is why inculcated  submissiveness makes us slaves to people much worse than ourselves,  and why it is so important that submissiveness should no longer be  inculcated.
    And yet as long as you have the compulsory school as we know it, we  shall have submissiveness inculcated.
 What is more, until the active  hours of child life are organized separately from the active hours of  adult life, so that adults can enjoy the society of children in reason  without being tormented, disturbed, harried, burdened, and hindered  in their work by them as they would be now if there were no compulsory  schools and no children hypnotized into the belief that they must tamely  go to them and be imprisoned and beaten and over-tasked in them, we  shall have schools under one pretext or another; and we shall have all  the evil consequences and all the social hopelessness that result from  turning a nation of potential freemen and freewomen into a nation of  two-legged spoilt spaniels with everything crushed out of their nature  except dread of the whip.
 Liberty is the breath of life to nations; and  liberty is the one thing that parents, schoolmasters, and rulers spend  their lives in extirpating for the sake of an immediately quiet and  finally disastrous life.

 DANIEL BOON    CONTAINING A NARRATIVE OF THE WARS OF KENTUCKE    From The Discovery and Settlement of Kentucke      By John Filson      Curiosity is natural to the soul of man, and interesting objects have  a powerful influence on our affections.
 Let these influencing powers  actuate, by the permission or disposal of Providence, from selfish or  social views, yet in time the mysterious will of Heaven is unfolded,  and we behold our conduct, from whatsoever motives excited, operating to  answer the important designs of heaven.
 Thus we behold Kentucke, lately  an howling wilderness, the habitation of savages and wild beasts, become  a fruitful field; this region, so favourably distinguished by nature,  now become the habitation of civilization, at a period unparalleled in  history, in the midst of a raging war, and under all the disadvantages  of emigration to a country so remote from the inhabited parts of the  continent.
 Here, where the hand of violence shed the blood of the  innocent; where the horrid yells of savages, and the groans of the  distressed, sounded in our ears, we now hear the praises and adoration  of our Creator; where wretched wigwams stood, the miserable abodes  of savages, we behold the foundations of cities laid, that, in all  probability, will rival the glory of the greatest upon earth.
 And we  view Kentucke situated on the fertile banks of the great Ohio, rising  from obscurity to shine with splendor, equal to any other of the stars  of the American hemisphere.
    The settling of this region well deserves a place in history.
 Most  of the memorable events I have myself been exercised in; and, for the  satisfaction of the public, will briefly relate the circumstances of my  adventures, and scenes of life, from my first movement to this country  until this day.
    It was on the first of May, in the year 1769, that I resigned my  domestic happiness for a time, and left my family and peaceable  habitation on the Yadkin River, in North-Carolina, to wander through the  wilderness of America, in quest of the country of Kentucke, in company  with John Finley, John Stewart, Joseph Holden, James Monay, and William  Cool.
 We proceeded successfully, and after a long and fatiguing journey  through a mountainous wilderness, in a westward direction, on the  seventh day of June following, we found ourselves on Red-River, where  John Finley had formerly been trading with the Indians, and, from the  top of an eminence, saw with pleasure the beautiful level of Kentucke.
  Here let me observe, that for some time we had experienced the most  uncomfortable weather as a prelibation of our future sufferings.
 At this  place we encamped, and made a shelter to defend us from the inclement  season, and began to hunt and reconnoitre the country.
 We found every  where abundance of wild beasts of all sorts, through this vast forest.
  The buffaloes were more frequent than I have seen cattle in the  settlements, browzing on the leaves of the cane, or croping the herbage  on those extensive plains, fearless, because ignorant, of the violence  of man.
 Sometimes we saw hundreds in a drove, and the numbers about the  salt springs were amazing.
 In this forest, the habitation of beasts of  every kind natural to America, we practised hunting with great success  until the twenty-second day of December following.
    This day John Stewart and I had a pleasing ramble, but fortune changed  the scene in the close of it.
 We had passed through a great forest on  which stood myriads of trees, some gay with blossoms, others rich with  fruits.
 Nature was here a series of wonders, and a fund of delight.
 Here  she displayed her ingenuity and industry in a variety of flowers  and fruits, beautifully coloured, elegantly shaped, and charmingly  flavoured; and we were diverted with innumerable animals presenting  themselves perpetually to our view.
--In the decline of the day, near  Kentucke river, as we ascended the brow of a small hill, a number of  Indians rushed out of a thick cane-brake upon us, and made us prisoners.
  The time of our sorrow was now arrived, and the scene fully opened.
 The  Indians plundered us of what we had, and kept us in confinement  seven days, treating us with common savage usage.
 During this time  we discovered no uneasiness or desire to escape, which made them  less suspicious of us; but in the dead of night, as we lay in a thick  cane-brake by a large fire, when sleep had locked up their senses, my  situation not disposing me for rest, I touched my companion and gently  awoke him.
 We improved this favourable opportunity, and departed,  leaving them to take their rest, and speedily directed our course  towards our old camp, but found it plundered, and the company dispersed  and gone home.
 About this time my brother, Squire Boon, with another  adventurer, who came to explore the country shortly after us, was  wandering through the forest, determined to find me, if possible, and  accidentally found our camp.
    Notwithstanding the unfortunate circumstances of our company, and our  dangerous situation, as surrounded with hostile savages, our meeting  so fortunately in the wilderness made us reciprocally sensible of the  utmost satisfaction.
 So much does friendship triumph over misfortune,  that sorrows and sufferings vanish at the meeting not only of real  friends, but of the most distant acquaintances, and substitutes  happiness in their room.
    Soon after this, my companion in captivity, John Stewart, was killed  by the savages, and the man that came with my brother returned home by  himself.
 We were then in a dangerous, helpless situation, exposed daily  to perils and death amongst savages and wild beasts, not a white man in  the country but ourselves.
    Thus situated, many hundred miles from our families in the howling  wilderness, I believe few would have equally enjoyed the happiness we  experienced.
 I often observed to my brother, You see now how little  nature requires to be satisfied.
 Felicity, the companion of content,  is rather found in our own breasts than in the enjoyment of external  things; And I firmly believe it requires but a little philosophy to  make a man happy in whatsoever state he is.
 This consists in a full  resignation to the will of Providence; and a resigned soul finds  pleasure in a path strewed with briars and thorns.
    We continued not in a state of indolence, but hunted every day, and  prepared a little cottage to defend us from the Winter storms.
 We  remained there undisturbed during the Winter; and on the first day of  May, 1770, my brother returned home to the settlement by himself, for  a new recruit of horses and ammunition, leaving me by myself, without  bread, salt or sugar, without company of my fellow creatures, or even  a horse or dog.
 I confess I never before was under greater necessity of  exercising philosophy and fortitude.
 A few days I passed uncomfortably.
  The idea of a beloved wife and family, and their anxiety upon the  account of my absence and exposed situation, made sensible impressions  on my heart.
 A thousand dreadful apprehensions presented themselves  to my view, and had undoubtedly disposed me to melancholy, if further  indulged.
    One day I undertook a tour through the country, and the diversity and  beauties of nature I met with in this charming season, expelled every  gloomy and vexatious thought.
 Just at the close of day the gentle gales  retired, and left the place to the disposal of a profound calm.
 Not  a breeze shook the most tremulous leaf.
 I had gained the summit of a  commanding ridge, and, looking round with astonishing delight, beheld  the ample plains, the beauteous tracts below.
 On the other hand, I  surveyed the famous river Ohio that rolled in silent dignity, marking  the western boundary of Kentucke with inconceivable grandeur.
 At a  vast distance I beheld the mountains lift their venerable brows, and  penetrate the clouds.
 All things were still.
 I kindled a fire near a  fountain of sweet water, and feasted on the loin of a buck, which a few  hours before I had killed.
 The sullen shades of night soon overspread  the whole hemisphere, and the earth seemed to gasp after the hovering  moisture.
 My roving excursion this day had fatigued my body, and  diverted my imagination.
 I laid me down to sleep, and I awoke not until  the sun had chased away the night.
 I continued this tour, and in a  few days explored a considerable part of the country, each day equally  pleased as the first.
 I returned again to my old camp, which was not  disturbed in my absence.
 I did not confine my lodging to it, but often  reposed in thick cane-brakes, to avoid the savages, who, I believe,  often visited my camp, but fortunately for me, in my absence.
 In this  situation I was constantly exposed to danger, and death.
 How unhappy  such a situation for a man tormented with fear, which is vain if  no danger comes, and if it does, only augments the pain.
 It was my  happiness to be destitute of this afflicting passion, with which I had  the greatest reason to be affected.
 The prowling wolves diverted my  nocturnal hours with perpetual howlings; and the various species of  animals in this vast forest, in the daytime, were continually in my  view.
    Thus I was surrounded with plenty in the midst of want.
 I was happy  in the midst of dangers and inconveniences.
 In such a diversity it was  impossible I should be disposed to melancholy.
 No populous city, with  all the varieties of commerce and stately structures, could afford so  much pleasure to my mind, as the beauties of nature I found here.
    Thus, through an uninterrupted scene of sylvan pleasures, I spent the  time until the 27th day of July following, when my brother, to my great  felicity, met me, according to appointment, at our old camp.
 Shortly  after, we left this place, not thinking it safe to stay there longer,  and proceeded to Cumberland river, reconnoitring that part of the  country until March, 1771, and giving names to the different waters.
    Soon after, I returned home to my family with a determination to bring  them as soon as possible to live in Kentucke, which I esteemed a second  paradise, at the risk of my life and fortune.
    I returned safe to my old habitation, and found my family in happy  circumstances.
 I sold my farm on the Yadkin, and what goods we could not  carry with us; and on the twenty-fifth day of September, 1773, bade a  farewel to our friends, and proceeded on our journey to Kentucke, in  company with five families more, and forty men that joined us in Powel's  Valley, which is one hundred and fifty miles from the now settled parts  of Kentucke.
 This promising beginning was soon overcast with a cloud of  adversity; for upon the tenth day of October, the rear of our company  was attacked by a number of Indians, who killed six, and wounded one  man.
 Of these my eldest son was one that fell in the action.
 Though  we defended ourselves, and repulsed the enemy, yet this unhappy affair  scattered our cattle, brought us into extreme difficulty, and so  discouraged the whole company, that we retreated forty miles, to the  settlement on Clench river.
 We had passed over two mountains, viz.
  Powel's and Walden's, and were approaching Cumberland mountain when this  adverse fortune overtook us.
 These mountains are in the wilderness, as  we pass from the old settlements in Virginia to Kentucke, are ranged in  a S.
 west and N.
 east direction, are of a great length and breadth, and  not far distant from each other.
 Over these, nature hath formed passes,  that are less difficult than might be expected from a view of such huge  piles.
 The aspect of these cliffs is so wild and horrid, that it is  impossible to behold them without terror.
 The spectator is apt to  imagine that nature had formerly suffered some violent convulsion; and  that these are the dismembered remains of the dreadful shock; the ruins,  not of Persepolis or Palmyra, but of the world!    I remained with my family on Clench until the sixth of June, 1774,  when I and one Michael Stoner were solicited by Governor Dunmore, of  Virginia, to go to the Falls of the Ohio, to conduct into the settlement  a number of surveyors that had been sent thither by him some months  before; this country having about this time drawn the attention of many  adventurers.
 We immediately complied with the Governor's request, and  conducted in the surveyors, compleating a tour of eight hundred miles,  through many difficulties, in sixty-two days.
    Soon after I returned home, I was ordered to take the command of three  garrisons during the campaign, which Governor Dunmore carried on against  the Shawanese Indians: After the conclusion of which, the Militia was  discharged from each garrrison, and I being relieved from my post,  was solicited by a number of North-Carolina gentlemen, that were about  purchasing the lands lying on the S.
 side of Kentucke River, from the  Cherokee Indians, to attend their treaty at Wataga, in March, 1775, to  negotiate with them, and, mention the boundaries of the purchase.
 This  I accepted, and at the request of the same gentlemen, undertook to  mark out a road in the best passage from the settlement through the  wilderness to Kentucke, with such assistance as I thought necessary to  employ for such an important undertaking.
    I soon began this work, having collected a number of enterprising men,  well armed.
 We proceeded with all possible expedition until we came  within fifteen miles of where Boonsborough now stands, and where we were  fired upon by a party of Indians that killed two, and wounded two of our  number; yet, although surprised and taken at a disadvantage, we stood  our ground.
 This was on the twentieth of March, 1775.
 Three days after,  we were fired upon again, and had two men killed, and three wounded.
  Afterwards we proceeded on to Kentucke river without opposition; and on  the first day of April began to erect the fort of Boonsborough at a salt  lick, about sixty yards from the river, on the S.
 side.
    On the fourth day, the Indians killed one of our men.
--We were busily  employed in building this fort, until the fourteenth day of June  following, without any farther opposition from the Indians; and having  finished the works, I returned to my family, on Clench.
    In a short time, I proceeded to remove my family from Clench to this  garrison; where we arrived safe without any other difficulties than  such as are common to this passage, my wife and daughter being the first  white women that ever stood on the banks of Kentucke river.
    On the twenty-fourth day of December following we had one man killed,  and one wounded, by the Indians, who seemed determined to persecute us  for erecting this fortification.
    On the fourteenth day of July, 1776, two of Col.
 Calaway's daughters,  and one of mine, were taken prisoners near the fort.
 I immediately  pursued the Indians, with only eight men, and on the sixteenth overtook  them, killed two of the party, and recovered the girls.
 The same day  on which this attempt was made, the Indians divided themselves into  different parties, and attacked several forts, which were shortly before  this time erected, doing a great deal of mischief.
 This was extremely  distressing to the new settlers.
 The innocent husbandman was shot down,  while busy cultivating the soil for his family's supply.
 Most of  the cattle around the stations were destroyed.
 They continued their  hostilities in this manner until the fifteenth of April, 1777, when  they attacked Boonsborough with a party of above one hundred in number,  killed one man, and wounded four--Their loss in this attack was not  certainly known to us.
    On the fourth day of July following, a party of about two hundred  Indians attacked Boonsborough, killed one man, and wounded two.
 They  besieged us forty-eight hours; during which time seven of them were  killed, and at last, finding themselves not likely to prevail, they  raised the siege, and departed.
    The Indians had disposed their warriors in different parties at this  time, and attacked the different garrisons to prevent their assisting  each other, and did much injury to the distressed inhabitants.
    On the nineteenth day of this month, Col.
 Logan's fort was besieged by a  party of about two hundred Indians.
 During this dreadful siege they did  a great deal of mischief, distressed the garrison, in which were  only fifteen men, killed two, and wounded one.
 The enemies loss was  uncertain, from the common practice which the Indians have of carrying  off their dead in time of battle.
 Col.
 Harrod's fort was then defended  by only sixty-five men, and Boonsborough by twenty-two, there being  no more forts or white men in the country, except at the Falls, a  considerable distance from these, and all taken collectively, were but a  handful to the numerous warriors that were every where dispersed through  the country, intent upon doing all the mischief that savage barbarity  could invent.
 Thus we passed through a scene of sufferings that exceeds  description.
    On the twenty-fifth of this month a reinforcement of forty-five  men arrived from North-Carolina, and about the twentieth of August  following, Col.
 Bowman arrived with one hundred men from Virginia.
 Now  we began to strengthen, and from hence, for the space of six weeks, we  had skirmishes with Indians, in one quarter or other, almost every day.
    The savages now learned the superiority of the Long Knife, as they call  the Virginians, by experience; being out-generalled in almost every  battle.
 Our affairs began to wear a new aspect, and the enemy, not  daring to venture on open war, practised secret mischief at times.
    On the first day of January, 1778, I went with a party of thirty men  to the Blue Licks, on Licking River, to make salt for the different  garrisons in the country.
    On the seventh day of February, as I was hunting, to procure meat for  the company, I met with a party of one hundred and two Indians, and  two Frenchmen, on their march against Boonsborough, that place being  particularly the object of the enemy.
    They pursued, and took me; and brought me on the eighth day to the  Licks, where twenty-seven of my party were, three of them having  previously returned home with the salt.
 I knowing it was impossible for  them to escape, capitulated with the enemy, and, at a distance in their  view, gave notice to my men of their situation, with orders not to  resist, but surrender themselves captives.
    The generous usage the Indians had promised before in my capitulation,  was afterwards fully complied with, and we proceeded with them as  prisoners to old Chelicothe, the principal Indian town, on Little  Miami, where we arrived, after an uncomfortable journey, in very  severe weather, on the eighteenth day of February, and received as good  treatment as prisoners could expect from savages.
--On the tenth day of  March following, I, and ten of my men, were conducted by forty Indians  to Detroit, where we arrived the thirtieth day, and were treated by  Governor Hamilton, the British commander at that post, with great  humanity.
    During our travels, the Indians entertained me well; and their affection  for me was so great, that they utterly refused to leave me there with  the others, although the Governor offered them one hundred pounds  Sterling for me, on purpose to give me a parole to go home.
 Several  English gentlemen there, being sensible of my adverse fortune, and  touched with human sympathy, generously offered a friendly supply for  my wants, which I refused, with many thanks for their kindness; adding,  that I never expected it would be in my power to recompense such  unmerited generosity.
    The Indians left my men in captivity with the British at Detroit, and  on the tenth day of April brought me towards Old Chelicothe, where we  arrived on the twenty-fifth day of the same month.
 This was a long and  fatiguing march, through an exceeding fertile country, remarkable for  fine springs and streams of water.
 At Chelicothe I spent my time as  comfortably as I could expect; was adopted, accordin to their custom,  into a family where I became a son, and had a great share in the  affection of my new parents, brothers, sisters, and friends.
 I was  exceedingly familiar and friendly with them, always appearing as  chearful and satisfied as possible, and they put great confidence in me.
  I often went a hunting with them, and frequently gained their applause  for my activity at our shooting-matches.
 I was careful not to exceed  many of them in shooting; for no people are more envious than they in  this sport.
 I could observe, in their countenances and gestures, the  greatest expressions of joy when they exceeded me; and, when the reverse  happened, of envy.
 The Shawanese king took great notice of me,  and treated me with profound respect, and entire friendship, often  entrusting me to hunt at my liberty.
 I frequently returned with the  spoils of the woods, and as often presented some of what I had taken  to him, expressive of duty to my sovereign.
 My food and lodging was, in  common, with them, not so good indeed as I could desire, but necessity  made every thing acceptable.
    I now began to meditate an escape, and carefully avoided their  suspicions, continuing with them at Old Chelicothe until the first day  of June following, and then was taken by them to the salt springs on  Sciotha, and kept there, making salt, ten days.
 During this time I  hunted some for them, and found the land, for a great extent about this  river, to exceed the soil of Kentucke, if possible, and remarkably well  watered.
    When I returned to Chelicothe, alarmed to see four hundred and fifty  Indians, of their choicest warriors, painted and armed in a fearful  manner, ready to march against Boonsborough, I determined to escape the  first opportunity.
    On the sixteenth, before sun-rise, I departed in the most secret manner,  and arrived at Boonsborough on the twentieth, after a journey of one  hundred and sixty miles; during which, I had but one meal.
    I found our fortress in a bad state of defence, but we proceeded  immediately to repair our flanks, strengthen our gates and posterns, and  form double bastions, which we compleated in ten days.
 In this time we  daily expected the arrival of the Indian army; and at length, one of  my fellow prisoners, escaping from them, arrived, informing us that the  enemy had an account of my departure, and postponed their expedition  three weeks.
--The Indians had spies out viewing our movements, and were  greatly alarmed with our increase in number and fortifications.
 The  Grand Councils of the nations were held frequently, and with more  deliberation than usual.
 They evidently saw the approaching hour when  the Long Knife would disposess them of their desirable habitations; and  anxiously concerned for futurity, determined utterly to extirpate the  whites out of Kentucke.
 We were not intimidated by their movements, but  frequently gave them proofs of our courage.
    About the first of August, I made an incursion into the Indian country,  with a party of nineteen men, in order to surprise a small town up  Sciotha, called Paint-Creek-Town.
 We advanced within four miles  thereof, where we met a party of thirty Indians, on their march against  Boonsborough, intending to join the others from Chelicothe.
 A smart  fight ensued betwixt us for some time: At length the savages gave way,  and fled.
 We had no loss on our side: The enemy had one killed, and  two wounded.
 We took from them three horses, and all their baggage; and  being informed, by two of our number that went to their town, that the  Indians had entirely evacuated it, we proceeded no further, and returned  with all possible expedition to assist our garrison against the other  party.
 We passed by them on the sixth day, and on the seventh, we  arrived safe at Boonsborough.
    On the eighth, the Indian army arrived, being four hundred and  forty-four in number, commanded by Capt.
 Duquesne, eleven other  Frenchmen, and some of their own chiefs, and marched up within view  of our fort, with British and French colours flying; and having sent a  summons to me, in his Britannick Majesty's name, to surrender the fort,  I requested two days consideration, which was granted.
    It was now a critical period with us.
--We were a small number in the  garrison.
--A powerful army before our walls, whose appearance proclaimed  inevitable death, fearfully painted, and marking their footsteps with  desolation.
 Death was preferable to captivity; and if taken by storm,  we must inevitably be devoted to destruction.
 In this situation  we concluded to maintain our garrison, if possible.
 We immediately  proceeded to collect what we could of our horses, and other cattle, and  bring them through the posterns into the fort: And in the evening of  the ninth, I returned answer, that we were determined to defend our  fort while a man was living--Now, said I to their commander, who stood  attentively hearing my sentiments, We laugh at all your formidable  preparations: But thank you for giving us notice and time to provide for  our defence.
 Your efforts will not prevail; for our gates shall for ever  deny you admittance.
--Whether this answer affected their courage, or  not, I cannot tell; but, contrary to our expectations, they formed  a scheme to deceive us, declaring it was their orders, from Governor  Hamilton, to take us captives, and not to destroy us; but if nine of  us would come out, and treat with them, they would immediatly withdraw  their forces from our walls, and return home peaceably.
 This sounded  grateful in our ears; and we agreed to the proposal.
    We held the treaty within sixty yards of the garrison, on purpose to  divert them from a breach of honour, as we could not avoid suspicions of  the savages.
 In this situation the articles were formally agreed to,  and signed; and the Indians told us it was customary with them, on such  occasions, for two Indians to shake hands with every white-man in the  treaty, as an evidence of entire friendship.
 We agreed to this also,  but were soon convinced their policy was to take us prisoners.
--They  immediately grappled us; but, although surrounded by hundreds of  savages, we extricated ourselves from them, and escaped all safe into  the garrison, except one that was wounded, through a heavy fire from  their army.
 They immediately attacked us on every side, and a constant  heavy fire ensued between us day and night for the space of nine days.
    In this time the enemy began to undermine our fort, which was situated  sixty yards from Kentucke river.
 They began at the water-mark and  proceeded in the bank some distance, which we understood by their  making the water muddy with the clay; and we immediately proceeded to  disappoint their design, by cutting a trench across their subterranean  passage.
 The enemy discovering our counter-mine, by the clay we threw  out of the fort, desisted from that stratagem: And experience now fully  convincing them that neither their power nor policy could effect their  purpose, on the twentieth day of August they raised the siege, and  departed.
    During this dreadful siege, which threatened death in every form, we had  two men killed, and four wounded, besides a number of cattle.
 We killed  of the enemy thirty-seven, and wounded a great number.
 After they were  gone, we picked up one hundred and twenty-five pounds weight of bullets,  besides what stuck in the logs of our fort; which certainly is a great  proof of their industry.
 Soon after this, I went into the settlement,  and nothing worthy of a place in this account passed in my affairs for  some time.
    During my absence from Kentucke, Col.
 Bowman carried on an expedition  against the Shawanese, at Old Chelicothe, with one hundred and sixty  men, in July, 1779.
 Here they arrived undiscovered, and a battle ensued,  which lasted until ten o'clock, A.
 M.
 when Col.
 Bowman, finding he could  not succeed at this time, retreated about thirty miles.
 The Indians,  in the meantime, collecting all their forces, pursued and overtook him,  when a smart fight continued near two hours, not to the advantage of  Col.
 Bowman's party.
    Col.
 Harrod proposed to mount a number of horse, and furiously to rush  upon the savages, who at this time fought with remarkable fury.
 This  desperate step had a happy effect, broke their line of battle, and the  savages fled on all sides.
 In these two battles we had nine killed, and  one wounded.
 The enemy's loss uncertain, only two scalps being taken.
    On the twenty-second day of June, 1780, a large party of Indians and  Canadians, about six hundred in number, commanded by Col.
 Bird, attacked  Riddle's and Martin's stations, at the Forks of Licking River, with six  pieces of artillery.
 They carried this expedition so secretly, that  the unwary inhabitants did not discover them, until they fired upon the  forts; and, not being prepared to oppose them, were obliged to surrender  themselves miserable captives to barbarous savages, who immediately  after tomahawked one man and two women, and loaded all the others with  heavy baggage, forcing them along toward their towns, able or unable  to march.
 Such as were weak and faint by the way, they tomahawked.
 The  tender women, and helpless children, fell victims to their cruelty.
  This, and the savage treatment they received afterwards, is shocking to  humanity, and too barbarous to relate.
    The hostile disposition of the savages, and their allies, caused General  Clark, the commandant at the Falls of the Ohio, immediately to begin an  expedition with his own regiment, and the armed force of the country,  against Pecaway, the principal town of the Shawanese, on a branch  of Great Miami, which he finished with great success, took seventeen  scalps, and burnt the town to ashes, with the loss of seventeen men.
    About this time I returned to Kentucke with my family; and here, to  avoid an enquiry into my conduct, the reader being before informed of  my bringing my family to Kentucke, I am under the necessity of informing  him that, during my captivity with the Indians, my wife, who despaired  of ever seeing me again, expecting the Indians had put a period to my  life, oppressed with the distresses of the country, and bereaved of me,  her only happiness, had, before I returned, transported my family and  goods, on horses, through the wilderness, amidst a multitude of dangers,  to her father's house, in North-Carolina.
    Shortly after the troubles at Boonsborough, I went to them, and lived  peaceably there until this time.
 The history of my going home, and  returning with my family, forms a series of difficulties, an account  of which would swell a volume, and being foreign to my purpose, I shall  purposely omit them.
    I settled my family in Boonsborough once more; and shortly after, on  the sixth day of October, 1780, I went in company with my brother to the  Blue Licks; and, on our return home, we were fired upon by a party of  Indians.
 They shot him, and pursued me, by the scent of their dog, three  miles; but I killed the dog, and escaped.
 The winter soon came on, and  was very severe, which confined the Indians to their wigwams.
    The severity of this Winter caused great difficulties in Kentucke.
 The  enemy had destroyed most of the corn, the Summer before.
 This necessary  article was scarce, and dear; and the inhabitants lived chiefly on the  flesh of buffaloes.
 The circumstances of many were very lamentable:  However, being a hardy race of people, and accustomed to difficulties  and necessities, they were wonderfully supported through all their  sufferings, until the ensuing Fall, when we received abundance from the  fertile soil.
    Towards Spring, we were frequently harassed by Indians; and, in May,  1782, a party assaulted Ashton's station, killed one man, and took  a Negro prisoner.
 Capt.
 Ashton, with twenty-five men, pursued, and  overtook the savages, and a smart fight ensued, which lasted two hours;  but they being superior in number, obliged Captain Ashton's party to  retreat, with the loss of eight killed, and four mortally wounded; their  brave commander himself being numbered among the dead.
    The Indians continued their hostilities; and, about the tenth of August  following, two boys were taken from Major Hoy's station.
 This party was  pursued by Capt.
 Holder and seventeen men, who were also defeated, with  the loss of four men killed, and one wounded.
 Our affairs became more  and more alarming.
 Several stations which had lately been erected in the  country were continually infested with savages, stealing their horses  and killing the men at every opportunity.
 In a field, near Lexington, an  Indian shot a man, and running to scalp him, was himself shot from the  fort, and fell dead upon his enemy.
    Every day we experienced recent mischiefs.
 The barbarous savage nations  of Shawanese, Cherokees, Wyandots, Tawas, Delawares, and several others  near Detroit, united in a war against us, and assembled their choicest  warriors at old Chelicothe, to go on the expedition, in order to  destroy us, and entirely depopulate the country.
 Their savage minds were  inflamed to mischief by two abandoned men, Captains McKee and Girty.
  These led them to execute every diabolical scheme; and, on the fifteenth  day of August, commanded a party of Indians and Canadians, of about five  hundred in number, against Briant's station, five miles from Lexington.
  Without demanding a surrender, they furiously assaulted the garrison,  which was happily prepared to oppose them; and, after they had expended  much ammunition in vain, and killed the cattle round the fort, not being  likely to make themselves masters of this place, they raised the siege,  and departed in the morning of the third day after they came, with the  loss of about thirty killed, and the number of wounded uncertain.
--Of  the garrison four were killed, and three wounded.
    On the eighteenth day Col.
 Todd, Col.
 Trigg, Major Harland, and myself,  speedily collected one hundred and seventy-six men, well armed, and  pursued the savages.
 They had marched beyond the Blue Licks to a  remarkable bend of the main fork of Licking River, about forty-three  miles from Lexington, as it is particularly represented in the map,  where we overtook them on the nineteenth day.
 The savages observing us,  gave way; and we, being ignorant of their numbers, passed the river.
  When the enemy saw our proceedings, having greatly the advantage of us  in situation, they formed the line of battle, represented in the map,  from one bend of Licking to the other, about a mile from the Blue Licks.
  An exceeding fierce battle immediately began, for about fifteen minutes,  when we, being over-powered by numbers, were obliged to retreat, with  the loss of sixty-seven men; seven of whom were taken prisoners.
 The  brave and much lamented Colonels Todd and Trigg, Major Harland and my  second son, were among the dead.
 We were informed that the Indians,  numbering their dead, found they had four killed more than we; and  therefore, four of the prisoners they had taken, were, by general  consent, ordered to be killed, in a most barbarous manner, by the young  warriors, in order to train them up to cruelty; and then they proceeded  to their towns.
    On our retreat we were met by Col.
 Logan, hastening to join us, with  a number of well armed men: This powerful assistance we unfortunately  wanted in the battle; for, notwithstanding the enemy's superiority of  numbers, they acknowledged that, if they had received one more fire from  us, they should undoubtedly have given way.
 So valiantly did our small  party fight, that, to the memory of those who unfortunately fell in the  battle, enough of honour cannot be paid.
 Had Col.
 Logan and his party  been with us, it is highly probable we should have given the savages a  total defeat.
    I cannot reflect upon this dreadful scene, but sorrow fills my heart.
 A  zeal for the defence of their country led these heroes to the scene of  action, though with a few men to attack a powerful army of experienced  warriors.
 When we gave way, they pursued us with the utmost eagerness,  and in every quarter spread destruction.
 The river was difficult to  cross, and many were killed in the flight, some just entering the river,  some in the water, others after crossing in ascending the cliffs.
 Some  escaped on horse-back, a few on foot; and, being dispersed every where,  in a few hours, brought the melancholy news of this unfortunate battle  to Lexington.
 Many widows were now made.
 The reader may guess what  sorrow filled the hearts of the inhabitants, exceeding any thing that I  am able to describe.
 Being reinforced, we returned to bury the dead, and  found their bodies strewed every where, cut and mangled in a dreadful  manner.
 This mournful scene exhibited a horror almost unparalleled: Some  torn and eaten by wild beasts; those in the river eaten by fishes; all  in such a putrified condition, that no one could be distinguished from  another.
    As soon as General Clark, then at the Falls of the Ohio, who was  ever our ready friend, and merits the love and gratitude of all his  country-men, understood the circumstances of this unfortunate action, he  ordered an expedition, with all possible haste, to pursue the savages,  which was so expeditiously effected, that we overtook them within two  miles of their towns, and probably might have obtained a great victory,  had not two of their number met us about two hundred poles before we  come up.
 These returned quick as lightening to their camp with the  alarming news of a mighty army in view.
 The savages fled in the utmost  disorder, evacuated their towns, and reluctantly left their territory  to our mercy.
 We immediately took possession of Old Chelicothe without  opposition, being deserted by its inhabitants.
 We continued our pursuit  through five towns on the Miami rivers, Old Chelicothe, Pecaway, New  Chelicothe, Will's Towns, and Chelicothe, burnt them all to ashes,  entirely destroyed their corn, and other fruits, and every where spread  a scene of desolation in the country.
 In this expedition we took seven  prisoners and five scalps, with the loss of only four men, two of whom  were accidentally killed by our own army.
    This campaign in some measure damped the spirits of the Indians, and  made them sensible of our superiority.
 Their connections were dissolved,  their armies scattered, and a future invasion put entirely out of  their power; yet they continued to practise mischief secretly upon the  inhabitants, in the exposed parts of the country.
    In October following, a party made an excursion into that district  called the Crab Orchard, and one of them, being advanced some distance  before the others, boldly entered the house of a poor defenceless  family, in which was only a Negro man, a woman and her children,  terrified with the apprehensions of immediate death.
 The savage,  perceiving their defenceless situation, without offering violence to  the family attempted to captivate the Negro, who, happily proved an  over-match for him, threw him on the ground, and, in the struggle, the  mother of the children drew an ax from a corner of the cottage, and  cut his head off, while her little daughter shut the door.
 The savages  instantly appeared, and applied their tomahawks to the door.
 An old  rusty gun-barrel, without a lock, lay in a corner, which the mother put  through a small crevice, and the savages, perceiving it, fled.
 In the  mean time, the alarm spread through the neighbourhood; the armed men  collected immediately, and pursued the ravagers into the wilderness.
  Thus Providence, by the means of this Negro, saved the whole of the poor  family from destruction.
 From that time, until the happy return of  peace between the United States and Great-Britain, the Indians did us  no mischief.
 Finding the great king beyond the water disappointed in  his expectations, and conscious of the importance of the Long Knife, and  their own wretchedness, some of the nations immediately desired peace;  to which, at present, they seem universally disposed, and are sending  ambassadors to General Clark, at the Falls of the Ohio, with the minutes  of their Councils, a specimen of which, in the minutes of the Piankashaw  Council, is subjoined.
    To conclude, I can now say that I have verified the saying of an old  Indian who signed Col.
 Henderson's deed.
 Taking me by the hand, at the  delivery thereof, Brother, says he, we have given you a fine land, but  I believe you will have much trouble in settling it.
--My footsteps have  often been marked with blood, and therefore I can truly subscribe to its  original name.
 Two darling sons, and a brother, have I lost by savage  hands, which have also taken from me forty valuable horses, and  abundance of cattle.
 Many dark and sleepless nights have I been a  companion for owls, separated from the chearful society of men, scorched  by the Summer's sun, and pinched by the Winter's cold, an instrument  ordained to settle the wilderness.
 But now the scene is changed: Peace  crowns the sylvan shade.
      What thanks, what ardent and ceaseless thanks are due to that  all-superintending Providence which has turned a cruel war into peace,  brought order out of confusion, made the fierce savages placid, and  turned away their hostile weapons from our country! May the same  Almighty Goodness banish the accursed monster, war, from all lands,  with her hated associates, rapine and insatiable ambition.
 Let peace,  descending from her native heaven, bid her olives spring amidst the  joyful nations; and plenty, in league with commerce, scatter blessings  from her copious hand.
    This account of my adventures will inform the reader of the most  remarkable events of this country.
--I now live in peace and safety,  enjoying the sweets of liberty, and the bounties of Providence, with  my once fellow-sufferers, in this delightful country, which I have seen  purchased with a vast expence of blood and treasure, delighting in the  prospect of its being, in a short time, one of the most opulent and  powerful states on the continent of North America; which, with the love  and gratitude of my country-men, I esteem a sufficient reward for all my  toil and dangers.

 THE PANEL OF LIGHT    The lids of the girl's eyes lifted slowly, and she stared at the panel  of light in the wall.
 Just at the outset, the act of seeing made not the  least impression on her numbed brain.
 For a long time she continued to  regard the dim illumination in the wall with the same passive fixity  of gaze.
 Apathy still lay upon her crushed spirit.
 In a vague way, she  realized her own inertness, and rested in it gratefully, subtly fearful  lest she again arouse to the full horror of her plight.
 In a curious  subconscious fashion, she was striving to hold on to this deadness  of sensation, thus to win a little respite from the torture that had  exhausted her soul.
    Of a sudden, her eyes noted the black lines that lay across the panel  of light.
 And, in that instant, her spirit was quickened once again.
 The  clouds lifted from her brain.
 Vision was clear now.
 Understanding seized  the full import of this hideous thing on which she looked.
.
.
.
 For the  panel of light was a window, set high within a wall of stone.
 The rigid  lines of black that crossed it were bars--prison bars.
 It was still  true, then: She was in a cell of the Tombs.
    The girl, crouching miserably on the narrow bed, maintained her fixed  watching of the window--that window which was a symbol of her utter  despair.
 Again, agony wrenched within her.
 She did not weep: long ago  she had exhausted the relief of tears.
 She did not pace to and fro in  the comfort of physical movement with which the caged beast finds a  mocking imitation of liberty: long ago, her physical vigors had been  drained under stress of anguish.
 Now, she was well-nigh incapable of any  bodily activity.
 There came not even so much as the feeblest moan from  her lips.
 The torment was far too racking for such futile fashion of  lamentation.
 She merely sat there in a posture of collapse.
 To all  outward seeming, nerveless, emotionless, an abject creature.
 Even  the eyes, which held so fixedly their gaze on the window, were quite  expressionless.
 Over them lay a film, like that which veils the eyes of  some dead thing.
 Only an occasional languid motion of the lids revealed  the life that remained.
    So still the body.
 Within the soul, fury raged uncontrolled.
 For all the  desolate calm of outer seeming, the tragedy of her fate was being acted  with frightful vividness there in memory.
 In that dreadful remembrance,  her spirit was rent asunder anew by realization of that which had become  her portion.
.
.
.
 It was then, as once again the horrible injustice of her  fate racked consciousness with its tortures, that the seeds of revolt  were implanted in her heart.
 The thought of revenge gave to her the  first meager gleam of comfort that had lightened her moods through many  miserable days and nights.
 Those seeds of revolt were to be nourished  well, were to grow into their flower--a poison flower, developed through  the three years of convict life to which the judge had sentenced her.
    The girl was appalled by the mercilessness of a destiny that had so  outraged right.
 She was wholly innocent of having done any wrong.
 She  had struggled through years of privation to keep herself clean and  wholesome, worthy of those gentlefolk from whom she drew her blood.
  And earnest effort had ended at last under an overwhelming  accusation--false, yet none the less fatal to her.
 This accusation,  after soul-wearying delays, had culminated to-day in conviction.
 The  sentence of the court had been imposed upon her: that for three years  she should be imprisoned.
.
.
.
 This, despite her innocence.
 She had  endured much--miserably much!--for honesty's sake.
 There wrought the  irony of fate.
 She had endured bravely for honesty's sake.
 And the end  of it all was shame unutterable.
 There was nought left her save a wild  dream of revenge against the world that had martyrized her.
 "Vengeance  is mine.
 I will repay, saith the Lord.
".
.
.
 The admonition could not  touch her now.
 Why should she care for the decrees of a God who had  abandoned her!    There had been nothing in the life of Mary Turner, before the  catastrophe came, to distinguish it from many another.
 Its most  significant details were of a sordid kind, familiar to poverty.
 Her  father had been an unsuccessful man, as success is esteemed by this  generation of Mammon-worshipers.
 He was a gentleman, but the trivial  fact is of small avail to-day.
 He was of good birth, and he was the  possessor of an inherited competence.
 He had, as well, intelligence, but  it was not of a financial sort.
    So, little by little, his fortune became shrunken toward nothingness,  by reason of injudicious investments.
 He married a charming woman, who,  after a brief period of wedded happiness, gave her life to the birth  of the single child of the union, Mary.
 Afterward, in his distress over  this loss, Ray Turner seemed even more incompetent for the management of  business affairs.
 As the years passed, the daughter grew toward maturity  in an experience of ever-increasing penury.
 Nevertheless, there was no  actual want of the necessities of life, though always a woful lack of  its elegancies.
 The girl was in the high-school, when her father finally  gave over his rather feeble effort of living.
 Between parent and child,  the intimacy had been unusually close.
 At his death, the father left her  a character well instructed in the excellent principles that had been  his own.
 That was his sole legacy to her.
 Of worldly goods, not the  value of a pin.
    Yet, measured according to the stern standards of adversity, Mary was  fortunate.
 Almost at once, she procured a humble employment in the  Emporium, the great department store owned by Edward Gilder.
 To be  sure, the wage was infinitesimal, while the toil was body-breaking  soul-breaking.
 Still, the pittance could be made to sustain life, and  Mary was blessed with both soul and body to sustain much.
 So she merged  herself in the army of workers--in the vast battalion of those that give  their entire selves to a labor most stern and unremitting, and most ill  rewarded.
    Mary, nevertheless, avoided the worst perils of her lot.
 She did not  flinch under privation, but went her way through it, if not serenely, at  least without ever a thought of yielding to those temptations that beset  a girl who is at once poor and charming.
 Fortunately for her, those  in closest authority over her were not so deeply smitten as to make  obligatory on her a choice between complaisance and loss of position.
  She knew of situations like that, the cul-de-sac of chastity, worse  than any devised by a Javert.
 In the store, such things were matters of  course.
 There is little innocence for the girl in the modern city.
  There can be none for the worker thrown into the storm-center of a great  commercial activity, humming with vicious gossip, all alive with  quips from the worldly wise.
 At the very outset of her employment, the  sixteen-year-old girl learned that she might eke out the six dollars  weekly by trading on her personal attractiveness to those of the  opposite sex.
 The idea was repugnant to her; not only from the maidenly  instinct of purity, but also from the moral principles woven into her  character by the teachings of a father wise in most things, though a  fool in finance.
 Thus, she remained unsmirched, though well informed as  to the verities of life.
 She preferred purity and penury, rather than a  slight pampering of the body to be bought by its degradation.
 Among her  fellows were some like herself; others, unlike.
 Of her own sort, in this  single particular, were the two girls with whom she shared a cheap room.
  Their common decency in attitude toward the other sex was the unique  bond of union.
 In their association, she found no real companionship.
  Nevertheless, they were wholesome enough.
 Otherwise they were  illiterate, altogether uncongenial.
    In such wise, through five dreary years, Mary Turner lived.
 Nine hours  daily, she stood behind a counter.
 She spent her other waking hours  in obligatory menial labors: cooking her own scant meals over the gas;  washing and ironing, for the sake of that neat appearance which was  required of her by those in authority at the Emporium--yet, more  especially, necessary for her own self-respect.
 With a mind keen and  earnest, she contrived some solace from reading and studying, since  the free library gave her this opportunity.
 So, though engaged in  stultifying occupation through most of her hours, she was able to find  food for mental growth.
 Even, in the last year, she had reached a point  of development whereat she began to study seriously her own position in  the world's economy, to meditate on a method of bettering it.
 Under this  impulse, hope mounted high in her heart.
 Ambition was born.
 By candid  comparison of herself with others about her, she realized the fact that  she possessed an intelligence beyond the average.
 The training by her  father, too, had been of a superior kind.
 There was as well, at the back  vaguely, the feeling of particular self-respect that belongs inevitably  to the possessor of good blood.
 Finally, she demurely enjoyed a modest  appreciation of her own physical advantages.
 In short, she had  beauty, brains and breeding.
 Three things of chief importance to any  woman--though there be many minds as to which may be chief among the  three.
    I have said nothing specific thus far as to the outer being of Mary  Turner--except as to filmed eyes and a huddled form.
 But, in a happier  situation, the girl were winning enough.
 Indeed, more! She was one of  those that possess an harmonious beauty, with, too, the penetrant charm  that springs from the mind, with the added graces born of the spirit.
  Just now, as she sat, a figure of desolation, there on the bed in  the Tombs cell, it would have required a most analytical observer to  determine the actualities of her loveliness.
 Her form was disguised by  the droop of exhaustion.
 Her complexion showed the pallor of sorrowful  vigils.
 Her face was no more than a mask of misery.
 Yet, the shrewd  observer, if a lover of beauty, might have found much for delight, even  despite the concealment imposed by her present condition.
 Thus, the  stormy glory of her dark hair, great masses that ran a riot of shining  ripples and waves.
 And the straight line of the nose, not too thin, yet  fine enough for the rapture of a Praxiteles.
 And the pink daintiness of  the ear-tips, which peered warmly from beneath the pall of tresses.
 One  could know nothing accurately of the complexion now.
 But it were easy to  guess that in happier places it would show of a purity to entice, with a  gentle blooming of roses in the cheeks.
 Even in this hour of unmitigated  evil, the lips revealed a curving beauty of red--not quite crimson,  though near enough for the word; not quite scarlet either; only, a red  gently enchanting, which turned one's thoughts toward tenderness--with  a hint of desire.
 It was, too, a generous mouth, not too large; still,  happily, not so small as those modeled by Watteau.
 It was  altogether winsome--more, it was generous and true, desirable for  kisses--yes!--more desirable for strength and for faith.
    Like every intelligent woman, Mary had taken the trouble to reinforce  the worth of her physical attractiveness.
 The instinct of sex was  strong in her, as it must be in every normal woman, since that appeal is  nature's law.
 She kept herself supple and svelte by many exercises, at  which her companions in the chamber scoffed, with the prudent warning  that more work must mean more appetite.
 With arms still aching from  the lifting of heavy bolts of cloth to and fro from the shelves, she  nevertheless was at pains nightly to brush with the appointed two  hundred strokes the thick masses of her hair.
 Even here, in the sordid  desolation of the cell, the lustrous sheen witnessed the fidelity of  her care.
 So, in each detail of her, the keen observer might have found  adequate reason for admiration.
 There was the delicacy of the hands,  with fingers tapering, with nails perfectly shaped, neither too dull  nor too shining.
 And there were, too, finally, the trimly shod feet, set  rather primly on the floor, small, and arched like those of a Spanish  Infanta.
 In truth, Mary Turner showed the possibilities at least, if not  just now the realities, of a very beautiful woman.
    Naturally, in this period of grief, the girl's mind had no concern with  such external merits over which once she had modestly exulted.
 All  her present energies were set to precise recollection of the ghastly  experience into which she had been thrust.
    In its outline, the event had been tragically simple.
    There had been thefts in the store.
 They had been traced eventually to a  certain department, that in which Mary worked.
 The detective was alert.
  Some valuable silks were missed.
 Search followed immediately.
 The goods  were found in Mary's locker.
 That was enough.
 She was charged with the  theft.
 She protested innocence--only to be laughed at in derision by  her accusers.
 Every thief declares innocence.
 Mr. Gilder himself was  emphatic against her.
 The thieving had been long continued.
 An example  must be made.
 The girl was arrested.
    The crowded condition of the court calendar kept her for three months in  the Tombs, awaiting trial.
 She was quite friendless.
 To the world, she  was only a thief in duress.
 At the last, the trial was very short.
 Her  lawyer was merely an unfledged practitioner assigned to her defense as  a formality of the court.
 This novice in his profession was so grateful  for the first recognition ever afforded him that he rather assisted than  otherwise the District Attorney in the prosecution of the case.
    At the end, twelve good men and true rendered a verdict of guilty  against the shuddering girl in the prisoner's dock.
    So simple the history of Mary Turner's trial.
.
.
.
 The sentence of the  judge was lenient--only three years!        .
 A CHEERFUL PRODIGAL.
    That which was the supreme tragedy to the broken girl in the cell merely  afforded rather agreeable entertainment to her former fellows of the  department store.
 Mary Turner throughout her term of service there had  been without real intimates, so that now none was ready to mourn over  her fate.
 Even the two room-mates had felt some slight offense, since  they sensed the superiority of her, though vaguely.
 Now, they found  a smug satisfaction in the fact of her disaster as emphasizing very  pleasurably their own continuance in respectability.
    As many a philosopher has observed, we secretly enjoy the misfortunes of  others, particularly of our friends, since they are closest to us.
 Most  persons hasten to deny this truth in its application to themselves.
 They  do so either because from lack of clear understanding they are not quite  honest with themselves, from lack of clear introspection, or because, as  may be more easily believed, they are not quite honest in the assertion.
  As a matter of fact, we do find a singular satisfaction in the troubles  of others.
 Contemplation of such suffering renders more striking the  contrasted well-being of our own lot.
 We need the pains of others  to serve as background for our joys--just as sin is essential as the  background for any appreciation of virtue, even any knowledge of its  existence.
.
.
.
 So now, on the day of Mary Turner's trial, there was a  subtle gaiety of gossipings to and fro through the store.
 The girl's  plight was like a shuttlecock driven hither and yon by the battledores  of many tongues.
 It was the first time in many years that one of the  employees had been thus accused of theft.
 Shoplifters were so common as  to be a stale topic.
 There was a refreshing novelty in this case,  where one of themselves was the culprit.
 Her fellow workers chatted  desultorily of her as they had opportunity, and complacently thanked  their gods that they were not as she--with reason.
 Perhaps, a very few  were kindly hearted enough to feel a touch of sympathy for this ruin of  a life.
    Of such was Smithson, a member of the executive staff, who did not  hesitate to speak his mind, though none too forcibly.
 As for that,  Smithson, while the possessor of a dignity nourished by years of  floor-walking, was not given to the holding of vigorous opinions.
 Yet,  his comment, meager as it was, stood wholly in Mary's favor.
 And he  spoke with a certain authority, since he had given official attention to  the girl.
    Smithson stopped Sarah Edwards, Mr. Gilder's private secretary, as she  was passing through one of the departments that morning, to ask her if  the owner had yet reached his office.
    "Been and gone," was the secretary's answer, with the terseness  characteristic of her.
    "Gone!" Smithson repeated, evidently somewhat disturbed by the  information.
 "I particularly wanted to see him.
"    "He'll be back, all right," Sarah vouchsafed, amiably.
 "He went  down-town, to the Court of General Sessions.
 The judge sent for him  about the Mary Turner case.
"    "Oh, yes, I remember now," Smithson exclaimed.
 Then he added, with a  trace of genuine feeling, "I hope the poor girl gets off.
 She was a nice  girl--quite the lady, you know, Miss Edwards.
"    "No, I don't know," Sarah rejoined, a bit tartly.
 Truth to tell, the  secretary was haunted by a grim suspicion that she herself was not quite  the lady of her dreams, and never would be able to acquire the graces of  the Vere De Vere.
 For Sarah, while a most efficient secretary, was not  in her person of that slender elegance which always characterized her  favorite heroines in the novels she affected.
 On the contrary, she was  of a sort to have gratified Byron, who declared that a woman in her  maturity should be plump.
 Now, she recalled with a twinge of envy that  the accused girl had been of an aristocratic slimness of form.
 "Oh, did  you know her?" she questioned, without any real interest.
    Smithson answered with that bland stateliness of manner which was the  fruit of floor-walking politeness.
    "Well, I couldn't exactly say I knew her, and yet I might say, after a  manner of speaking, that I did--to a certain extent.
 You see, they put  her in my department when she first came here to work.
 She was a good  saleswoman, as saleswomen go.
 For the matter of that," he added with a  sudden access of energy, "she was the last girl in the world I'd take  for a thief.
" He displayed some evidences of embarrassment over the  honest feeling into which he had been betrayed, and made haste to  recover his usual business manner, as he continued formally.
 "Will you  please let me know when Mr. Gilder arrives? There are one or two little  matters I wish to discuss with him.
"    "All right!" Sarah agreed briskly, and she hurried on toward the private  office.
    The secretary was barely seated at her desk when the violent opening of  the door startled her, and, as she looked up, a cheery voice cried out:    "Hello, Dad!"    At the same moment, a young man entered, with an air of care-free  assurance, his face radiant.
 But, as his glance went to the empty  arm-chair at the desk, he halted abruptly, and his expression changed to  one of disappointment.
    "Not here!" he grumbled.
 Then, once again the smile was on his lips  as his eyes fell on the secretary, who had now risen to her feet in a  flutter of excitement.
    "Why, Mr. Dick!" Sarah gasped.
    "Hello, Sadie!" came the genial salutation.
 The young man advanced and  shook hands with her warmly.
 "I'm home again.
 Where's Dad?"    Even as he asked the question, the quick sobering of his face bore  witness to his disappointment over not finding his father in the office.
  For such was the relationship of the owner of the department store to  this new arrival on the scene.
 And in the patent chagrin under which the  son now labored was to be found a certain indication of character not  to be disregarded.
 Unlike many a child, he really loved his father.
 The  death of the mother years before had left him without other opportunity  for affection in the home, since he had neither brother nor sister.
 He  loved his father with a depth of feeling that made between the two a  real camaraderie, despite great differences in temperament.
 In that  simple and sincere regard which he bore for his father, the boy revealed  a heart ready for love, willing to give of itself its best for the one  beloved.
 Beyond that, as yet, there was little to be said of him with  exactness.
 He was a spoiled child of fortune, if you wish to have it  so.
 Certainly, he was only a drone in the world's hive.
 Thus far, he  had enjoyed the good things of life, without ever doing aught to deserve  them by contributing in return--save by his smiles and his genial air of  happiness.
    In the twenty-three years of his life, every gift that money could  lavish had been his.
 If the sum total of benefit was small, at least  there remained the consoling fact that the harm was even less.
 Luxury  had not sapped the strength of him.
 He had not grown vicious, as have so  many of his fellows among the sons of the rich.
 Some instinct held him  aloof from the grosser vices.
 His were the trifling faults that had  their origin chiefly in the joy of life, which manifest occasionally in  riotous extravagancies, of a sort actually to harm none, however absurd  and useless they may be.
    So much one might see by a glance into the face.
 He was well groomed,  of course; healthy, all a-tingle with vitality.
 And in the clear eyes,  which avoided no man's gaze, nor sought any woman's unseemly, there  showed a soul untainted, not yet developed, not yet debased.
 Through all  his days, Dick Gilder had walked gladly, in the content that springs to  the call of one possessed of a capacity for enjoyment; possessed, too,  of every means for the gratification of desire.
 As yet, the man of him  was unrevealed in its integrity.
 No test had been put upon him.
 The  fires of suffering had not tried the dross of him.
 What real worth might  lie under this sunny surface the future must determine.
 There showed now  only this one significant fact: that, in the first moment of his return  from journeyings abroad, he sought his father with all eagerness, and  was sorely grieved because the meeting must still be delayed.
 It was a  little thing, perhaps.
 Yet, it was capable of meaning much concerning  the nature of the lad.
 It revealed surely a tender heart, one responsive  to a pure love.
 And to one of his class, there are many forces ever  present to atrophy such simple, wholesome power of loving.
 The ability  to love cleanly and absolutely is the supreme virtue.
    Sarah explained that Mr. Gilder had been called to the Court of General  Sessions by the judge.
    Dick interrupted her with a gust of laughter.
    "What's Dad been doing now?" he demanded, his eyes twinkling.
 Then,  a reminiscent grin shaped itself on his lips.
 "Remember the time that  fresh cop arrested him for speeding? Wasn't he wild? I thought he would  have the whole police force discharged.
" He smiled again.
 "The trouble  is," he declared sedately, "that sort of thing requires practice.
 Now,  when I'm arrested for speeding, I'm not in the least flustered--oh, not  a little bit! But poor Dad! That one experience of his almost soured his  whole life.
 It was near the death of him--also, of the city's finest.
"    By this time, the secretary had regained her usual poise, which had been  somewhat disturbed by the irruption of the young man.
 Her round face  shone delightedly as she regarded him.
 There was a maternal note of  rebuke in her voice as she spoke:    "Why, we didn't expect you back for two or three months yet.
"    Once again, Dick laughed, with an infectious gaiety that brought a smile  of response to the secretary's lips.
    "Sadie," he explained confidentially, "don't you dare ever to let the  old man know.
 He would be all swollen up.
 It's bad to let a parent swell  up.
 But the truth is, Sadie, I got kind of homesick for Dad--yes, just  that!" He spoke the words with a sort of shamefaced wonder.
 It is not  easy for an Anglo-Saxon to confess the realities of affection in  vital intimacies.
 He repeated the phrase in a curiously appreciative  hesitation, as one astounded by his own emotion.
 "Yes, homesick for  Dad!"    Then, to cover an excess of sincere feeling, he continued, with a burst  of laughter:    "Besides, Sadie, I was broke.
"    The secretary sniffed.
    "The cable would have handled that end of it, I guess," she said,  succinctly.
    There was no word of contradiction from Dick, who, from ample  experience, knew that any demand for funds would have received answer  from the father.
    "But what is Dad doing in court?" he demanded.
    Sarah explained the matter with her usual conciseness:    "One of the girls was arrested for stealing.
"    The nature of the son was shown then clearly in one of its best aspects.
  At once, he exhibited his instinct toward the quality of mercy, and,  too, his trust in the father whom he loved, by his eager comment.
    "And Dad went to court to get her out of the scrape.
 That's just like  the old man!"    Sarah, however, showed no hint of enthusiasm.
 Her mind was ever of the  prosaic sort, little prone to flights.
 In that prosaic quality, was to  be found the explanation of her dependability as a private secretary.
  So, now, she merely made a terse statement.
    "She was tried to-day, and convicted.
 The judge sent for Mr. Gilder to  come down this morning and have a talk with him about the sentence.
"    There was no lessening of the expression of certainty on the young man's  face.
 He loved his father, and he trusted where he loved.
    "It will be all right," he declared, in a tone of entire conviction.
  "Dad's heart is as big as a barrel.
 He'll get her off.
"    Then, of a sudden, Dick gave a violent start.
 He added a convincing  groan.
    "Oh, Lord!" he exclaimed, dismally.
 There was shame in his voice.
 "I  forgot all about it!"    The secretary regarded him with an expression of amazement.
    "All about what?" she questioned.
    Dick assumed an air vastly more confidential than at any time hitherto.
  He leaned toward the secretary's desk, and spoke with a new seriousness  of manner:    "Sadie, have you any money? I'm broker My taxi' has been waiting outside  all this time.
"    "Why, yes," the secretary said, cheerfully.
 "If you will----"    Dick was discreet enough to turn his attention to a picture on the  wall opposite while Sarah went through those acrobatic performances  obligatory on women who take no chances of losing money by carrying it  in purses.
    "There!" she called after a few panting seconds, and exhibited a flushed  face.
    Dick turned eagerly and seized the banknote offered him.
    "Mighty much obliged, Sadie," he said, enthusiastically.
 "But I must  run.
 Otherwise, this wouldn't be enough for the fare!" And, so saying,  he darted out of the room.
        .
 ONLY THREE YEARS.
    When, at last, the owner of the store entered the office, his face  showed extreme irritation.
 He did not vouchsafe any greeting to the  secretary, who regarded him with an accurate perception of his mood.
  With a diplomacy born of long experience, in her first speech Sarah  afforded an agreeable diversion to her employer's line of thought.
    "Mr. Hastings, of the Empire store, called you up, Mr. Gilder, and asked  me to let him know when you returned.
 Shall I get him on the wire?"    The man's face lightened instantly, and there was even the beginning of  a smile on his lips as he seated himself at the great mahogany desk.
    "Yes, yes!" he exclaimed, with evident enthusiasm.
 The smile grew in  the short interval before the connection was made.
 When, finally,  he addressed his friend over the telephone, his tones were of the  cheerfulest.
    "Oh, good morning.
 Yes, certainly.
 Four will suit me admirably.
.
.
.
  Sunday? Yes, if you like.
 We can go out after church, and have luncheon  at the country club.
" After listening a moment, he laughed in a pleased  fashion that had in it a suggestion of conscious superiority.
 "My dear  fellow," he declared briskly, "you couldn't beat me in a thousand years.
  Why, I made the eighteen holes in ninety-two only last week.
" He laughed  again at the answer over the wire, then hung up the receiver and pushed  the telephone aside, as he turned his attention to the papers neatly  arranged on the desk ready to his hand.
    The curiosity of the secretary could not be longer delayed.
    "What did they do with the Turner girl?" she inquired in an elaborately  casual manner.
    Gilder did not look up from the heap of papers, but answered rather  harshly, while once again his expression grew forbidding.
    "I don't know--I couldn't wait," he said.
 He made a petulant gesture as  he went on: "I don't see why Judge Lawlor bothered me about the matter.
  He is the one to impose sentence, not I.
 I am hours behind with my work  now.
"    For a few minutes he gave himself up to the routine of business,  distributing the correspondence and other various papers for the action  of subordinates, and speaking his orders occasionally to the attentive  secretary with a quickness and precision that proclaimed the capable  executive.
 The observer would have realized at once that here was a  man obviously fitted to the control of large affairs.
 The ability that  marches inevitably to success showed unmistakably in the face and form,  and in the fashion of speech.
 Edward Gilder was a big man physically,  plainly the possessor of that abundant vital energy which is a prime  requisite for achievement in the ordering of modern business concerns.
  Force was, indeed, the dominant quality of the man.
 His tall figure was  proportionately broad, and he was heavily fleshed.
 In fact, the body was  too ponderous.
 Perhaps, in that characteristic might be found a clue  to the chief fault in his nature.
 For he was ponderous, spiritually and  mentally, as well as materially.
 The fact was displayed suggestively in  the face, which was too heavy with its prominent jowls and aggressive  chin and rather bulbous nose.
 But there was nothing flabby anywhere.
  The ample features showed no trace of weakness, only a rude, abounding  strength.
 There was no lighter touch anywhere.
 Evidently a just man  according to his own ideas, yet never one to temper justice with mercy.
  He appeared, and was, a very practical and most prosaic business man.
 He  was not given to a humorous outlook on life.
 He took it and himself with  the utmost seriousness.
 He was almost entirely lacking in imagination,  that faculty which is essential to sympathy.
    "Take this," he directed presently, when he had disposed of the matters  before him.
 Forthwith, he dictated the following letter, and now his  voice took on a more unctuous note, as of one who is appreciative of his  own excellent generosity.
    "THE EDITOR,    "The New York Herald.
    "DEAR SIR: Inclosed please find my check for a thousand dollars for your  free-ice fund.
 It is going to be a very hard summer for the poor, and  I hope by thus starting the contributions for your fine charity at  this early day that you will be able to accomplish even more good than  usually.
    "Very truly yours.
"    He turned an inquiring glance toward Sarah.
    "That's what I usually give, isn't it?"    The secretary nodded energetically.
    "Yes," she agreed in her brisk manner, "that's what you have given every  year for the last ten years.
"    The statement impressed Gilder pleasantly.
 His voice was more mellow as  he made comment.
 His heavy face was radiant, and he smiled complacently.
    "Ten thousand dollars to this one charity alone!" he exclaimed.
 "Well,  it is pleasant to be able to help those less fortunate than ourselves.
"  He paused, evidently expectant of laudatory corroboration from the  secretary.
    But Sarah, though she could be tactful enough on occasion, did not  choose to meet her employer's anticipations just now.
 For that matter,  her intimate services permitted on her part some degree of familiarity  with the august head of the establishment.
 Besides, she did not stand in  awe of Gilder, as did the others in his service.
 No man is a hero to  his valet, or to his secretary.
 Intimate association is hostile to  hero-worship.
 So, now, Sarah spoke nonchalantly, to the indignation of  the philanthropist:    "Oh, yes, sir.
 Specially when you make so much that you don't miss it.
"    Gilder's thick gray brows drew down in a frown of displeasure, while his  eyes opened slightly in sheer surprise over the secretary's unexpected  remark.
 He hesitated for only an instant before replying with an air  of great dignity, in which was a distinct note of rebuke for the girl's  presumption.
    "The profits from my store are large, I admit, Sarah.
 But I neither  smuggle my goods, take rebates from railroads, conspire against small  competitors, nor do any of the dishonest acts that disgrace other  lines of business.
 So long as I make my profits honestly, I am honestly  entitled to them, no matter how big they are.
"    The secretary, being quite content with the havoc she had wrought in her  employer's complacency over his charitableness, nodded, and contented  herself with a demure assent to his outburst.
    "Yes, sir," she agreed, very meekly.
    Gilder stared at her for a few seconds, somewhat indignantly.
 Then,  he bethought himself of a subtle form of rebuke by emphasizing his  generosity.
    "Have the cashier send my usual five hundred to the Charities  Organization Society," he ordered.
 With this new evidence of his  generous virtue, the frown passed from his brows.
 If, for a fleeting  moment, doubt had assailed him under the spur of the secretary's words,  that doubt had now vanished under his habitual conviction as to his  sterling worth to the world at large.
    It was, therefore, with his accustomed blandness of manner that he  presently acknowledged the greeting of George Demarest, the chief of the  legal staff that looked after the firm's affairs.
 He was aware without  being told that the lawyer had called to acquaint him with the issue in  the trial of Mary Turner.
    "Well, Demarest?" he inquired, as the dapper attorney advanced into the  room at a rapid pace, and came to a halt facing the desk, after a lively  nod in the direction of the secretary.
    The lawyer's face sobered, and his tone as he answered was tinged with  constraint.
    "Judge Lawlor gave her three years," he replied, gravely.
 It was plain  from his manner that he did not altogether approve.
    But Gilder was unaffected by the attorney's lack of satisfaction over  the result.
 On the contrary, he smiled exultantly.
 His oritund voice  took on a deeper note, as he turned toward the secretary.
    "Good!" he exclaimed.
 "Take this, Sarah.
" And he continued, as the girl  opened her notebook and poised the pencil: "Be sure to have Smithson  post a copy of it conspicuously in all the girls' dressing-rooms, and in  the reading-room, and in the lunch-rooms, and in the assembly-room.
" He  cleared his throat ostentatiously and proceeded to the dictation of the  notice:    "Mary Turner, formerly employed in this store, was to-day sentenced to  prison for three years, having been convicted for the theft of goods  valued at over four hundred dollars.
 The management wishes again to  draw attention on the part of its employees to the fact that honesty is  always the best policy.
.
.
.
 Got that?"    "Yes, sir.
" The secretary's voice was mechanical, without any trace of  feeling.
 She was not minded to disturb her employer a second time this  morning by injudicious comment.
    "Take it to Smithson," Gilder continued, "and tell him that I wish him  to attend to its being posted according to my directions at once.
"    Again, the girl made her formal response in the affirmative, then left  the room.
    Gilder brought forth a box of cigars from a drawer of the desk, opened  it and thrust it toward the waiting lawyer, who, however, shook his  head in refusal, and continued to move about the room rather restlessly.
  Demarest paid no attention to the other's invitation to a seat, but the  courtesy was perfunctory on Gilder's part, and he hardly perceived  the perturbation of his caller, for he was occupied in selecting and  lighting a cigar with the care of a connoisseur.
 Finally, he spoke  again, and now there was an infinite contentment in the rich voice.
    "Three years--three years! That ought to be a warning to the rest of the  girls.
" He looked toward Demarest for acquiescence.
    The lawyer's brows were knit as he faced the proprietor of the store.
    "Funny thing, this case!" he ejaculated.
 "In some features, one of the  most unusual I have seen since I have been practicing law.
"    The smug contentment abode still on Gilder's face as he puffed in  leisurely ease on his cigar and uttered a trite condolence.
    "Very sad!--quite so! Very sad case, I call it.
" Demarest went on  speaking, with a show of feeling: "Most unusual case, in my estimation.
  You see, the girl keeps on declaring her innocence.
 That, of course, is  common enough in a way.
 But here, it's different.
 The point is, somehow,  she makes her protestations more convincing than they usually do.
 They  ring true, as it seems to me.
"    Gilder smiled tolerantly.
    "They didn't ring very true to the jury, it would seem," he retorted.
  And his voice was tart as he added: "Nor to the judge, since he deemed  it his duty to give her three years.
"    "Some persons are not very sensitive to impressions in such cases, I  admit," Demarest returned, coolly.
 If he meant any subtlety of allusion  to his hearer, it failed wholly to pierce the armor of complacency.
    "The stolen goods were found in her locker," Gilder declared in a  tone of finality.
 "Some of them, I have been given to understand, were  actually in the pocket of her coat.
"    "Well," the attorney said with a smile, "that sort of thing makes  good-enough circumstantial evidence, and without circumstantial evidence  there would be few convictions for crime.
 Yet, as a lawyer, I'm free to  admit that circumstantial evidence alone is never quite safe as proof of  guilt.
 Naturally, she says some one else must have put the stolen goods  there.
 As a matter of exact reasoning, that is quite within the measure  of possibility.
 That sort of thing has been done countless times.
"    Gilder sniffed indignantly.
    "And for what reason?" he demanded.
 "It's too absurd to think about.
"    "In similar cases," the lawyer answered, "those actually guilty of the  thefts have thus sought to throw suspicion on the innocent in order  to avoid it on themselves when the pursuit got too hot on their trail.
  Sometimes, too, such evidence has been manufactured merely to satisfy a  spite against the one unjustly accused.
"    "It's too absurd to think about," Gilder repeated, impatiently.
 "The  judge and the jury found no fault with the evidence.
"    Demarest realized that this advocacy in behalf of the girl was hardly  fitting on the part of the legal representative of the store she was  supposed to have robbed, so he abruptly changed his line of argument.
    "She says that her record of five years in your employ ought to count  something in her favor.
"    Gilder, however, was not disposed to be sympathetic as to a matter so  flagrantly opposed to his interests.
    "A court of justice has decreed her guilty," he asserted once again,  in his ponderous manner.
 His emphasis indicated that there the affair  ended.
    Demarest smiled cynically as he strode to and fro.
    "Nowadays," he shot out, "we don't call them courts of justice: we call  them courts of law.
"    Gilder yielded only a rather dubious smile over the quip.
 This much he  felt that he could afford, since those same courts served his personal  purposes well in deed.
    "Anyway," he declared, becoming genial again, "it's out of our hands.
  There's nothing we can do, now.
"    "Why, as to that," the lawyer replied, with a hint of hesitation, "I am  not so sure.
 You see, the fact of the matter is that, though I helped to  prosecute the case, I am not a little bit proud of the verdict.
"    Gilder raised his eyebrows in unfeigned astonishment.
 Even yet, he was  quite without appreciation of the attorney's feeling in reference to the  conduct of the case.
    "Why?" he questioned, sharply.
    "Because," the lawyer said, again halting directly before the desk, "in  spite of all the evidence against her, I am not sure that Mary Turner is  guilty--far from it, in fact!"    Gilder uttered an ejaculation of contempt, but Demarest went on  resolutely.
    "Anyhow," he explained, "the girl wants to see you, and I wish to urge  you to grant her an interview.
"    Gilder flared at this suggestion, and scowled wrathfully on the lawyer,  who, perhaps with professional prudence, had turned away in his rapid  pacing of the room.
    "What's the use?" Gilder stormed.
 A latent hardness revealed itself at  the prospect of such a visitation.
 And along with this hardness came  another singular revelation of the nature of the man.
 For there was  consternation in his voice, as he continued in vehement expostulation  against the idea.
 If there was harshness in his attitude there was,  too, a fugitive suggestion of tenderness alarmed over the prospect of  undergoing such an interview with a woman.
    "I can't have her crying all over the office and begging for mercy," he  protested, truculently.
 But a note of fear lay under the petulance.
    Demarest's answer was given with assurance,    "You are mistaken about that.
 The girl doesn't beg for mercy.
 In fact,  that's the whole point of the matter.
 She demands justice--strange as  that may seem, in a court of law!--and nothing else.
 The truth is, she's  a very unusual girl, a long way beyond the ordinary sales-girl, both in  brains and in education.
"    "The less reason, then, for her being a thief," Gilder grumbled in his  heaviest voice.
    "And perhaps the less reason for believing her to be a thief," the  lawyer retorted, suavely.
 He paused for a moment, then went on.
 There  was a tone of sincere determination in his voice.
 "Just before the judge  imposed sentence, he asked her if she had anything to say.
 You know,  it's just a usual form--a thing that rarely means much of anything.
  But this case was different, let me tell you.
 She surprised us all by  answering at once that she had.
 It's really a pity, Gilder, that you  didn't wait.
 Why, that poor girl made a--damn--fine speech!"    The lawyer's forensic aspirations showed in his honest appreciation of  the effectiveness of such oratory from the heart as he had heard in the  courtroom that day.
    "Pooh! pooh!" came the querulous objection.
 "She seems to have  hypnotized you.
" Then, as a new thought came to the magnate, he spoke  with a trace of anxiety.
 There were always the reporters, looking for  space to fill with foolish vaporings.
    "Did she say anything against me, or the store?"    "Not a word," the lawyer replied, gravely.
 His smile of appreciation was  discreetly secret.
 "She merely told us how her father died when she was  sixteen years old.
 She was compelled after that to earn her own living.
  Then she told how she had worked for you for five years steadily,  without there ever being a single thing against her.
 She said, too, that  she had never seen the things found in her locker.
 And she said more  than that! She asked the judge if he himself understood what it means  for a girl to be sentenced to prison for something she hadn't done.
  Somehow, Gilder, the way she talked had its effect on everybody in the  courtroom.
 I know! It's my business to understand things like that.
 And  what she said rang true.
 What she said, and the way she said it,  take brains and courage.
 The ordinary crook has neither.
 So, I had a  suspicion that she might be speaking the truth.
 You see, Gilder, it all  rang true! And it's my business to know how things ring in that  way.
" There was a little pause, while the lawyer moved back and forth  nervously.
 Then, he added: "I believe Lawlor would have suspended  sentence if it hadn't been for your talk with him.
"    There were not wanting signs that Gilder was impressed.
 But the gentler  fibers of the man were atrophied by the habits of a lifetime.
 What heart  he had once possessed had been buried in the grave of his young wife, to  be resurrected only for his son.
 In most things, he was consistently a  hard man.
 Since he had no imagination, he could have no real sympathy.
    He whirled about in his swivel chair, and blew a cloud of smoke from his  mouth.
 When he spoke, his voice was deeply resonant.
    "I simply did my duty," he said.
 "You are aware that I did not seek  any consultation with Judge Lawlor.
 He sent for me, and asked me what I  thought about the case--whether I thought it would be right to let the  girl go on a suspended sentence.
 I told him frankly that I believed that  an example should be made of her, for the sake of others who might be  tempted to steal.
 Property has some rights, Demarest, although it seems  to be getting nowadays so that anybody is likely to deny it.
" Then the  fretful, half-alarmed note sounded in his voice again, as he continued:  "I can't understand why the girl wants to see me.
"    The lawyer smiled dryly, since he had his back turned at the moment.
    "Why," he vouchsafed, "she just said that, if you would see her for ten  minutes, she would tell you how to stop the thefts in this store.
"    Gilder displayed signs of triumph.
 He brought his chair to a level and  pounded the desk with a weighty fist.
    "There!" he cried.
 "I knew it.
 The girl wants to confess.
 Well, it's  the first sign of decent feeling she's shown.
 I suppose it ought to be  encouraged.
 Probably there have been others mixed up in this.
"    Demarest attempted no denial.
    "Perhaps," he admitted, though he spoke altogether without conviction.
  "But," he continued insinuatingly, "at least it can do no harm if you  see her.
 I thought you would be willing, so I spoke to the District  Attorney, and he has given orders to bring her here for a few minutes on  the way to the Grand Central Station.
 They're taking her up to Burnsing,  you know.
 I wish, Gilder, you would have a little talk with her.
 No harm  in that!" With the saying, the lawyer abruptly went out of the office,  leaving the owner of the store fuming.
        .
 KISSES AND KLEPTOMANIA.
    "Hello, Dad!"    After the attorney's departure, Gilder had been rather fussily going  over some of the papers on his desk.
 He was experiencing a vague feeling  of injury on account of the lawyer's ill-veiled efforts to arouse his  sympathy in behalf of the accused girl.
 In the instinct of strengthening  himself against the possibility of yielding to what he deemed weakness,  the magnate rehearsed the facts that justified his intolerance, and,  indeed, soon came to gloating over the admirable manner in which  righteousness thrives in the world.
 And it was then that an interruption  came in the utterance of two words, words of affection, of love, cried  out in the one voice he most longed to hear--for the voice was that of  his son.
 Yet, he did not look up.
 The thing was altogether impossible!  The boy was philandering, junketing, somewhere on the Riviera.
 His  first intimation as to the exact place would come in the form of a cable  asking for money.
 Somehow, his feelings had been unduly stirred that  morning; he had grown sentimental, dreaming of pleasant things.
.
.
.
 All  this in a second.
 Then, he looked up.
 Why, it was true! It was Dick's  face there, smiling in the doorway.
 Yes, it was Dick, it was Dick  himself! Gilder sprang to his feet, his face suddenly grown younger,  radiant.
    "Dick!" The big voice was softened to exquisite tenderness.
    As the eyes of the two met, the boy rushed forward, and in the next  moment the hands of father and son clasped firmly.
 They were silent in  the first emotion of their greeting.
 Presently, Gilder spoke, with an  effort toward harshness in his voice to mask how much he was shaken.
  But the tones rang more kindly than any he had used for many a day,  tremulous with affection.
    "What brought you back?" he demanded.
    Dick, too, had felt the tension of an emotion far beyond that of the  usual things.
 He was forced to clear his throat before he answered  with that assumption of nonchalance which he regarded as befitting the  occasion.
    "Why, I just wanted to come back home," he said; lightly.
 A sudden  recollection came to give him poise in this time of emotional  disturbance, and he added hastily: "And, for the love of heaven, give  Sadie five dollars.
 I borrowed it from her to pay the taxi'.
 You see,  Dad, I'm broke.
"    "Of course!" With the saying, Edward Gilder roared Gargantuan laughter.
  In the burst of merriment, his pent feelings found their vent.
 He  was still chuckling when he spoke, sage from much experience of ocean  travel.
 "Poker on the ship, I suppose.
"    The young man, too, smiled reminiscently as he answered:    "No, not that, though I did have a little run in at Monte Carlo.
 But it  was the ship that finished me, at that.
 You see, Dad, they hired Captain  Kidd and a bunch of pirates as stewards, and what they did to little  Richard was something fierce.
 And yet, that wasn't the real trouble,  either.
 The fact is, I just naturally went broke.
 Not a hard thing to do  on the other side.
"    "Nor on this," the father interjected, dryly.
    "Anyhow, it doesn't matter much," Dick replied, quite unabashed.
 "Tell  me, Dad, how goes it?"    Gilder settled himself again in his chair, and gazed benignantly on his  son.
    "Pretty well," he said contentedly; "pretty well, son.
 I'm glad to see  you home again, my boy.
" There was a great tenderness in the usually  rather cold gray eyes.
    The young man answered promptly, with delight in his manner of speech,  and a sincerity that revealed the underlying merit of his nature.
    "And I'm glad to be home, Dad, to be"--there was again that clearing of  the throat, but he finished bravely--"with you.
"    The father avoided a threatening display of emotion by an abrupt change  of subject to the trite.
    "Have a good time?" he inquired casually, while fumbling with the papers  on the desk.
    Dick's face broke in a smile of reminiscent happiness.
    "The time of my young life!" He paused, and the smile broadened.
 There  was a mighty enthusiasm in his voice as he continued: "I tell you, Dad,  it's a fact that I did almost break the bank at Monte Carlo.
 I'd have  done it sure, if only my money had held out.
"    "It seems to me that I've heard something of the sort before," was  Gilder's caustic comment.
 But his smile was still wholly sympathetic.
 He  took a curious vicarious delight in the escapades of his son, probably  because he himself had committed no follies in his callow days.
 "Why  didn't you cable me?" he asked, puzzled at such restraint on the part of  his son.
    Dick answered with simple sincerity.
    "Because it gave me a capital excuse for coming home.
"    It was Sarah who afforded a diversion.
 She had known Dick while he was  yet a child, had bought him candy, had felt toward him a maternal liking  that increased rather than diminished as he grew to manhood.
 Now, her  face lighted at sight of him, and she smiled a welcome.
    "I see you have found him," she said, with a ripple of laughter.
    Dick welcomed this interruption of the graver mood.
    "Sadie," he said, with a manner of the utmost seriousness, "you are  looking finer than ever.
 And how thin you have grown!"    The girl, eager with fond fancies toward the slender ideal, accepted the  compliment literally.
    "Oh, Mr. Dick!" she exclaimed, rapturously.
 "How much do you think I  have lost?"    The whimsical heir of the house of Gilder surveyed his victim  critically, then spoke with judicial solemnity.
    "About two ounces, Sadie.
"    There came a look of deep hurt on Sadie's face at the flippant jest,  which Dick himself was quick to note.
    He had not guessed she was thus acutely sensitive concerning her  plumpness.
 Instantly, he was all contrition over his unwitting offense  inflicted on her womanly vanity.
    "Oh, I'm sorry, Sadie," he exclaimed penitently.
 "Please don't be really  angry with me.
 Of course, I didn't mean----"    "To twit on facts!" the secretary interrupted, bitterly.
    "Pooh!" Dick cried, craftily.
 "You aren't plump enough to be sensitive  about it.
 Why, you're just right.
" There was something very boyish about  his manner, as he caught at the girl's arm.
 A memory of the days when  she had cuddled him caused him to speak warmly, forgetting the presence  of his father.
 "Now, don't be angry, Sadie.
 Just give me a little kiss,  as you used to do.
" He swept her into his arms, and his lips met hers  in a hearty caress.
 "There!" he cried.
 "Just to show there's no ill  feeling.
"    The girl was completely mollified, though in much embarrassment.
    "Why, Mr. Dick!" she stammered, in confusion.
 "Why, Mr. Dick!"    Gilder, who had watched the scene in great astonishment, now interposed  to end it.
    "Stop, Dick!" he commanded, crisply.
 "You are actually making Sarah  blush.
 I think that's about enough, son.
"    But a sudden unaccustomed gust of affection swirled in the breast of  the lad.
 Plain Anglo-Saxon as he was, with all that implies as to the  avoidance of displays of emotion, nevertheless he had been for a  long time in lands far from home, where the habits of impulsive and  affectionate peoples were radically unlike our own austerer forms.
 So  now, under the spur of an impulse suggested by the dalliance with the  buxom secretary, he grinned widely and went to his father.
    "A little kiss never hurts any one," he declared, blithely.
 Then he  added vivaciously: "Here, I'll show you!"    With the words, he clasped his arms around his father's neck, and,  before that amazed gentleman could understand his purpose, he had kissed  soundly first the one cheek and then the other, each with a hearty,  wholesome smack of filial piety.
 This done, he stood back, still beaming  happily, while the astounded Sarah tittered bewilderedly.
 For his own  part, Dick was quite unashamed.
 He loved his father.
 For once, he had  expressed that fondness in a primitive fashion, and he was glad.
    The older man withdrew a step, and there rested motionless, under the  sway of an emotion akin to dismay.
 He stood staring intently at his son  with a perplexity in his expression that was almost ludicrous.
 When, at  last, he spoke, his voice was a rumble of strangely shy pleasure.
    "God bless my soul!" he exclaimed, violently.
 Then he raised a hand, and  rubbed first one cheek, and after it its fellow, with a gentleness that  was significant.
 The feeling provoked by the embrace showed plainly in  his next words.
 "Why, that's the first time you have kissed me, Dick,  since you were a little boy.
 God bless my soul!" he repeated.
 And now  there was a note of jubilation.
    The son, somewhat disturbed by this emotion he had aroused, nevertheless  answered frankly with the expression of his own feeling, as he advanced  and laid a hand on his father's shoulder.
    "The fact is, Dad," he said quietly, with a smile that was good to see,  "I am awfully glad to see you again.
"    "Are you, son?" the father cried happily.
 Then, abruptly his manner  changed, for he felt himself perilously close to the maudlin in this new  yielding to sentimentality.
 Such kisses of tenderness, however agreeable  in themselves, were hardly fitting to one of his dignity.
 "You clear out  of here, boy," he commanded, brusquely.
 "I'm a working man.
 But here,  wait a minute," he added.
 He brought forth from a pocket a neat sheaf of  banknotes, which he held out.
 "There's carfare for you," he said with a  chuckle.
 "And now clear out.
 I'll see you at dinner.
"    Dick bestowed the money in his pocket, and again turned toward the door.
    "You can always get rid of me on the same terms," he remarked slyly.
 And  then the young man gave evidence that he, too, had some of his father's  ability in things financial.
 For, in the doorway he turned with a final  speech, which was uttered in splendid disregard for the packet of money  he had just received--perhaps, rather, in a splendid regard for it.
 "Oh,  Dad, please don't forget to give Sadie that five dollars I borrowed from  her for the taxi'.
" And with that impertinent reminder he was gone.
    The owner of the store returned to his labors with a new zest, for the  meeting with his son had put him in high spirits.
 Perhaps it might have  been better for Mary Turner had she come to him just then, while he  was yet in this softened mood.
 But fate had ordained that other events  should restore him to his usual harder self before their interview.
 The  effect was, indeed, presently accomplished by the advent of Smithson  into the office.
 He entered with an expression of discomfiture on his  rather vacuous countenance.
 He walked almost nimbly to the desk and  spoke with evident distress, as his employer looked up interrogatively.
    "McCracken has detained--er--a--lady, sir," he said, feebly.
 "She has  been searched, and we have found about a hundred dollars worth of laces  on her.
"    "Well?" Gilder demanded, impatiently.
 Such affairs were too common in  the store to make necessary this intrusion of the matter on him.
 "Why  did you come to me about it?" His staff knew just what to do with  shoplifters.
    At once, Smithson became apologetic, while refusing to retreat.
    "I'm very sorry, sir," he said haltingly, "but I thought it wiser, sir,  to--er--to bring the matter to your personal attention.
"    "Quite unnecessary, Smithson," Gilder returned, with asperity.
 "You know  my views on the subject of property.
 Tell McCracken to have the thief  arrested.
"    Smithson cleared his throat doubtfully, and in his stress of feeling  he even relaxed a trifle that majestical erectness of carriage that had  made him so valuable as a floor-walker.
    "She's not exactly a--er--a thief," he ventured.
    "You are trifling, Smithson," the owner of the store exclaimed, in high  exasperation.
 "Not a thief! And you caught her with a hundred dollars  worth of laces that she hadn't bought.
 Not a thief! What in heaven's  name do you call her, then?"    "A kleptomaniac," Smithson explained, retaining his manner of mild  insistence.
 "You see, sir, it's this way.
 The lady happens to be the  wife of J.
 W.
 Gaskell, the banker, you know.
"    Yes, Gilder did know.
 The mention of the name was like a spell in the  effect it wrought on the attitude of the irritated owner of the store.
  Instantly, his expression changed.
 While before his features had been  set grimly, while his eyes had flashed wrathfully, there was now only  annoyance over an event markedly unfortunate.
    "How extremely awkward!" he cried; and there was a very real concern  in his voice.
 He regarded Smithson kindly, whereat that rather puling  gentleman once again assumed his martial bearing.
 "You were quite  right in coming to me.
" For a moment he was silent, plunged in thought.
  Finally he spoke with the decisiveness characteristic of him.
 "Of  course, there's nothing we can do.
 Just put the stuff back on the  counter, and let her go.
"    But Smithson had not yet wholly unburdened himself.
 Instead of  immediately leaving the room in pursuance of the succinct instructions  given him, he again cleared his throat nervously, and made known a  further aggravating factor in the situation.
    "She's very angry, Mr. Gilder," he announced, timidly.
 "She--er--she  demands an--er--an apology.
"    The owner of the store half-rose from his chair, then threw himself back  with an exclamation of disgust.
 He again ejaculated the words with which  he had greeted his son's unexpected kisses, but now there was a vast  difference in the intonation.
    "God bless my soul!" he cried.
 From his expression, it was clear that a  pious aspiration was farthest from his thought.
 On the contrary! Again,  he fell silent, considering the situation which Smithson had presented,  and, as he reflected, his frown betrayed the emotion natural enough  under the circumstances.
 At last, however, he mastered his irritation to  some degree, and spoke his command briefly.
 "Well, Smithson, apologize  to her.
 It can't be helped.
" Then his face lighted with a sardonic  amusement.
 "And, Smithson," he went on with a sort of elephantine  playfulness, "I shall take it as a personal favor if you will tactfully  advise the lady that the goods at Altman and Stern's are really even  finer than ours.
"    When Smithson had left the office, Gilder turned to his secretary.
    "Take this," he directed, and he forthwith dictated the following letter  to the husband of the lady who was not a thief, as Smithson had so  painstakingly pointed out:    "J.
 W.
 GASKELL, ESQ.
,    "Central National Bank, New York.
    "MY DEAR Mr. GASKELL: I feel that I should be doing less than my duty as  a man if I did not let you know at once that Mrs. Gaskell is in urgent  need of medical attention.
 She came into our store to-day, and----"    He paused for a moment.
 "No, put it this way," he said finally:    "We found her wandering about our store to-day in a very nervous  condition.
 In her excitement, she carried away about one hundred  dollars' worth of rare laces.
 Not recognizing her, our store detective  detained her for a short time.
 Fortunately for us all, Mrs. Gaskell was  able to explain who she was, and she has just gone to her home.
 Hoping  for Mrs. Gaskell's speedy recovery, and with all good wishes, I am,    "Yours very truly.
"    Yet, though he had completed the letter, Gilder did not at once take up  another detail of his business.
 Instead, he remained plunged in thought,  and now his frown was one of simple bewilderment.
 A number of minutes  passed before he spoke, and then his words revealed distinctly what had  been his train of meditation.
    "Sadie," he said in a voice of entire sincerity, "I can't understand  theft.
 It's a thing absolutely beyond my comprehension.
"    On the heels of this ingenuous declaration, Smithson entered the office,  and that excellent gentleman appeared even more perturbed than before.
    "What on earth is the matter now?" Gilder spluttered, suspiciously.
    "It's Mrs. Gaskell still," Smithson replied in great trepidation.
 "She  wants you personally, Mr. Gilder, to apologize to her.
 She says that the  action taken against her is an outrage, and she is not satisfied with  the apologies of all the rest of us.
 She says you must make one,  too, and that the store detective must be discharged for intolerable  insolence.
"    Gilder bounced up from his chair angrily.
    "I'll be damned if I'll discharge McCracken," he vociferated, glaring on  Smithson, who shrank visibly.
    But that mild and meek man had a certain strength of pertinacity.
  Besides, in this case, he had been having multitudinous troubles of  his own, which could be ended only by his employer's placating of the  offended kleptomaniac.
    "But about the apology, Mr. Gilder," he reminded, speaking very  deferentially, yet with insistence.
    Business instinct triumphed over the magnate's irritation, and his face  cleared.
    "Oh, I'll apologize," he said with a wry smile of discomfiture.
 "I'll  make things even up a bit when I get an apology from Gaskell.
 I shrewdly  suspect that that estimable gentleman is going to eat humble pie, of my  baking, from his wife's recipe.
 And his will be an honest apology--which  mine won't, not by a damned sight!" With the words, he left the room, in  his wake a hugely relieved Smithson.
    Alone in the office, Sarah neglected her work for a few minutes to brood  over the startling contrast of events that had just forced itself on her  attention.
 She was not a girl given to the analysis of either persons or  things, but in this instance the movement of affairs had come close to  her, and she was compelled to some depth of feeling by the two aspects  of life on which to-day she looked.
 In the one case, as she knew it, a  girl under the urge of poverty had stolen.
 That thief had been promptly  arrested, finally she had been tried, had been convicted, had been  sentenced to three years in prison.
 In the other case, a woman of wealth  had stolen.
 There had been no punishment.
 A euphemism of kleptomania had  been offered and accepted as sufficient excuse for her crime.
 A polite  lie had been written to her husband, a banker of power in the city.
 To  her, the proprietor of the store was even now apologizing in courteous  phrases of regret.
.
.
.
 And Mary Turner had been sentenced to three years  in prison.
 Sadie shook her head in dolorous doubt, as she again bent  over the keys of her typewriter.
 Certainly, some happenings in this  world of ours did not seem quite fair.
        .
 THE VICTIM OF THE LAW.
    It was on this same day that Sarah, on one of her numerous trips through  the store in behalf of Gilder, was accosted by a salesgirl, whose name,  Helen Morris, she chanced to know.
 It was in a spot somewhere out of  the crowd, so that for the moment the two were practically alone.
  The salesgirl showed signs of embarrassment as she ventured to lay a  detaining hand on Sarah's arm, but she maintained her position, despite  the secretary's manner of disapproval.
    "What on earth do you want?" Sarah inquired, snappishly.
    The salesgirl put her question at once.
    "What did they do to Mary Turner?"    "Oh, that!" the secretary exclaimed, with increased impatience over  the delay, for she was very busy, as always.
 "You will all know soon  enough.
"    "Tell me now.
" The voice of the girl was singularly compelling; there  was something vividly impressive about her just now, though her pallid,  prematurely mature face and the thin figure in the regulation black  dress and white apron showed ordinarily only insignificant.
 "Tell me  now," she repeated, with a monotonous emphasis that somehow moved Sarah  to obedience against her will, greatly to her own surprise.
    "They sent her to prison for three years," she answered, sharply.
    "Three years?" The salesgirl had repeated the words in a tone that was  indefinable, yet a tone vehement in its incredulous questioning.
 "Three  years?" she said again, as one refusing to believe.
    "Yes," Sarah said, impressed by the girl's earnestness; "three years.
"    "Good God!" There was no irreverence in the exclamation that broke from  the girl's lips.
 Instead, only a tense horror that touched to the roots  of emotion.
    Sarah regarded this display of feeling on the part of the young woman  before her with an increasing astonishment.
 It was not in her own nature  to be demonstrative, and such strong expression of emotion as this she  deemed rather suspicious.
 She recalled, in addition, the fact that his  was not the first time that Helen Morris had shown a particular interest  in the fate of Mary Turner.
 Sarah wondered why.
    "Say," she demanded, with the directness habitual to her, "why are you  so anxious about it? This is the third time you have asked me about Mary  Turner.
 What's it to you, I'd like to know?"    The salesgirl started violently, and a deep flush drove the accustomed  pallor from her cheeks.
 She was obviously much disturbed by the  question.
    "What is it to me?" she repeated in an effort to gain time.
 "Why,  nothing--nothing at all!" Her expression of distress lightened a little  as she hit on an excuse that might serve to justify her interest.
  "Nothing at all, only--she's a friend of mine, a great friend of mine.
  Oh, yes!" Then, in an instant, the look of relief vanished, as once  again the terrible reality hammered on her consciousness, and an  overwhelming dejection showed in the dull eyes and in the drooping  curves of the white lips.
 There was a monotone of desolation as she  went on speaking in a whisper meant for the ears of no other.
 "It's  awful--three years! Oh, I didn't understand! It's awful!--awful!" With  the final word, she hurried off, her head bowed.
 She was still murmuring  brokenly, incoherently.
 Her whole attitude was of wondering grief.
    Sarah stared after the girl in complete mystification.
 She could not at  first guess any possible cause for an emotion so poignant.
 Presently,  however, her shrewd, though very prosaic, commonsense suggested a simple  explanation of the girl's extraordinary distress.
    "I'll bet that girl has been tempted to steal.
 But she didn't, because  she was afraid.
" With this satisfactory conclusion of her wonderment,  the secretary hurried on her way, quite content.
 It never occurred to  her that the girl might have been tempted to steal--and had not resisted  the temptation.
    It was on account of this brief conversation with the salesgirl that  Sarah was thinking intently of Mary Turner, after her return to the  office, from which Gilder himself happened to be absent for the moment.
  As the secretary glanced up at the opening of the door, she did not at  first recognize the figure outlined there.
 She remembered Mary Turner  as a tall, slender girl, who showed an underlying vitality in every  movement, a girl with a face of regular features, in which was a  complexion of blended milk and roses, with a radiant joy of life shining  through all her arduous and vulgar conditions.
 Instead of this, now, she  saw a frail form that stood swaying in the opening of the doorway, that  bent in a sinister fashion which told of bodily impotence, while the  face was quite bloodless.
 And, too, there was over all else a pall of  helplessness--helplessness that had endured much, and must still endure  infinitely more.
    As a reinforcement of the dread import of that figure of wo, a man stood  beside it, and one of his hands was clasped around the girl's wrist, a  man who wore his derby hat somewhat far back on his bullet-shaped head,  whose feet were conspicuous in shoes with very heavy soles and very  square toes.
    It was the man who now took charge of the situation.
 Cassidy, from  Headquarters, spoke in a rough, indifferent voice, well suited to his  appearance of stolid strength.
    "The District Attorney told me to bring this girl here on my way to the  Grand Central Station with her.
"    Sarah got to her feet mechanically.
 Somehow, from the raucous notes of  the policeman's voice, she understood in a flash of illumination that  the pitiful figure there in the doorway was that of Mary Turner, whom  she had remembered so different, so frightfully different.
 She spoke  with a miserable effort toward her usual liveliness.
    "Mr. Gilder will be right back.
 Come in and wait.
" She wished to say  something more, something of welcome or of mourning, to the girl there,  but she found herself incapable of a single word for the moment, and  could only stand dumb while the man stepped forward, with his charge  following helplessly in his clutch.
    The two went forward very slowly, the officer, carelessly conscious of  his duty, walking with awkward steps to suit the feeble movements of the  girl, the girl letting herself be dragged onward, aware of the futility  of any resistance to the inexorable power that now had her in its  grip, of which the man was the present agent.
 As the pair came thus  falteringly into the center of the room, Sarah at last found her voice  for an expression of sympathy.
    "I'm sorry, Mary," she said, hesitatingly.
 "I'm terribly sorry, terribly  sorry!"    The girl, who had halted when the officer halted, as a matter of course,  did not look up.
 She stood still, swaying a little as if from weakness.
  Her voice was lifeless.
    "Are you?" she said.
 "I did not know.
 Nobody has been near me the whole  time I have been in the Tombs.
" There was infinite pathos in the tones  as she repeated the words so fraught with dreadfulness.
 "Nobody has been  near me!"    The secretary felt a sudden glow of shame.
 She realized the justice of  that unconscious accusation, for, till to-day, she had had no thought of  the suffering girl there in the prison.
 To assuage remorse, she sought  to give evidence as to a prevalent sympathy.
    "Why," she exclaimed, "there was Helen Morris to-day! She has been  asking about you again and again.
 She's all broken up over your  trouble.
"    But the effort on the secretary's part was wholly without success.
    "Who is Helen Morris?" the lifeless voice demanded.
 There was no  interest in the question.
    Sarah experienced a momentary astonishment, for she was still  remembering the feverish excitement displayed by the salesgirl, who had  declared herself to be a most intimate friend of the convict.
 But the  mystery was to remain unsolved, since Gilder now entered the office.
 He  walked with the quick, bustling activity that was ordinarily expressed  in his every movement.
 He paused for an instant, as he beheld the  two visitors in the center of the room, then he spoke curtly to the  secretary, while crossing to his chair at the desk.
    "You may go, Sarah.
 I will ring when I wish you again.
"    There followed an interval of silence, while the secretary was leaving  the office and the girl with her warder stood waiting on his pleasure.
  Gilder cleared his throat twice in an embarrassment foreign to him,  before finally he spoke to the girl.
 At last, the proprietor of  the store expressed himself in a voice of genuine sympathy, for the  spectacle of wo presented there before his very eyes moved him to a real  distress, since it was indeed actual, something that did not depend on  an appreciation to be developed out of imagination.
    "My girl," Gilder said gently--his hard voice was softened by an honest  regret--"my girl, I am sorry about this.
"    "You should be!" came the instant answer.
 Yet, the words were uttered  with a total lack of emotion.
 It seemed from their intonation that  the speaker voiced merely a statement concerning a recondite matter of  truth, with which sentiment had nothing whatever to do.
 But the effect  on the employer was unfortunate.
 It aroused at once his antagonism  against the girl.
 His instinct of sympathy with which he had greeted  her at the outset was repelled, and made of no avail.
 Worse, it was  transformed into an emotion hostile to the one who thus offended him by  rejection of the well-meant kindliness of his address    "Come, come!" he exclaimed, testily.
 "That's no tone to take with me.
"    "Why? What sort of tone do you expect me to take?" was the retort in  the listless voice.
 Yet, now, in the dullness ran a faint suggestion of  something sinister.
    "I expected a decent amount of humility from one in your position," was  the tart rejoinder of the magnate.
    Life quickened swiftly in the drooping form of the girl.
 Her muscles  tensed.
 She stood suddenly erect, in the vigor of her youth again.
 Her  face lost in the same second its bleakness of pallor.
 The eyes opened  widely, with startling abruptness, and looked straight into those of the  man who had employed her.
    "Would you be humble," she demanded, and now her voice was become softly  musical, yet forbidding, too, with a note of passion, "would you be  humble if you were going to prison for three years--for something you  didn't do?"    There was anguish in the cry torn from the girl's throat in the sudden  access of despair.
 The words thrilled Gilder beyond anything that he  had supposed possible in such case.
 He found himself in this emergency  totally at a loss, and moved in his chair doubtfully, wishing to say  something, and quite unable.
 He was still seeking some question, some  criticism, some rebuke, when he was unfeignedly relieved to hear the  policeman's harsh voice.
    "Don't mind her, sir," Cassidy said.
 He meant to make his manner very  reassuring.
 "They all say that.
 They are innocent, of course! Yep--they  all say it.
 It don't do 'em any good, but just the same they all swear  they're innocent.
 They keep it up to the very last, no matter how right  they've been got.
"    The voice of the girl rang clear.
 There was a note of insistence  that carried a curious dignity of its own.
 The very simplicity of her  statement might have had a power to convince one who listened without  prejudice, although the words themselves were of the trite sort that any  protesting criminal might utter.
    "I tell you, I didn't do it!"    Gilder himself felt the surge of emotion that swung through these  moments, but he would not yield to it.
 With his lack of imagination,  he could not interpret what this time must mean to the girl before him.
  Rather, he merely deemed it his duty to carry through this unfortunate  affair with a scrupulous attention to detail, in the fashion that had  always been characteristic of him during the years in which he had  steadily mounted from the bottom to the top.
    "What's the use of all this pretense?" he demanded, sharply.
 "You were  given a fair trial, and there's an end of it.
"    The girl, standing there so feebly, seeming indeed to cling for support  to the man who always held her thus closely by the wrist, spoke again  with an astonishing clearness, even with a sort of vivacity, as if she  explained easily something otherwise in doubt.
    "Oh, no, I wasn't!" she contradicted bluntly, with a singular confidence  of assertion.
 "Why, if the trial had been fair, I shouldn't be here.
"    The harsh voice of Cassidy again broke in on the passion of the girl  with a professional sneer.
    "That's another thing they all say.
"    But the girl went on speaking fiercely, impervious to the man's coarse  sarcasm, her eyes, which had deepened almost to purple, still fixed  piercingly on Gilder, who, for some reason wholly inexplicable to him,  felt himself strangely disturbed under that regard.
    "Do you call it fair when the lawyer I had was only a boy--one whom the  court told me to take, a boy trying his first case--my case, that  meant the ruin of my life? My lawyer! Why, he was just getting  experience--getting it at my expense!" The girl paused as if exhausted  by the vehemence of her emotion, and at last the sparkling eyes drooped  and the heavy lids closed over them.
 She swayed a little, so that the  officer tightened his clasp on her wrist.
    There followed a few seconds of silence.
 Then Gilder made an effort to  shake off the feeling that had so possessed him, and to a certain degree  he succeeded.
    "The jury found you guilty," he asserted, with an attempt to make his  voice magisterial in its severity.
    Instantly, Mary was aroused to a new outburst of protest.
 Once again,  her eyes shot their fires at the man seated behind the desk, and she  went forward a step imperiously, dragging the officer in her wake.
    "Yes, the jury found me guilty," she agreed, with fine scorn in the  musical cadences of her voice.
 "Do you know why? I can tell you,  Mr. Gilder.
 It was because they had been out for three hours without  reaching a decision.
 The evidence didn't seem to be quite enough for  some of them, after all.
 Well, the judge threatened to lock them up all  night.
 The men wanted to get home.
 The easy thing to do was to find me  guilty, and let it go at that.
 Was that fair, do you think? And that's  not all, either.
 Was it fair of you, Mr. Gilder? Was it fair of you to  come to the court this morning, and tell the judge that I should be sent  to prison as a warning to others?"    A quick flush burned on the massive face of the man whom she thus  accused, and his eyes refused to meet her steady gaze of reproach.
    "You know!" he exclaimed, in momentary consternation.
 Again, her mood  had affected his own, so that through a few hurrying seconds he felt  himself somehow guilty of wrong against this girl, so frank and so  rebuking.
    "I heard you in the courtroom," she said.
 "The dock isn't very far from  the bench where you spoke to the judge about my case.
 Yes, I heard you.
  It wasn't: Did I do it? Or, didn't I do it? No; it was only that I must  be made a warning to others.
"    Again, silence fell for a tense interval.
 Then, finally, the girl spoke  in a different tone.
 Where before her voice had been vibrant with the  instinct of complaint against the mockery of justice under which she  suffered, now there was a deeper note, that of most solemn truth.
    "Mr. Gilder," she said simply, "as God is my judge, I am going to prison  for three years for something I didn't do.
"    But the sincerity of her broken cry fell on unheeding ears.
 The coarse  nature of the officer had long ago lost whatever elements of softness  there might have been to develop in a gentler occupation.
 As for the  owner of the store, he was not sufficiently sensitive to feel the verity  in the accents of the speaker.
 Moreover, he was a man who followed the  conventional, with never a distraction due to imagination and sympathy.
  Just now, too, he was experiencing a keen irritation against himself  because of the manner in which he had been sensible to the influence  of her protestation, despite his will to the contrary.
 That irritation  against himself only reacted against the girl, and caused him to  steel his heart to resist any tendency toward commiseration.
 So, this  declaration of innocence was made quite in vain--indeed, served rather  to strengthen his disfavor toward the complainant, and to make his  manner harsher when she voiced the pitiful question over which she had  wondered and grieved.
    "Why did you ask the judge to send me to prison?"    "The thieving that has been going on in this store for over a year has  got to stop," Gilder answered emphatically, with all his usual energy  of manner restored.
 As he spoke, he raised his eyes and met the girl's  glance fairly.
 Thought of the robberies was quite enough to make him  pitiless toward the offender.
    "Sending me to prison won't stop it," Mary Turner said, drearily.
    "Perhaps not," Gilder sternly retorted.
 "But the discovery and  punishment of the other guilty ones will.
" His manner changed to a  business-like alertness.
 "You sent word to me that you could tell me how  to stop the thefts in the store.
 Well, my girl, do this, and, while I  can make no definite promise, I'll see what can be done about getting  you out of your present difficulty.
" He picked up a pencil, pulled a  pad of blank paper convenient to his hand, and looked at the girl  expectantly, with aggressive inquiry in his gaze.
 "Tell me now," he  concluded, "who were your pals?"    The matter-of-fact manner of this man who had unwittingly wronged her so  frightfully was the last straw on the girl's burden of suffering.
 Under  it, her patient endurance broke, and she cried out in a voice of utter  despair that caused Gilder to start nervously, and even impelled the  stolid officer to a frown of remonstrance.
    "I have no pals!" she ejaculated, furiously.
 "I never stole anything in  my life.
 Must I go on telling you over and over again?" Her voice rose  in a wail of misery.
 "Oh, why won't any one believe me?"    Gilder was much offended by this display of an hysterical grief, which  seemed to his phlegmatic temperament altogether unwarranted by the  circumstances.
 He spoke decisively.
    "Unless you can control yourself, you must go.
" He pushed away the pad  of paper, and tossed the pencil aside in physical expression of his  displeasure.
 "Why did you send that message, if you have nothing to  say?" he demanded, with increasing choler.
    But now the girl had regained her former poise.
 She stood a little  drooping and shaken, where for a moment she had been erect and tensed.
  There was a vast weariness in her words as she answered.
    "I have something to tell you, Mr. Gilder," she said, quietly.
 "Only,  I--I sort of lost my grip on the way here, with this man by my side.
"    "Most of 'em do, the first time," the officer commented, with a certain  grim appreciation.
    "Well?" Gilder insisted querulously, as the girl hesitated.
    At once, Mary went on speaking, and now a little increase of vigor  trembled in her tones.
    "When you sit in a cell for three months waiting for your trial, as I  did, you think a lot.
 And, so, I got the idea that if I could talk to  you, I might be able to make you understand what's really wrong.
 And if  I could do that, and so help out the other girls, what has happened to  me would not, after all, be quite so awful--so useless, somehow.
" Her  voice lowered to a quick pleading, and she bent toward the man at the  desk.
 "Mr. Gilder," she questioned, "do you really want to stop the  girls from stealing?"    "Most certainly I do," came the forcible reply.
    The girl spoke with a great earnestness, deliberately.
    "Then, give them a fair chance.
"    The magnate stared in sincere astonishment over this absurd, this futile  suggestion for his guidance.
    "What do you mean?" he vociferated, with rising indignation.
 There was  an added hostility in his demeanor, for it seemed to him that this thief  of his goods whom he had brought to justice was daring to trifle with  him.
 He grew wrathful over the suspicion, but a secret curiosity still  held his temper within bounds "What do you mean?" he repeated; and now  the full force of his strong voice set the room trembling.
    The tones of the girl came softly musical, made more delicately resonant  to the ear by contrast with the man's roaring.
    "Why," she said, very gently, "I mean just this: Give them a living  chance to be honest.
"    "A living chance!" The two words were exploded with dynamic violence.
  The preposterousness of the advice fired Gilder with resentment so  pervasive that through many seconds he found himself unable to express  the rage that flamed within him.
    The girl showed herself undismayed by his anger.
    "Yes," she went on, quietly; "that's all there is to it.
 Give them a  living chance to get enough food to eat, and a decent room to sleep in,  and shoes that will keep their feet off the pavement winter mornings.
 Do  you think that any girl wants to steal? Do you think that any girl wants  to risk----?"    By this time, however, Gilder had regained his powers of speech, and he  interrupted stormily.
    "And is this what you have taken up my time for? You want to make a  maudlin plea for guilty, dishonest girls, when I thought you really  meant to bring me facts.
"    Nevertheless, Mary went on with her arraignment uncompromisingly.
 There  was a strange, compelling energy in her inflections that penetrated even  the pachydermatous officer, so that, though he thought her raving, he  let her rave on, which was not at all his habit of conduct, and did  indeed surprise him mightily.
 As for Gilder, he felt helpless in some  puzzling fashion that was totally foreign to his ordinary self.
 He was  still glowing with wrath over the method by which he had been victimized  into giving the girl a hearing.
 Yet, despite his chagrin, he realized  that he could not send her from him forthwith.
 By some inexplicable  spell she bound him impotent.
    "We work nine hours a day," the quiet voice went on, a curious pathos  in the rich timbre of it; "nine hours a day, for six days in the week.
  That's a fact, isn't it? And the trouble is, an honest girl can't live  on six dollars a week.
 She can't do it, and buy food and clothes, and  pay room-rent and carfare.
 That's another fact, isn't it?"    Mary regarded the owner of the store with grave questioning in her  violet eyes.
 Under the urgency of emotion, color crept into the pallid  cheeks, and now her face was very beautiful--so beautiful, indeed, that  for a little the charm of its loveliness caught the man's gaze, and he  watched her with a new respect, born of appreciation for her feminine  delightfulness.
 The impression was far too brief.
 Gilder was not given  to esthetic raptures over women.
 Always, the business instinct was the  dominant.
 So, after the short period of amazed admiration over such  unexpected winsomeness, his thoughts flew back angrily to the matters  whereof she spoke so ridiculously.
    "I don't care to discuss these things," he declared peremptorily, as the  girl remained silent for a moment.
    "And I have no wish to discuss anything," Mary returned evenly.
 "I  only want to give you what you asked for--facts.
" A faint smile of  reminiscence curved the girl's lips.
 "When they first locked me up," she  explained, without any particular evidence of emotion, "I used to sit  and hate you.
"    "Oh, of course!" came the caustic exclamation from Gilder.
    "And then, I thought that perhaps you did not understand," Mary  continued; "that, if I were to tell you how things really are, it might  be you would change them somehow.
"    At this ingenuous statement, the owner of the store gave forth a gasp of  sheer stupefaction.
    "I!" he cried, incredulously.
 "I change my business policy because you  ask me to!"    There was something imperturbable in the quality of the voice as the  girl went resolutely forward with her explanation.
 It was as if she  were discharging a duty not to be gainsaid, not to be thwarted by  any difficulty, not even the realization that all the effort must be  ultimately in vain.
    "Do you know how we girls live?--but, of course, you don't.
 Three of us  in one room, doing our own cooking over the two-burner gas-stove, and  our own washing and ironing evenings, after being on our feet for nine  hours.
"    The enumeration of the sordid details left the employer absolutely  unmoved, since he lacked the imagination necessary to sympathize  actually with the straining evil of a life such as the girl had known.
  Indeed, he spoke with an air of just remonstrance, as if the girl's  charges were mischievously faulty.
    "I have provided chairs behind the counters," he stated.
    There was no especial change in the girl's voice as she answered his  defense.
 It continued musically low, but there was in it the insistent  note of sincerity.
    "But have you ever seen a girl sitting in one of them?" she questioned,  coldly.
 "Please answer me.
 Have you? Of course not," she said, after a  little pause during which the owner had remained silent.
 She shook  her head in emphatic negation.
 "And do you understand why? It's simply  because every girl knows that the manager of her department would think  he could get along without her, if he were to see her sitting down  ----loafing, you know! So, she would be discharged.
 All it amounts to  is that, after being on her feet for nine hours, the girl usually walks  home, in order to save carfare.
 Yes, she walks, whether sick or well.
  Anyhow, you are generally so tired, it don't make much difference which  you are.
"    Gilder was fuming under these strictures, which seemed to him altogether  baseless attacks on himself.
 His exasperation steadily waxed against the  girl, a convicted felon, who thus had the audacity to beard him.
    "What has all this to do with the question of theft in the store?"  he rumbled, huffily.
 "That was the excuse for your coming here.
 And,  instead of telling me something, you rant about gas-stoves and carfare.
"    The inexorable voice went on in its monotone, as if he had not spoken.
    "And, when you are really sick, and have to stop work, what are you  going to do then? Do you know, Mr. Gilder, that the first time a  straight girl steals, it's often because she had to have a doctor--or  some luxury like that? And some of them do worse than steal.
 Yes, they  do--girls that started straight, and wanted to stay that way.
 But, of  course, some of them get so tired of the whole grind that--that----"    The man who was the employer of hundreds concerning whom these grim  truths were uttered, stirred uneasily in his chair, and there came a  touch of color into the healthy brown of his cheeks as he spoke his  protest.
    "I'm not their guardian.
 I can't watch over them after they leave the  store.
 They are paid the current rate of wages--as much as any other  store pays.
" As he spoke, the anger provoked by this unexpected  assault on him out of the mouth of a convict flamed high in virtuous  repudiation.
 "Why," he went on vehemently, "no man living does more  for his employees than I do.
 Who gave the girls their fine rest-rooms  upstairs? I did! Who gave them the cheap lunch-rooms? I did!"    "But you won't pay them enough to live on!" The very fact that the words  were spoken without any trace of rancor merely made this statement of  indisputable truth obnoxious to the man, who was stung to more savage  resentment in asserting his impugned self-righteousness.
    "I pay them the same as the other stores do," he repeated, sullenly.
    Yet once again, the gently cadenced voice gave answer, an answer  informed with that repulsive insistence to the man who sought to resist  her indictment of him.
    "But you won't pay them enough to live on.
" The simple lucidity of the  charge forbade direct reply.
    Gilder betook himself to evasion by harking back to the established  ground of complaint.
    "And, so, you claim that you were forced to steal.
 That's the plea you  make for yourself and your friends.
"    "I wasn't forced to steal," came the answer, spoken in the monotone that  had marked her utterance throughout most of the interview.
 "I wasn't  forced to steal, and I didn't steal.
 But, all the same, that's the plea,  as you call it, that I'm making for the other girls.
 There are hundreds  of them who steal because they don't get enough to eat.
 I said I would  tell you how to stop the stealing.
 Well, I have done it.
 Give the girls  a fair chance to be honest.
 You asked me for the names, Mr. Gilder.
  There's only one name on which to put the blame for the whole  business--and that name is Edward Gilder!.
.
.
 Now, won't you do something  about it?"    At that naked question, the owner of the store jumped up from his  chair, and stood glowering at the girl who risked a request so full of  vituperation against himself.
    "How dare you speak to me like this?" he thundered.
    There was no disconcertion exhibited by the one thus challenged.
 On the  contrary, she repeated her question with a simple dignity that still  further outraged the man.
    "Won't you, please, do something about it?"    "How dare you?" he shouted again.
 Now, there was stark wonder in his  eyes as he put the question.
    "Why, I dared," Mary Turner explained, "because you have done all the  harm you can to me.
 And, now, I'm trying to give you the chance to do  better by the others.
 You ask me why I dare.
 I have a right to dare!  I have been straight all my life.
 I have wanted decent food and warm  clothes, and--a little happiness, all the time I have worked for you,  and I have gone without those things, just to stay straight.
.
.
.
 The end  of it all is: You are sending me to prison for something I didn't do.
  That's why I dare!"    Cassidy, the officer in charge of Mary Turner, had stood patiently  beside her all this while, always holding her by the wrist.
 He had  been mildly interested in the verbal duel between the big man of the  department store and this convict in his own keeping.
 Vaguely, he had  marveled at the success of the frail girl in declaiming of her injuries  before the magnate.
 He had felt no particular interest beyond that,  merely looking on as one might at any entertaining spectacle.
 The  question at issue was no concern of his.
 His sole business was to take  the girl away when the interview should be ended.
 It occurred to him now  that this might, in fact, be the time to depart.
 It seemed, indeed, that  the insistent reiteration of the girl had at last left he owner of the  store quite powerless to answer.
 It was possible, then, that it were  wiser the girl should be removed.
 With the idea in mind, he stared  inquiringly at Gilder until he caught that flustered gentleman's eye.
  A nod from the magnate sufficed him.
 Gilder, in truth, could not trust  himself just then to an audible command.
 He was seriously disturbed by  the gently spoken truths that had issued from the girl's lips.
 He was  not prepared with any answer, though he hotly resented every word of  her accusation.
 So, when he caught the question in the glance of  the officer, he felt a guilty sensation of relief as he signified an  affirmative by his gesture.
    Cassidy faced about, and in his movement there was a tug at the wrist  of the girl that set her moving toward the door.
 Her realization of what  this meant was shown in her final speech.
    "Oh, he can take me now," she said, bitterly.
 Then her voice rose above  the monotone that had contented her hitherto.
 Into the music of her  tones beat something sinister, evilly vindictive, as she faced about at  the doorway to which Cassidy had led her.
 Her face, as she scrutinized  once again the man at the desk, was coldly malignant.
    "Three years isn't forever," she said, in a level voice.
 "When I come  out, you are going to pay for every minute of them, Mr. Gilder.
 There  won't be a day or an hour that I won't remember that at the last it was  your word sent me to prison.
 And you are going to pay me for that.
 You  are going to pay me for the five years I have starved making money for  you--that, too! You are going to pay me for all the things I am losing  today, and----"    The girl thrust forth her left hand, on that side where stood the  officer.
 So vigorous was her movement that Cassidy's clasp was thrown  off the wrist.
 But the bond between the two was not broken, for from  wrist to wrist showed taut the steel chain of the manacles.
 The girl  shook the links of the handcuffs in a gesture stronger than words.
 In  her final utterance to the agitated man at the desk, there was a cold  threat, a prophecy of disaster.
 From the symbol of her degradation, she  looked to the man whose action had placed it there.
 In the clashing of  their glances, hers won the victory, so that his eyes fell before the  menace in hers.
    "You are going to pay me for this!" she said.
 Her voice was little more  than a whisper, but it was loud in the listener's heart.
 "Yes, you are  going to pay--for this!"        .
 INFERNO.
    They were grim years, those three during which Mary Turner served her  sentence in Burnsing.
 There was no time off for good behavior.
 The girl  learned soon that the favor of those set in authority over her could  only be won at a cost against which her every maidenly instinct  revolted.
 So, she went through the inferno of days and nights in a  dreariness of suffering that was deadly.
 Naturally, the life there was  altogether an evil thing.
 There was the material ill ever present in  the round of wearisome physical toil, the coarse, distasteful food, the  hard, narrow couch, the constant, gnawing irksomeness of imprisonment,  away from light and air, away from all that makes life worth while.
    Yet, these afflictions were not the worst injuries to mar the girl  convict's life.
 That which bore upon her most weightily and incessantly  was the degradation of this environment from which there was never any  respite, the viciousness of this spot wherein she had been cast through  no fault of her own.
 Vileness was everywhere, visibly in the faces of  many, and it was brimming from the souls of more, subtly hideous.
 The  girl held herself rigidly from any personal intimacy with her fellows.
  To some extent, at least, she could separate herself from their  corruption in the matter of personal association.
 But, ever present,  there was a secret energy of vice that could not be escaped so  simply--nor, indeed, by any device; that breathed in the spiritual  atmosphere itself of the place.
 Always, this mysterious, invisible, yet  horribly potent, power of sin was like a miasma throughout the prison.
  Always, it was striving to reach her soul, to make her of its own.
 She  fought the insidious, fetid force as best she might.
 She was not evil  by nature.
 She had been well grounded in principles of righteousness.
  Nevertheless, though she maintained the integrity of her character,  that character suffered from the taint.
 There developed over the girl's  original sensibility a shell of hardness, which in time would surely  come to make her less scrupulous in her reckoning of right and wrong.
    Yet, as a rule, character remains the same throughout life as to its  prime essentials, and, in this case, Mary Turner at the end of her term  was vitally almost as wholesome as on the day when she began the serving  of the sentence.
 The change wrought in her was chiefly of an external  sort.
 The kindliness of her heart and her desire for the seemly joys of  life were unweakened.
 But over the better qualities of her nature  was now spread a crust of worldly hardness, a denial of appeal to her  sensibilities.
 It was this that would eventually bring her perilously  close to contented companioning with crime.
    The best evidence of the fact that Mary Turner's soul was not fatally  soiled must be found in the fact that still, at the expiration of her  sentence, she was fully resolved to live straight, as the saying is  which she had quoted to Gilder.
 This, too, in the face of sure knowledge  as to the difficulties that would beset the effort, and in the face of  the temptations offered to follow an easier path.
    There was, for example, Aggie Lynch, a fellow convict, with whom she  had a slight degree of acquaintance, nothing more.
 This young woman, a  criminal by training, offered allurements of illegitimate employment in  the outer world when they should be free.
 Mary endured the companionship  with this prisoner because a sixth sense proclaimed the fact that here  was one unmoral, rather than immoral--and the difference is mighty.
 For  that reason, Aggie Lynch was not actively offensive, as were most of the  others.
 She was a dainty little blonde, with a baby face, in which were  set two light-blue eyes, of a sort to widen often in demure wonder over  most things in a surprising and naughty world.
 She had been convicted of  blackmail, and she made no pretense even of innocence.
 Instead, she was  inclined to boast over her ability to bamboozle men at her will.
 She  was a natural actress of the ingenue role, and in that pose she could  unfailingly beguile the heart of the wisest of worldly men.
    Perhaps, the very keen student of physiognomy might have discovered  grounds for suspecting her demureness by reason of the thick, level  brows that cast a shadow on the bland innocence of her face.
 For the  rest, she possessed a knack of rather harmless perversity, a fair  smattering of grammar and spelling, and a lively sense of humor within  her own limitations, with a particularly small intelligence in other  directions.
 Her one art was histrionics of the kind that made an  individual appeal.
 In such, she was inimitable.
 She had been reared in a  criminal family, which must excuse much.
 Long ago, she had lost track  of her father; her mother she had never known.
 Her one relation was a  brother of high standing as a pickpocket.
 One principal reason of her  success in leading on men to make fools of themselves over her, to their  everlasting regret afterward, lay in the fact that, in spite of all the  gross irregularities of her life, she remained chaste.
 She deserved no  credit for such restraint, since it was a matter purely of temperament,  not of resolve.
    The girl saw in Mary Turner the possibilities of a ladylike personality  that might mean much financial profit in the devious ways of which she  was a mistress.
 With the frankness characteristic of her, she proceeded  to paint glowing pictures of a future shared to the undoing of ardent  and fatuous swains.
 Mary Turner listened with curiosity, but she was in  no wise moved to follow such a life, even though it did not necessitate  anything worse than a fraudulent playing at love, without physical  degradation.
 So, she steadfastly continued her refusals, to the great  astonishment of Aggie, who actually could not understand in the least,  even while she believed the other's declaration of innocence of the  crime for which she was serving a sentence.
 But, for her own part, such  innocence had nothing to do with the matter.
 Where, indeed, could be  the harm in making some old sinner pay a round price for his folly? And  always, in response to every argument, Mary shook her head in negation.
  She would live straight.
    Then, the heavy brows of Aggie would draw down a little, and the baby  face would harden.
    "You will find that you are up against a hell of a frost," she would  declare, brutally.
    Mary found the profane prophecy true.
 Back in New York, she experienced  a poverty more ravaging than any she had known in those five lean years  of her working in the store.
 She had been absolutely penniless for two  days, and without food through the gnawing hours, when she at last found  employment of the humblest in a milliner's shop.
 Followed a blessed  interval in which she worked contentedly, happy over the meager stipend,  since it served to give her shelter and food honestly earned.
    But the ways of the police are not always those of ordinary decency.
 In  due time, an officer informed Mary's employer concerning the fact of  her record as a convict, and thereupon she was at once discharged.
 The  unfortunate victim of the law came perilously close to despair then.
  Yet, her spirit triumphed, and again she persevered in that resolve  to live straight.
 Finally, for the second time, she secured a cheap  position in a cheap shop--only to be again persecuted by the police, so  that she speedily lost the place.
    Nevertheless, indomitable in her purpose, she maintained the struggle.
  A third time she obtained work, and there, after a little, she told  her employer, a candy manufacturer in a small way, the truth as to her  having been in prison.
 The man had a kindly heart, and, in addition,  he ran little risk in the matter, so he allowed her to remain.
 When,  presently, the police called his attention to the girl's criminal  record, he paid no heed to their advice against retaining her services.
  But such action on his part offended the greatness of the law's dignity.
  The police brought pressure to bear on the man.
 They even called in the  assistance of Edward Gilder himself, who obligingly wrote a very severe  letter to the girl's employer.
 In the end, such tactics alarmed the  man.
 For the sake of his own interests, though unwillingly enough, he  dismissed Mary from his service.
    It was then that despair did come upon the girl.
 She had tried with all  the strength of her to live straight.
 Yet, despite her innocence,  the world would not let her live according to her own conscience.
 It  demanded that she be the criminal it had branded her--if she were to  live at all.
 So, it was despair! For she would not turn to evil, and  without such turning she could not live.
 She still walked the streets  falteringly, seeking some place; but her heart was gone from the quest.
  Now, she was sunken in an apathy that saved her from the worst pangs  of misery.
 She had suffered so much, so poignantly, that at last her  emotions had grown sluggish.
 She did not mind much even when her tiny  hoard of money was quite gone, and she roamed the city, starving.
.
.
.
  Came an hour when she thought of the river, and was glad!    Mary remembered, with a wan smile, how, long ago, she had thought with  amazed horror of suicide, unable to imagine any trouble sufficient  to drive one to death as the only relief.
 Now, however, the thing was  simple to her.
 Since there was nothing else, she must turn to that--to  death.
 Indeed, it was so very simple, so final, and so easy, after the  agonies she had endured, that she marveled over her own folly in not  having sought such escape before.
.
.
.
 Even with the first wild fancy, she  had unconsciously bent her steps westward toward the North River.
 Now,  she quickened her pace, anxious for the plunge that should set the term  to sorrow.
 In her numbed brain was no flicker of thought as to whatever  might come to her afterward.
 Her sole guide was that compelling  passion of desire to be done with this unbearable present.
 Nothing else  mattered--not in the least!    So, she came through the long stretch of ill-lighted streets, crossed  some railroad tracks to a pier, over which she hurried to the far end,  where it projected out to the fiercer currents of the Hudson.
 There,  without giving herself a moment's pause for reflection or hesitation,  she leaped out as far as her strength permitted into the coil of  waters.
.
.
.
 But, in that final second, natural terror in the face of  death overcame the lethargy of despair--a shriek burst from her lips.
    But for that scream of fear, the story of Mary Turner had ended there  and then.
 Only one person was anywhere near to catch the sound.
 And that  single person heard.
 On the south side of the pier a man had just tied  up a motor-boat.
 He stood up in alarm at the cry, and was just in time  to gain a glimpse of a white face under the dim moonlight as it swept  down with the tide, two rods beyond him.
 On the instant, he threw off  his coat and sprang far out after the drifting body.
 He came to it in a  few furious strokes, caught it.
 Then began the savage struggle to save  her and himself.
 The currents tore at him wrathfully, but he fought  against them with all the fierceness of his nature.
 He had strength  a-plenty, but it needed all of it, and more, to win out of the river's  hungry clutch.
 What saved the two of them was the violent temper of the  man.
 Always, it had been the demon to set him aflame.
 To-night, there  in the faint light, within the grip of the waters, he was moved to  insensate fury against the element that menaced.
 His rage mounted, and  gave him new power in the battle.
 Maniacal strength grew out of supreme  wrath.
 Under the urge of it, he conquered--at last brought himself and  his charge to the shore.
    When, finally, the rescuer was able to do something more than gasp  chokingly, he gave anxious attention to the woman whom he had brought  out from the river.
 Yet, at the outset, he could not be sure that she  still lived.
 She had shown no sign of life at any time since he had  first seized her.
 That fact had been of incalculable advantage to him  in his efforts to reach the shore with her.
 Now, however, it alarmed him  mightily, though it hardly seemed possible that she could have drowned.
  So far as he could determine, she: had not even sunk once beneath the  surface.
 Nevertheless, she displayed no evidence of vitality, though  he chafed her hands for a long time.
 The shore here was very lonely; it  would take precious time to summon aid.
 It seemed, notwithstanding, that  this must be the only course.
 Then just as the man was about to leave  her, the girl sighed, very faintly, with an infinite weariness, and  opened her eyes.
 The man echoed the sigh, but his was of joy, since now  he knew that his strife in the girl's behalf had not been in vain.
    Afterward, the rescuer experienced no great difficulty in carrying  out his work to a satisfactory conclusion.
 Mary revived to clear  consciousness, which was at first inclined toward hysteria, but this  phase yielded soon under the sympathetic ministrations of the man.
 His  rather low voice was soothing to her tired soul, and his whole air  was at once masterful and gently tender.
 Moreover, there was an  inexpressible balm to her spirit in the very fact that some one was thus  ministering to her.
 It was the first time for many dreadful years that  any one had taken thought for her welfare.
 The effect of it was like a  draught of rarest wine to warm her heart.
 So, she rested obediently as  he busied himself with her complete restoration, and, when finally she  was able to stand, and to walk with the support of his arm, she went  forward slowly at his side without so much even as a question of  whither.
    And, curiously, the man himself shared the gladness that touched  the mood of the girl, for he experienced a sudden pride in his  accomplishment of the night, a pride that delighted a starved part of  his nature.
 Somewhere in him were the seeds of self-sacrifice, the  seeds of a generous devotion to others.
 But those seeds had been left  undeveloped in a life that had been lived since early boyhood outside  the pale of respectability.
 To-night, Joe Garson had performed, perhaps,  his first action with no thought of self at the back of it.
 He had  risked his life to save that of a stranger.
 The fact astonished him,  while it pleased him hugely.
 The sensation was at once novel and  thrilling.
 Since it was so agreeable, he meant to prolong the glow of  self-satisfaction by continuing to care for this waif of the river.
 He  must make his rescue complete.
 It did not occur to him to question his  fitness for the work.
 His introspection did not reach to a point of  suspecting that he, an habitual criminal, was necessarily of a sort to  be most objectionable as the protector of a young girl.
 Indeed, had any  one suggested the thought to him, he would have met it with a sneer, to  the effect that a wretch thus tired of life could hardly object to any  one who constituted himself her savior.
    In this manner, Joe Garson, the notorious forger, led the dripping girl  eastward through the squalid streets, until at last they came to an  adequately lighted avenue, and there a taxicab was found.
 It carried  them farther north, and to the east still, until at last it came to a  halt before an apartment house that was rather imposing, set in a street  of humbler dwellings.
 Here, Garson paid the fare, and then helped  the girl to alight, and on into the hallway.
 Mary went with him quite  unafraid, though now with a growing curiosity.
 Strange as it all was,  she felt that she could trust this man who had plucked her from death,  who had worked over her with so much of tender kindliness.
 So, she  waited patiently; only, watched with intentness as he pressed the button  of a flat number.
 She observed with interest the thick, wavy gray of  his hair, which contradicted pleasantly the youthfulness of his  clean-shaven, resolute face, and the spare, yet well-muscled form.
    The clicking of the door-latch sounded soon, and the two entered, and  went slowly up three flights of stairs.
 On the landing beyond the third  flight, the door of a rear flat stood open, and in the doorway appeared  the figure of a woman.
    "Well, Joe, who's the skirt?" this person demanded, as the man and his  charge halted before her.
 Then, abruptly, the round, baby-like face of  the woman puckered in amazement.
 Her voice rose shrill.
 "My Gawd, if it  ain't Mary Turner!"    At that, the newcomer's eyes opened swiftly to their widest, and she  stared astounded in her turn.
    "Aggie!" she cried.
        .
 WITHIN THE LAW.
    In the time that followed, Mary lived in the flat which Aggie Lynch  occupied along with her brother, Jim, a pickpocket much esteemed among  his fellow craftsmen.
 The period wrought transformations of radical and  bewildering sort in both the appearance and the character of the girl.
  Joe Garson, the forger, had long been acquainted with Aggie and her  brother, though he considered them far beneath him in the social scale,  since their criminal work was not of that high kind on which he prided  himself.
 But, as he cast about for some woman to whom he might take the  hapless girl he had rescued, his thoughts fell on Aggie, and forthwith  his determination was made, since he knew that she was respectable,  viewed according to his own peculiar lights.
 He was relieved rather than  otherwise to learn that there was already an acquaintance between the  two women, and the fact that his charge had served time in prison did  not influence him one jot against her.
 On the contrary, it increased in  some measure his respect for her as one of his own kind.
 By the time he  had learned as well of her innocence, he had grown so interested  that even her folly, as he was inclined to deem it, did not cause any  wavering in his regard.
    Now, at last, Mary Turner let herself drift.
 It seemed to her that she  had abandoned herself to fate in that hour when she threw herself into  the river.
 Afterward, without any volition on her part, she had been  restored to life, and set within an environment new and strange to her,  in which soon, to her surprise, she discovered a vivid pleasure.
 So,  she fought no more, but left destiny to work its will unhampered by  her futile strivings.
 For the first time in her life, thanks to the  hospitality of Aggie Lynch, secretly reinforced from the funds of Joe  Garson, Mary found herself living in luxurious idleness, while her every  wish could be gratified by the merest mention of it.
 She was fed on the  daintiest of fare, for Aggie was a sybarite in all sensuous pleasures  that were apart from sex.
 She was clothed with the most delicate  richness for the first time as to those more mysterious garments which  women love, and she soon had a variety of frocks as charming as her  graceful form demanded.
 In addition, there were as many of books and  magazines as she could wish.
 Her mind, long starved like her body,  seized avidly on the nourishment thus afforded.
 In this interest, Aggie  had no share--was perhaps a little envious over Mary's absorption in  printed pages.
 But for her consolation were the matters of food and  dress, and of countless junketings.
 In such directions, Aggie was the  leader, an eager, joyous one always.
 She took a vast pride in her guest,  with the unmistakable air of elegance, and she dared to dream of great  triumphs to come, though as yet she carefully avoided any suggestion to  Mary of wrong-doing.
    In the end, the suggestion came from Mary Turner herself, to the great  surprise of Aggie, and, truth to tell, of herself.
    There were two factors that chiefly influenced her decision.
 The first  was due to the feeling that, since the world had rejected her, she  need no longer concern herself with the world's opinion, or retain any  scruples over it.
 Back of this lay her bitter sentiment toward the man  who had been the direct cause of her imprisonment, Edward Gilder.
 It  seemed to her that the general warfare against the world might well be  made an initial step in the warfare she meant to wage, somehow, some  time, against that man personally, in accordance with the hysterical  threat she had uttered to his face.
    The factor that was the immediate cause of her decision on an irregular  mode of life was an editorial in one of the daily newspapers.
 This was  a scathing arraignment of a master in high finance.
 The point of the  writer's attack was the grim sarcasm for such methods of thievery as are  kept within the law.
 That phrase held the girl's fancy, and she read the  article again with a quickened interest.
 Then, she began to meditate.
  She herself was in a curious, indeterminate attitude as far as concerned  the law.
 It was the law that had worked the ruin of her life, which she  had striven to make wholesome.
 In consequence, she felt for the law no  genuine respect, only detestation as for the epitome of injustice.
  Yet, she gave it a superficial respect, born of those three years of  suffering which had been the result of the penalty inflicted on her.
 It  was as an effect of this latter feeling that she was determined on one  thing of vital importance: that never would she be guilty of anything  to pit her against the law's decrees.
 She had known too many hours  of anguish in the doom set on her life because she had been deemed a  violator of the law.
 No, never would she let herself take any position  in which the law could accuse her.
.
.
.
 But there remained the fact that  the actual cause of her long misery was this same law, manipulated by  the man she hated.
 It had punished her, though she had been without  fault.
 For that reason, she must always regard it as her enemy, must,  indeed, hate it with an intensity beyond words--with an intensity equal  to that she bore the man, Gilder.
 Now, in the paragraph she had just  read she found a clue to suggestive thought, a hint as to a means by  which she might satisfy her rancor against the law that had outraged  her--and this in safety since she would attempt nought save that within  the law.
    Mary's heart leaped at the possibility back of those three words,  "within the law.
" She might do anything, seek any revenge, work any  evil, enjoy any mastery, as long as she should keep within the law.
  There could be no punishment then.
 That was the lesson taught by the  captain in high finance.
 He was at pains always in his stupendous  robberies to keep within the law.
 To that end, he employed lawyers of  mighty cunning and learning to guide his steps aright in such tortuous  paths.
    There, then, was the secret.
 Why should she not use the like means? Why,  indeed? She had brains enough to devise, surely.
 Beyond that, she  needed only to keep her course most carefully within those limits of  wrong-doing permitted by the statutes.
 For that, the sole requirement  would be a lawyer equally unscrupulous and astute.
 At once, Mary's mind  was made up.
 After all, the thing was absurdly simple.
 It was merely a  matter for ingenuity and for prudence in alliance.
.
.
.
 Moreover, there  would come eventually some adequate device against her arch-enemy,  Edward Gilder.
    Mary meditated on the idea for many days, and ever it seemed  increasingly good to her.
 Finally, it developed to a point where she  believed it altogether feasible, and then she took Joe Garson into  her confidence.
 He was vastly astonished at the outset and not quite  pleased.
 To his view, this plan offered merely a fashion of setting  difficulties in the way of achievement.
 Presently, however, the  sincerity and persistence of the girl won him over.
 The task of  convincing him would have been easier had he himself ever known the  torment of serving a term in prison.
 Thus far, however, the forger  had always escaped the penalty for his crimes, though often close to  conviction.
 But Mary's arguments were of a compelling sort as she set  them forth in detail, and they made their appeal to Garson, who was by  no means lacking in a shrewd native intelligence.
 He agreed that the  experiment should be made, notwithstanding the fact that he felt no  particular enthusiasm over the proposed scheme of working.
 It is likely  that his own strong feeling of attraction toward the girl whom he had  saved from death, who now appeared before him as a radiantly beautiful  young woman, was more persuasive than the excellent ideas which she  presented so emphatically, and with a logic so impressive.
    An agreement was made by which Joe Garson and certain of his more  trusted intimates in the underworld were to put themselves under the  orders of Mary concerning the sphere of their activities.
 Furthermore,  they bound themselves not to engage in any devious business without her  consent.
 Aggie, too, was one of the company thus constituted, but she  figured little in the preliminary discussions, since neither Mary nor  the forger had much respect for the intellectual capabilities of the  adventuress, though they appreciated to the full her remarkable powers  of influencing men to her will.
    It was not difficult to find a lawyer suited to the necessities of the  undertaking.
 Mary bore in mind constantly the high financier's reliance  on the legal adviser competent to invent a method whereby to baffle the  law at any desired point, and after judicious investigation she selected  an ambitious and experienced Jew named Sigismund Harris, just in the  prime of his mental vigors, who possessed a knowledge of the law only to  be equalled by his disrespect for it.
 He seemed, indeed, precisely  the man to fit the situation for one desirous of outraging the law  remorselessly, while still retaining a place absolutely within it.
    Forthwith, the scheme was set in operation.
 As a first step, Mary Turner  became a young lady of independent fortune, who had living with her a  cousin, Miss Agnes Lynch.
 The flat was abandoned.
 In its stead was an  apartment in the nineties on Riverside Drive, in which the ladies  lived alone with two maids to serve them.
 Garson had rooms in the  neighborhood, but Jim Lynch, who persistently refused the conditions  of such an alliance, betook himself afar, to continue his reckless  gathering of other folk's money in such wise as to make him amenable to  the law the very first time he should be caught at it.
    A few tentative ventures resulted in profits so large that the company  grew mightily enthusiastic over the novel manner of working.
 In each  instance, Harris was consulted, and made his confidential statement as  to the legality of the thing proposed.
 Mary gratified her eager mind  by careful studies in this chosen line of nefariousness.
 After a  few perfectly legal breach-of-promise suits, due to Aggie's winsome  innocence of demeanor, had been settled advantageously out of court,  Mary devised a scheme of greater elaborateness, with the legal acumen of  the lawyer to endorse it in the matter of safety.
    This netted thirty thousand dollars.
 It was planned as the swindling  of a swindler--which, in fact, had now become the secret principle in  Mary's morality.
    A gentleman possessed of some means, none too scrupulous himself, but  with high financial aspirations, advertised for a partner to invest  capital in a business sure to bring large returns.
 This advertisement  caught the eye of Mary Turner, and she answered it.
 An introductory  correspondence encouraged her to hope for the victory in a game of  cunning against cunning.
 She consulted with the perspicacious Mr.  Harris, and especially sought from him detailed information as to  partnership law.
 His statements gave her such confidence that presently  she entered into a partnership with the advertiser.
 By the terms  of their agreement, each deposited thirty thousand dollars to the  partnership account.
 This sum of sixty thousand dollars was ostensibly  to be devoted to the purchase of a tract of land, which should afterward  be divided into lots, and resold to the public at enormous profit.
 As  a matter of fact, the advertiser planned to make a spurious purchase  of the tract in question, by means of forged deeds granted by an  accomplice, thus making through fraud a neat profit of thirty thousand  dollars.
 The issue was, however, disappointing to him in the extreme.
 No  sooner was the sixty thousand dollars on deposit in the bank than Mary  Turner drew out the whole amount, as she had a perfect right to do  legally.
 When the advertiser learned of this, he was, naturally enough,  full to overflowing with wrath.
 But after an interview with Harris he  swallowed this wrath as best he might.
 He found that his adversary knew  a dangerous deal as to his various swindling operations.
 In short, he  could not go into court with clean hands, which is a prime stipulation  of the law--though often honored in the breach.
 But the advertiser's  hands were too perilously filthy, so he let himself be mulcted in raging  silence.
    The event established Mary as the arbiter in her own coterie.
 Here was,  in truth, a new game, a game most entertaining, and most profitable,  and not in the least risky.
 Immediately after the adventure with the  advertiser, Mary decided that a certain General Hastings would make an  excellent sacrifice on the altar of justice--and to her own financial  profit.
 The old man was a notorious roue, of most unsavory reputation  as a destroyer of innocence.
 It was probable that he would easily fall a  victim to the ingenuous charms of Aggie.
 As for that precocious damsel,  she would run no least risk of destruction by the satyr.
 So, presently,  there were elaborate plottings.
 General Hastings met Aggie in the  most casual way.
 He was captivated by her freshness and beauty, her  demureness, her ignorance of all things vicious.
 Straightway, he set his  snares, being himself already limed.
 He showered every gallant attention  on the naive bread-and-butter miss, and succeeded gratifyingly soon in  winning her heart--to all appearance.
 But he gained nothing more, for  the coy creature abruptly developed most effective powers of resistance  to every blandishment that went beyond strictest propriety.
 His ardor  cooled suddenly when Harris filed the papers in a suit for ten thousand  dollars damages for breach of promise.
    Even while this affair was still in the course of execution, Mary  found herself engaged in a direction that offered at least the hope  of attaining her great desire, revenge against Edward Gilder.
 This  opportunity came in the person of his son, Dick.
 After much contriving,  she secured an introduction to that young man.
 Forthwith, she showed  herself so deliciously womanly, so intelligent, so daintily feminine,  so singularly beautiful, that the young man was enamored almost at once.
  The fact thrilled Mary to the depths of her heart, for in this son of  the man whom she hated she saw the instrument of vengeance for which  she had so longed.
 Yet, this one thing was so vital to her that she said  nothing of her purposes, not even to Aggie, though that observant person  may have possessed suspicions more or less near the truth.
    It was some such suspicion that lay behind her speech as, in negligee,  she sat cross-legged on the bed, smoking a cigarette in a very knowing  way, while watching Mary, who was adjusting her hat before the mirror of  her dressing-table, one pleasant spring morning.
    "Dollin' up a whole lot, ain't you?" Aggie remarked, affably, with that  laxity of language which characterized her natural moods.
    "I have a very important engagement with Dick Gilder," Mary replied,  tranquilly.
 She vouchsafed nothing more definite as to her intentions.
    "Nice boy, ain't he?" Aggie ventured, insinuatingly.
    "Oh, I suppose so," came the indifferent answer from Mary, as she tilted  the picture hat to an angle a trifle more jaunty.
    The pseudo cousin sniffed.
    "You s'pose that, do you? Well, anyhow, he's here so much we ought to  be chargin' him for his meal-ticket.
 And yet I ain't sure that you even  know whether he's the real goods, or not.
"    The fair face of Mary Turner hardened the least bit.
 There shone an  expression of inscrutable disdain in the violet eyes, as she turned to  regard Aggie with a level glance.
    "I know that he's the son--the only son!--of Edward Gilder.
 The fact is  enough for me.
"    The adventuress of the demure face shook her head in token of complete  bafflement.
 Her rosy lips pouted in petulant dissatisfaction.
    "I don't get you, Mary," she admitted, querulously.
 "You never used to  look at the men.
 The way you acted when you first run round with me,  I thought you sure was a suffragette.
 And then you met this young  Gilder--and--good-night, nurse!"    The hardness remained in Mary's face, as she continued to regard her  friend.
 But, now, there was something quizzical in the glance with which  she accompanied the monosyllable:    "Well?"    Again, Aggie shook her head in perplexity.
    "His old man sends you up for a stretch for something you didn't do--and  you take up with his son like----"    "And yet you don't understand!" There was scorn for such gross stupidity  in the musical voice.
    Aggie choked a little from the cigarette smoke, as she gave a gasp when  suspicion of the truth suddenly dawned on her slow intelligence.
    "My Gawd!" Her voice came in a treble shriek of apprehension.
 "I'm  wise!"    "But you must understand this," Mary went on, with an authoritative  note in her voice.
 "Whatever may be between young Gilder and me is to be  strictly my own affair.
 It has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of  you, or with our schemes for money-making.
 And, what is more, Agnes, I  don't want to talk about it.
 But----"    "Yes?" queried Aggie, encouragingly, as the other paused.
 She hopefully  awaited further confidences.
    "But I do want to know," Mary continued with some severity, "what  you meant by talking in the public street yesterday with a common  pickpocket.
"    Aggie's childlike face changed swiftly its expression from a sly  eagerness to sullenness.
    "You know perfectly well, Mary Turner," she cried indignantly, "that  I only said a few words in passin' to my brother Jim.
 And he ain't no  common pickpocket.
 Hully Gee! He's the best dip in the business.
"    "But you must not be seen speaking with him," Mary directed, with a  certain air of command now become habitual to her among the members of  her clique.
 "My cousin, Miss Agnes Lynch, must be very careful as to her  associates.
"    The volatile Agnes was restored to good humor by some subtle quality in  the utterance, and a family pride asserted itself.
    "He just stopped me to say it's been the best year he ever had," she  explained, with ostentatious vanity.
    Mary appeared sceptical.
    "How can that be," she demanded, "when the dead line now is John  Street?"    "The dead line!" Aggie scoffed.
 A peal of laughter rang merrily from her  curving lips.
    "Why, Jim takes lunch every day in the Wall Street Delmonico's.
 Yes,"  she went on with increasing animation, "and only yesterday he went down  to Police Headquarters, just for a little excitement, 'cause Jim does  sure hate a dull life.
 Say, he told me they've got a mat at the  door with 'Welcome' on it--in letters three feet high.
 Now,  what--do--you--think--of that!" Aggie teetered joyously, the while  she inhaled a shockingly large mouthful of smoke.
 "And, oh, yes!"  she continued happily, "Jim, he lifted a leather from a bull who was  standing in the hallway there at Headquarters! Jim sure does love  excitement.
"    Mary lifted her dark eyebrows in half-amused inquiry.
    "It's no use, Agnes," she declared, though without entire sincerity; "I  can't quite keep up with your thieves' argot--your slang, you know.
 Just  what did this brother of yours do?"    "Why, he copped the copper's kale," Aggie translated, glibly.
    Mary threw out her hands in a gesture of dismay.
    Thereupon, the adventuress instantly assumed a most ladylike and mincing  air which ill assorted with the cigarette that she held between her  lips.
    "He gently removed a leathern wallet," she said sedately, "containing  a large sum of money from the coat pocket of a member of the detective  force.
" The elegance of utterance was inimitably done.
 But in the next  instant, the ordinary vulgarity of enunciation was in full play again.
  "Oh, Gee!" she cried gaily.
 "He says Inspector Burke's got a gold watch  that weighs a ton, an' all set with diamon's!--which was give to 'im  by--admirin' friends!.
.
.
 We didn't contribute.
"    "Given to him," Mary corrected, with a tolerant smile.
    Aggie sniffed once again.
    "What difference does it make?" she demanded, scornfully.
 "He's got it,  ain't he?" And then she added with avaricious intensity: "Just as soon  as I get time, I'm goin' after that watch--believe me!"    Mary shook her head in denial.
    "No, you are not," she said, calmly.
 "You are under my orders now.
 And  as long as you are working with us, you will break no laws.
"    "But I can't see----" Aggie began to argue with the petulance of a  spoiled child.
    Mary's voice came with a certainty of conviction born of fact.
    "When you were working alone," she said gravely, did you have a home  like this?"    "No," was the answer, spoken a little rebelliously.
    "Or such clothes? Most of all, did you have safety from the police?"    "No," Aggie admitted, somewhat more responsively.
 "But, just the same, I  can't see----"    Mary began putting on her gloves, and at the same time strove to give  this remarkable young woman some insight into her own point of view,  though she knew the task to be one well-nigh impossible.
    "Agnes," she said, didactically, "the richest men in this country have  made their fortunes, not because of the law, but in spite of the law.
  They made up their minds what they wanted to do, and then they engaged  lawyers clever enough to show them how they could do it, and still keep  within the law.
 Any one with brains can get rich in this country if he  will engage the right lawyer.
 Well, I have the brains--and Harris is  showing me the law--the wonderful twisted law that was made for the  rich! Since we keep inside the law, we are safe.
"    Aggie, without much apprehension of the exact situation, was moved to a  dimpled mirth over the essential humor of the method indicated.
    "Gee, that's funny," she cried happily.
 "You an' me an' Joe Garson  handin' it to 'em, an' the bulls can't touch us! Next thing you know,  Harris will be havin' us incorporated as the American Legal Crime  Society.
"    "I shouldn't be in the least surprised," Mary assented, as she finished  buttoning her gloves.
 She smiled, but there was a hint of grimness in  the bending of her lips.
 That grimness remained, as she glanced at  the clock, then went toward the door of the room, speaking over her  shoulder.
    "And, now I must be off to a most important engagement with Mr. Dick  Gilder.
"        .
 A TIP FROM HEADQUARTERS.
    Presently, when she had finished the cigarette, Aggie proceeded to her  own chamber and there spent a considerable time in making a toilette  calculated to set off to its full advantage the slender daintiness of  her form.
 When at last she was gowned to her satisfaction, she went  into the drawing-room of the apartment and gave herself over to more  cigarettes, in an easy chair, sprawled out in an attitude of comfort  never taught in any finishing school for young ladies.
 She at the same  time indulged her tastes in art and literature by reading the jokes and  studying the comic pictures in an evening paper, which the maid brought  in at her request.
 She had about exhausted this form of amusement when  the coming of Joe Garson, who was usually in and out of the apartment  a number of times daily, provided a welcome diversion.
 After a casual  greeting between the two, Aggie explained, in response to his question,  that Mary had gone out to keep an engagement with Dick Gilder.
    There was a little period of silence while the man, with the resolute  face and the light gray eyes that shone so clearly underneath the thick,  waving silver hair, held his head bent downward as if in intent thought.
  When, finally, he spoke, there was a certain quality in his voice that  caused Aggie to regard him curiously.
    "Mary has been with him a good deal lately," he said, half  questioningly.
    "That's what," was the curt agreement.
    Garson brought out his next query with the brutal bluntness of his kind;  and yet there was a vague suggestion of tenderness in his tones under  the vulgar words.
    "Think she's stuck on him?" He had seated himself on a settee opposite  the girl, who did not trouble on his account to assume a posture more  decorous, and he surveyed her keenly as he waited for a reply.
    "Why not?" Aggie retorted.
 "Bet your life I'd be, if I had a chance.
  He's a swell boy.
 And his father's got the coin, too.
"    At this the man moved impatiently, and his eyes wandered to the window.
  Again, Aggie studied him with a swift glance of interrogation.
 Not being  the possessor of an over-nice sensibility as to the feelings of others,  she now spoke briskly.
    "Joe, if there's anything on your mind, shoot it.
"    Garson hesitated for a moment, then decided to unburden himself, for he  craved precise knowledge in this matter.
    "It's Mary," he explained, with some embarrassment; "her and young  Gilder.
"    "Well?" came the crisp question.
    "Well, somehow," Garson went on, still somewhat confusedly, "I can't see  any good of it, for her.
"    "Why?" Aggie demanded, in surprise.
    Garson's manner grew easier, now that the subject was well broached.
    "Old man Gilder's got a big pull," he vouchsafed, "and if he caught on  to his boy's going with Mary, he'd be likely to send the police after  us--strong! Believe me, I ain't looking for any trip up the river.
"    Aggie shook her head, quite unaffected by the man's suggestion of  possible peril in the situation.
    "We ain't done nothin' they can touch us for," she declared, with  assurance.
 "Mary says so.
"    Garson, however, was unconvinced, notwithstanding his deference to the  judgment of his leader.
    "Whether we've done anything, or whether we haven't, don't matter," he  objected.
 "Once the police set out after you, they'll get you.
 Russia  ain't in it with some of the things I have seen pulled off in this  town.
"    "Oh, can that 'fraid talk!" Aggie exclaimed, roughly.
 "I tell you they  can't get us.
 We've got our fingers crossed.
"    She would have said more, but a noise at the hall door interrupted her,  and she looked up to see a man in the opening, while behind him appeared  the maid, protesting angrily.
    "Never mind that announcing thing with me," the newcomer rasped to the  expostulating servant, in a voice that suited well his thick-set figure,  with the bullet-shaped head and the bull-like neck.
 Then he turned to  the two in the drawing-room, both of whom had now risen to their feet.
    "It's all right, Fannie," Aggie said hastily to the flustered maid.
 "You  can go.
"    As the servant, after an indignant toss of the head, departed along the  passage, the visitor clumped heavily forward and stopped in the center  of the room, looking first at one and then the other of the two with a  smile that was not pleasant.
 He was not at pains to remove the derby  hat which he wore rather far back on his head.
 By this single sign, one  might have recognized Cassidy, who had had Mary Turner in his charge  on the occasion of her ill-fated visit to Edward Gilder's office, four  years before, though now the man had thickened somewhat, and his ruddy  face was grown even coarser.
    "Hello, Joe!" he cried, familiarly.
 "Hello, Aggie!"    The light-gray eyes of the forger had narrowed perceptibly as he  recognized the identity of the unceremonious caller, while the lines of  his firmly set mouth took on an added fixity.
    "Well?" he demanded.
 His voice was emotionless.
    "Just a little friendly call," Cassidy announced, in his strident voice.
  "Where's the lady of the house?"    "Out.
" It was Aggie who spoke, very sharply.
    "Well, Joe," Cassidy went on, without paying further heed to the girl  for a moment, "when she comes back, just tell her it's up to her to make  a get-away, and to make it quick.
"    But Aggie was not one to be ignored under any circumstances.
 Now, she  spoke with some acerbity in her voice, which could at will be wondrous  soft and low.
    "Say!" she retorted viciously, "you can't throw any scare into us.
 You  hadn't got anything on us.
 See?"    Cassidy, in response to this outburst, favored the girl with a long  stare, and there was hearty amusement in his tones as he answered.
    "Nothing on you, eh? Well, well, let's see.
" He regarded Garson with a  grin.
 "You are Joe Garson, forger.
" As he spoke, the detective took a  note-book from a pocket, found a page, and then read: "First arrested in  1891, for forging the name of Edwin Goodsell to a check for ten thousand  dollars.
 Again arrested June 19, 1893, for forgery.
 Arrested in April,  1898, for forging the signature of Oscar Hemmenway to a series of bonds  that were counterfeit.
 Arrested as the man back of the Reilly gang, in  1903.
 Arrested in 1908 for forgery.
"    There was no change in the face or pose of the man who listened to the  reading.
 When it was done, and the officer looked up with a resumption  of his triumphant grin, Garson spoke quietly.
    "Haven't any records of convictions, have you?"    The grin died, and a snarl sprang in its stead.
    "No," he snapped, vindictively.
 "But we've got the right dope on you,  all right, Joe Garson.
" He turned savagely on the girl, who now had  regained her usual expression of demure innocence, but with her  rather too heavy brows drawn a little lower than their wont, under the  influence of an emotion otherwise concealed.
    "And you're little Aggie Lynch," Cassidy declared, as he thrust the  note-book back into his pocket.
 "Just now, you're posing as Mary  Turner's cousin.
 You served two years in Burnsing for blackmail.
 You  were arrested in Buffalo, convicted, and served your stretch.
 Nothing on  you? Well, well!" Again there was triumph in the officer's chuckle.
    Aggie showed no least sign of perturbation in the face of  this revelation of her unsavory record.
 Only an expression of  half-incredulous wonder and delight beamed from her widely opened blue  eyes and was emphasized in the rounding of the little mouth.
    "Why," she cried, and now there was softness enough in the cooing notes,  "my Gawd! It looks as though you had actually been workin'!"    The sarcasm was without effect on the dull sensibilities of the officer.
  He went on speaking with obvious enjoyment of the extent to which his  knowledge reached.
    "And the head of the gang is Mary Turner.
 Arrested four years ago for  robbing the Emporium.
 Did her stretch of three years.
"    "Is that all you've got about her?" Garson demanded, with such  abruptness that Cassidy forgot his dignity sufficiently to answer with  an unqualified yes.
    The forger continued speaking rapidly, and now there was an undercurrent  of feeling in his voice.
    "Nothing in your record of her about her coming out without a friend  in the world, and trying to go straight? You ain't got nothing in that  pretty little book of your'n about your going to the millinery store  where she finally got a job, and tipping them off to where she come  from?"    "Sure, they was tipped off," Cassidy answered, quite unmoved.
 And he  added, swelling visibly with importance: "We got to protect the city.
"    "Got anything in that record of your'n," Garson went on venomously,  "about her getting another job, and your following her up again, and  having her thrown out? Got it there about the letter you had old Gilder  write, so that his influence would get her canned?"    "Oh, we had her right the first time," Cassidy admitted, complacently.
    Then, the bitterness of Garson's soul was revealed by the fierceness in  his voice as he replied.
    "You did not! She was railroaded for a job she never done.
 She went in  honest, and she came out honest.
"    The detective indulged himself in a cackle of sneering merriment.
    "And that's why she's here now with a gang of crooks," he retorted.
    Garson met the implication fairly.
    "Where else should she be?" he demanded, violently.
 "You ain't got  nothing in that record about my jumping into the river after her?" The  forger's voice deepened and trembled with the intensity of his emotion,  which was now grown so strong that any who listened and looked might  guess something of the truth as to his feeling toward this woman of whom  he spoke.
 "That's where I found her--a girl that never done nobody any  harm, starving because you police wouldn't give her a chance to work.
 In  the river because she wouldn't take the only other way that was left her  to make a living, because she was keeping straight!.
.
.
 Have you got any  of that in your book?"    Cassidy, who had been scowling in the face of this arraignment, suddenly  gave vent to a croaking laugh of derision.
    "Huh!" he said, contemptuously.
 "I guess you're stuck on her, eh?"    At the words, an instantaneous change swept over Garson.
 Hitherto, he  had been tense, his face set with emotion, a man strong and sullen,  with eyes as clear and heartless as those of a beast in the wild.
  Now, without warning, a startling transformation was wrought.
 His form  stiffened to rigidity after one lightning-swift step forward, and his  face grayed.
 The eyes glowed with the fires of a man's heart in a spasm  of hate.
 He was the embodiment of rage, as he spoke huskily, his voice a  whisper that was yet louder than any shout.
    "Cut that!"    The eyes of the two men locked.
 Cassidy struggled with all his pride  against the dominant fury this man hurled on him.
    "What?" he demanded, blusteringly.
 But his tone was weaker than its  wont.
    "I mean," Garson repeated, and there was finality in his accents, a  deadly quality that was appalling, "I mean, cut it out--now, here, and  all the time! It don't go!" The voice rose slightly.
 The effect of it  was more penetrant than a scream.
 "It don't go!.
.
.
 Do you get me?"    There was a short interval of silence, then the officer's eyes at last  fell.
 It was Aggie who relieved the tension of the scene.
    "He's got you," she remarked, airily.
 "Oi, oi! He's got you!"    There were again a few seconds of pause, and then Cassidy made an  observation that revealed in some measure the shock of the experience he  had just undergone.
    "You would have been a big man, Joe, if it hadn't been for that temper  of yours.
 It's got you into trouble once or twice already.
 Some time  it's likely to prove your finish.
"    Garson relaxed his immobility, and a little color crept into his cheeks.
    "That's my business," he responded, dully.
    "Anyway," the officer went on, with a new confidence, now that his eyes  were free from the gaze that had burned into his soul, "you've got to  clear out, the whole gang of you--and do it quick.
"    Aggie, who as a matter of fact began to feel that she was not receiving  her due share of attention, now interposed, moving forward till her face  was close to the detective's.
    "We don't scare worth a cent," she snapped, with the virulence of a  vixen.
 "You can't do anything to us.
 We ain't broke the law.
" There came  a sudden ripple of laughter, and the charming lips curved joyously, as  she added: "Though perhaps we have bent it a bit.
"    Cassidy sneered, outraged by such impudence on the part of an  ex-convict.
    "Don't make no difference what you've done," he growled.
 "Gee!" he went  on, with a heavy sneer.
 "But things are coming to a pretty pass when a  gang of crooks gets to arguing about their rights.
 That's funny, that  is!"    "Then laugh!" Aggie exclaimed, insolently, and made a face at the  officer.
 "Ha, ha, ha!"    "Well, you've got the tip," Cassidy returned, somewhat disconcerted,  after a stolid fashion of his own.
 "It's up to you to take it, that's  all.
 If you don't, one of you will make a long visit with some people  out of town, and it'll probably be Mary.
 Remember, I'm giving it to you  straight.
"    Aggie assumed her formal society manner, exaggerated to the point of  extravagance.
    "Do come again, little one," she chirruped, caressingly.
 "I've enjoyed  your visit so much!"    But Cassidy paid no apparent attention to her frivolousness; only turned  and went noisily out of the drawing-room, offering no return to her  daintily inflected good-afternoon.
    For her own part, as she heard the outer door close behind the  detective, Aggie's expression grew vicious, and the heavy brows drew  very low, until the level line almost made her prettiness vanish.
    "The truck-horse detective!" she sneered.
 "An eighteen collar, and a  six-and-a-half hat! He sure had his nerve, trying to bluff us!"    But it was plain that Garson was of another mood.
 There was anxiety in  his face, as he stood staring vaguely out of the window.
    "Perhaps it wasn't a bluff, Aggie," he suggested.
    "Well, what have we done, I'd like to know?" the girl demanded,  confidently.
 She took a cigarette and a match from the tabouret beside  her, and stretched her feet comfortably, if very inelegantly, on a chair  opposite.
    Garson answered with a note of weariness that was unlike him.
    "It ain't what you have done," he said, quietly.
 "It's what they can  make a jury think you've done.
 And, once they set out to get you--God,  how they can frame things! If they ever start out after Mary----" He did  not finish the sentence, but sank down into his chair with a groan that  was almost of despair.
    The girl replied with a burst of careless laughter.
    "Joe," she said gaily, "you're one grand little forger, all right, all  right.
 But Mary's got the brains.
 Pooh, I'll string along with her as  far as she wants to go.
 She's educated, she is.
 She ain't like you and  me, Joe.
 She talks like a lady, and, what's a damned sight harder,  she acts like a lady.
 I guess I know.
 Wake me up any old night and ask  me--just ask me, that's all.
 She's been tryin' to make a lady out of  me!"    The vivaciousness of the girl distracted the man for the moment from  the gloom of his thoughts, and he turned to survey the speaker with a  cynical amusement.
    "Swell chance!" he commented, drily.
    "Oh, I'm not so worse! Just you watch out.
" The lively girl sprang  up, discarded the cigarette, adjusted an imaginary train, and spoke  lispingly in a society manner much more moderate and convincing than  that with which she had favored the retiring Cassidy.
 Voice, pose and  gesture proclaimed at least the excellent mimic.
    "How do you do, Mrs. Jones! So good of you to call!.
.
.
 My dear Miss  Smith, this is indeed a pleasure.
" She seated herself again, quite  primly now, and moved her hands over the tabouret appropriately to her  words.
 "One lump, or two?.
.
.
 Yes, I just love bridge.
 No, I don't play,"  she continued, simpering; "but, just the same, I love it.
" With this  absurd ending, Aggie again arranged her feet according to her liking on  the opposite chair.
 "That's the kind of stuff she's had me doing," she  rattled on in her coarser voice, "and believe me, Joe, it's damned near  killing me.
 But all the same," she hurried on, with a swift revulsion  of mood to the former serious topic, "I'm for Mary strong! You stick to  her, Joe, and you'll wear diamon's.
.
.
.
 And that reminds me! I wish she'd  let me wear mine, but she won't.
 She says they're vulgar for an innocent  country girl like her cousin, Agnes Lynch.
 Ain't that fierce?.
.
.
 How can  anything be vulgar that's worth a hundred and fifty a carat?"        .
 A LEGAL DOCUMENT.
    Mary Turner spent less than an hour in that mysteriously important  engagement with Dick Gilder, of which she had spoken to Aggie.
 After  separating from the young man, she went alone down Broadway, walking the  few blocks of distance to Sigismund Harris's office.
 On a corner, her  attention was caught by the forlorn face of a girl crossing into the  side street.
 A closer glance showed that the privation of the gaunt  features was emphasized by the scant garments, almost in tatters.
  Instantly, Mary's quick sympathies were aroused, the more particularly  since the wretched child seemed of about the age she herself had been  when her great suffering had befallen.
 So, turning aside, she soon  caught up with the girl and spoke an inquiry.
    It was the familiar story, a father out of work, a sick mother, a brood  of hungry children.
 Some confused words of distress revealed the fact  that the wobegone girl was even then fighting the final battle of purity  against starvation.
 That she still fought on in such case proved enough  as to her decency of nature, wholesome despite squalid surroundings.
  Mary's heart was deeply moved, and her words of comfort came with a  simple sincerity that was like new life to the sorely beset waif.
 She  promised to interest herself in securing employment for the father,  such care as the mother and children might need, along with a proper  situation for the girl herself.
 In evidence of her purpose, she took her  engagement-book from her bag, and set down the street and number of the  East Side tenement where the family possessed the one room that  mocked the word home, and she gave a banknote to the girl to serve the  immediate needs.
    When she went back to resume her progress down Broadway, Mary felt  herself vastly cheered by the warm glow within, which is the reward of  a kindly act, gratefully received.
 And, on this particular morning, she  craved such assuagement of her spirit, for the conscience that, in  spite of all her misdeeds, still lived was struggling within her.
 In  her revolt against a world that had wantonly inflicted on her the worst  torments, Mary Turner had thought that she might safely disregard those  principles in which she had been so carefully reared.
 She had believed  that by the deliberate adoption of a life of guile within limits allowed  by the law, she would find solace for her wants, while feeling that thus  she avenged herself in some slight measure for the indignities she had  undergone unjustly.
 Yet, as the days passed, days of success as far as  her scheming was concerned, this brilliant woman, who had tried to deem  herself unscrupulous, found that lawlessness within the law failed to  satisfy something deep within her soul.
 The righteousness that was  her instinct was offended by the triumphs achieved through so devious  devices, though she resolutely set her will to suppress any spiritual  rebellion.
    There was, as well, another grievance of her nature, yet more subtle,  infinitely more painful.
 This lay in her craving for tenderness.
 She  was wholly woman, notwithstanding the virility of her intelligence,  its audacity, its aggressiveness.
 She had a heart yearning for the  multitudinous affections that are the prerogative of the feminine; she  had a heart longing for love, to receive and to give in full measure.
.
.
.
  And her life was barren.
 Since the death of her father, there had been  none on whom she could lavish the great gifts of her tenderness.
 Through  the days of her working in the store, circumstances had shut her out  from all association with others congenial.
 No need to rehearse the  impossibilities of companionship in the prison life.
 Since then, the  situation had not vitally improved, in spite of her better worldly  condition.
 For Garson, who had saved her from death, she felt a strong  and lasting gratitude--nothing that relieved the longing for nobler  affections.
 There was none other with whom she had any intimacy except  that, of a sort, with Aggie Lynch, and by no possibility could the  adventuress serve as an object of deep regard.
 The girl was amusing  enough, and, indeed, a most likable person at her best.
 But she was,  after all, a shallow-pated individual, without a shred of principle of  any sort whatsoever, save the single merit of unswerving loyalty to her  "pals.
" Mary cherished a certain warm kindliness for the first woman  who had befriended her in any way, but beyond this there was no finer  feeling.
    Nevertheless, it is not quite accurate to say that Mary Turner had had  no intimacy in which her heart might have been seriously engaged.
 In one  instance, of recent happening, she had been much in association with a  young man who was of excellent standing in the world, who was of good  birth, good education, of delightful manners, and, too, wholesome and  agreeable beyond the most of his class.
 This was Dick Gilder, and, since  her companionship with him, Mary had undergone a revulsion greater than  ever before against the fate thrust on her, which now at last she had  chosen to welcome and nourish by acquiescence as best she might.
    Of course, she could not waste tenderness on this man, for she had  deliberately set out to make him the instrument of her vengeance against  his father.
 For that very reason, she suffered much from a conscience  newly clamorous.
 Never for an instant did she hesitate in her  long-cherished plan of revenge against the one who had brought ruin on  her life, yet, through all her satisfaction before the prospect of final  victory after continued delay, there ran the secret, inescapable sorrow  over the fact that she must employ this means to attain her end.
 She had  no thought of weakening, but the better spirit within her warred against  the lust to repay an eye for an eye.
 It was the new Gospel against the  old Law, and the fierceness of the struggle rent her.
 Just now, the  doing of the kindly act seemed somehow to gratify not only her maternal  instinct toward service of love, but, too, to muffle for a little the  rebuking voice of her inmost soul.
    So she went her way more at ease, more nearly content again with herself  and with her system of living.
 Indeed, as she was shown into the private  office of the ingenious interpreter of the law, there was not a hint of  any trouble beneath the bright mask of her beauty, radiantly smiling.
    Harris regarded his client with an appreciative eye, as he bowed in  greeting, and invited her to a seat.
 The lawyer was a man of fine  physique, with a splendid face of the best Semitic type, in which were  large, dark, sparkling eyes--eyes a Lombroso perhaps might have judged  rather too closely set.
 As a matter of fact, Harris had suffered a  flagrant injustice in his own life from a suspicion of wrong-doing which  he had not merited by any act.
 This had caused him a loss of prestige in  his profession.
 He presently adopted the wily suggestion of the adage,  that it is well to have the game if you have the name, and he resolutely  set himself to the task of making as much money as possible by any means  convenient.
 Mary Turner as a client delighted his heart, both because of  the novelty of her ideas and for the munificence of the fees which she  ungrudgingly paid with never a protest.
 So, as he beamed on her now, and  spoke a compliment, it was rather the lawyer than the man that was moved  to admiration.
    "Why, Miss Turner, how charming!" he declared, smiling.
 "Really, my dear  young lady, you look positively bridal.
"    "Oh, do you think so?" Mary rejoined, with a whimsical pout, as she  seated herself.
 For the moment her air became distrait, but she quickly  regained her poise, as the lawyer, who had dropped back into his  chair behind the desk, went on speaking.
 His tone now was crisply  business-like.
    "I sent your cousin, Miss Agnes Lynch, the release which she is to  sign," he explained, "when she gets that money from General Hastings.
  I wish you'd look it over, when you have time to spare.
 It's all right,  I'm sure, but I confess that I appreciate your opinion of things,  Miss Turner, even of legal documents--yes, indeed, I do!--perhaps  particularly of legal documents.
"    "Thank you," Mary said, evidently a little gratified by the frank praise  of the learned gentleman for her abilities.
 "And have you heard from  them yet?" she inquired.
    "No," the lawyer replied.
 "I gave them until to-morrow.
 If I don't  hear then, I shall start suit at once.
" Then the lawyer's manner became  unusually bland and self-satisfied as he opened a drawer of the desk  and brought forth a rather formidable-appearing document, bearing a  most impressive seal.
 "You will be glad to know," he went on unctuously,  "that I was entirely successful in carrying out that idea of yours as to  the injunction.
 My dear Miss Turner," he went on with florid compliment,  "Portia was a squawking baby, compared with you.
"    "Thank you again," Mary answered, as she took the legal paper which he  held outstretched toward her.
 Her scarlet lips were curved happily, and  the clear oval of her cheeks blossomed to a deeper rose.
 For a moment,  her glance ran over the words of the page.
 Then she looked up at the  lawyer, and there were new lusters in the violet eyes.
    "It's splendid," she declared.
 "Did you have much trouble in getting  it?"    Harris permitted himself the indulgence of an unprofessional chuckle of  keenest amusement before he answered.
    "Why, no!" he declared, with reminiscent enjoyment in his manner.
 "That  is, not really!" There was an enormous complacency in his air over the  event.
 "But, at the outset, when I made the request, the judge just  naturally nearly fell off the bench.
 Then, I showed him that Detroit  case, to which you had drawn my attention, and the upshot of it all  was that he gave me what I wanted without a whimper.
 He couldn't help  himself, you know.
 That's the long and the short of it.
"    That mysterious document with the imposing seal, the request for which  had nearly caused a judge to fall off the bench, reposed safely in  Mary's bag when she, returned to the apartment after the visit to the  lawyer's office.
        .
 MARKED MONEY.
    Mary had scarcely received from Aggie an account of Cassidy's  threatening invasion, when the maid announced that Mr. Irwin had called.
    "Show him in, in just two minutes," Mary directed.
    "Who's the gink?" Aggie demanded, with that slangy diction which was her  habit.
    "You ought to know," Mary returned, smiling a little.
 "He's the  lawyer retained by General Hastings in the matter of a certain  breach-of-promise suit.
"    "Oh, you mean yours truly," Aggie exclaimed, not in the least abashed by  her forgetfulness in an affair that concerned herself so closely.
 "Hope  he's brought the money.
 What about it?"    "Leave the room now," Mary ordered, crisply.
 "When I call to you, come  in, but be sure and leave everything to me.
 Merely follow my lead.
 And,  Agnes--be very ingenue.
"    "Oh, I'm wise--I'm wise," Aggie nodded, as she hurried out toward her  bedroom.
 "I'll be a squab--surest thing you know!"    Next moment, Mary gave a formal greeting to the lawyer who represented  the man she planned to mulct effectively, and invited him to a chair  near her, while she herself retained her place at the desk, within a  drawer of which she had just locked the formidable-appearing document  received from Harris.
    Irwin lost no time in coming to the point.
    "I called in reference to this suit, which Miss Agnes Lynch threatens to  bring against my client, General Hastings.
"    Mary regarded the attorney with a level glance, serenely expressionless  as far as could be achieved by eyes so clear and shining, and her voice  was cold as she replied with significant brusqueness.
    "It's not a threat, Mr. Irwin.
 The suit will be brought.
"    The lawyer frowned, and there was a strident note in his voice when he  answered, meeting her glance with an uncompromising stare of hostility.
    "You realize, of course," he said finally, "that this is merely plain  blackmail.
"    There was not the change of a feature in the face of the woman who  listened to the accusation.
 Her eyes steadfastly retained their clear  gaze into his; her voice was still coldly formal, as before.
    "If it's blackmail, Mr. Irwin, why don't you consult the police?"  she inquired, with manifest disdain.
 Mary turned to the maid, who now  entered in response to the bell she had sounded a minute before.
 "Fanny,  will you ask Miss Lynch to come in, please?" Then she faced the lawyer  again, with an aloofness of manner that was contemptuous.
 "Really, Mr.  Irwin," she drawled, "why don't you take this matter to the police?"    The reply was uttered with conspicuous exasperation.
    "You know perfectly well," the lawyer said bitterly, "that General  Hastings cannot afford such publicity.
 His position would be  jeopardized.
"    "Oh, as for that," Mary suggested evenly, and now there was a trace of  flippancy in her fashion of speaking, "I'm sure the police would keep  your complaint a secret.
 Really, you know, Mr. Irwin, I think you had  better take your troubles to the police, rather than to me.
 You will get  much more sympathy from them.
"    The lawyer sprang up, with an air of sudden determination.
    "Very well, I will then," he declared, sternly.
 "I will!"    Mary, from her vantage point at the desk across from him, smiled a  smile that would have been very engaging to any man under more favorable  circumstances, and she pushed in his direction the telephone that stood  there.
    "3100, Spring," she remarked, encouragingly, "will bring an officer  almost immediately.
" She leaned back in her chair, and surveyed the  baffled man amusedly.
    The lawyer was furious over the failure of his effort to intimidate this  extraordinarily self-possessed young woman, who made a mock of his every  thrust.
 But he was by no means at the end of his resources.
    "Nevertheless," he rejoined, "you know perfectly well that General  Hastings never promised to marry this girl.
 You know----" He broke off  as Aggie entered the drawing-room,    Now, the girl was demure in seeming almost beyond belief, a childish  creature, very fair and dainty, guileless surely, with those untroubled  eyes of blue, those softly curving lips of warmest red and the more  delicate bloom in the rounded cheeks.
 There were the charms of innocence  and simplicity in the manner of her as she stopped just within the  doorway, whence she regarded Mary with a timid, pleading gaze, her  slender little form poised lightly as if for flight    "Did you want me, dear?" she asked.
 There was something half-plaintive  in the modulated cadences of the query.
    "Agnes," Mary answered affectionately, "this is Mr. Irwin, who has come  to see you in behalf of General Hastings.
"    "Oh!" the girl murmured, her voice quivering a little, as the lawyer,  after a short nod, dropped again into his seat; "oh, I'm so frightened!"  She hurried, fluttering, to a low stool behind the desk, beside Mary's  chair, and there she sank down, drooping slightly, and catching hold of  one of Mary's hands as if in mute pleading for protection against the  fear that beset her chaste soul.
    "Nonsense!" Mary exclaimed, soothingly.
 "There's really nothing at all  to be frightened about, my dear child.
" Her voice was that with which  one seeks to cajole a terrified infant.
 "You mustn't be afraid, Agnes.
  Mr. Irwin says that General Hastings did not promise to marry you.
 Of  course, you understand, my dear, that under no circumstances must you  say anything that isn't strictly true, and that, if he did not promise  to marry you, you have no case--none at all.
 Now, Agnes, tell me: did  General Hastings promise to marry you?"    "Oh, yes--oh, yes, indeed!" Aggie cried, falteringly.
 "And I wish he  would.
 He's such a delightful old gentleman!" As she spoke, the girl let  go Mary's hand and clasped her own together ecstatically.
    The legal representative of the delightful old gentleman scowled  disgustedly at this outburst.
 His voice was portentous, as he put a  question.
    "Was that promise made in writing?"    "No," Aggie answered, gushingly.
 "But all his letters were in writing,  you know.
 Such wonderful letters!" She raised her blue eyes toward  the ceiling in a naive rapture.
 "So tender, and so--er--interesting!"  Somehow, the inflection on the last word did not altogether suggest the  ingenuous.
    "Yes, yes, I dare say," Irwin agreed, hastily, with some evidences of  chagrin.
 He had no intention of dwelling on that feature of the letters,  concerning which he had no doubt whatsoever, since he knew the amorous  General very well indeed.
 They would be interesting, beyond shadow of  questioning, horribly interesting.
 Such was the confessed opinion of the  swain himself who had written them in his folly--horribly interesting  to all the reading public of the country, since the General was a  conspicuous figure.
    Mary intervened with a suavity that infuriated the lawyer almost beyond  endurance.
    "But you're quite sure, Agnes," she questioned gently, "that General  Hastings did promise to marry you?" The candor of her manner was  perfect.
    And the answer of Aggie was given with a like convincing emphasis.
    "Oh, yes!" she declared, tensely.
 "Why, I would swear to it.
" The limpid  eyes, so appealing in their soft lusters, went first to Mary, then gazed  trustingly into those of the routed attorney.
    "You see, Mr. Irwin, she would swear to that," emphasized Mary.
    "We're beaten," he confessed, dejectedly, turning his glance toward  Mary, whom, plainly, he regarded as his real adversary in the combat on  his client's behalf.
 "I'm going to be quite frank with you, Miss  Turner, quite frank," he stated with more geniality, though with a very  crestfallen air.
 Somehow, indeed, there was just a shade too much of  the crestfallen in the fashion of his utterance, and the woman whom he  addressed watched warily as he continued.
 "We can't afford any scandal,  so we're going to settle at your own terms.
" He paused expectantly, but  Mary offered no comment; only maintained her alert scrutiny of the  man.
 The lawyer, therefore, leaned forward with a semblance of frank  eagerness.
 Instantly, Aggie had become agog with greedily blissful  anticipations, and she uttered a slight ejaculation of joy; but Irwin  paid no heed to her.
 He was occupied in taking from his pocket a thick  bill-case, and from this presently a sheaf of banknotes, which he laid  on the desk before Mary, with a little laugh of discomfiture over having  been beaten in the contest.
    As he did so, Aggie thrust forth an avaricious hand, but it was caught  and held by Mary before it reached above the top of the desk, and the  avaricious gesture passed unobserved by the attorney.
    "We can't fight where ladies are concerned," he went on, assuming, as  best he might contrive, a chivalrous tone.
 "So, if you will just hand  over General Hastings' letters, why, here's your money.
"    Much to the speaker's surprise, there followed an interval of silence,  and his puzzlement showed in the knitting of his brows.
 "You have the  letters, haven't you?" he demanded, abruptly.
    Aggie coyly took a thick bundle from its resting place on her rounded  bosom.
    "They never leave me," she murmured, with dulcet passion.
 There was  in her voice a suggestion of desolation--a desolation that was the  blighting effect of letting the cherished missives go from her.
    "Well, they can leave you now, all right," the lawyer remarked  unsympathetically, but with returning cheerfulness, since he saw the end  of his quest in visible form before him.
 He reached quickly forward for  the packet, which Aggie extended willingly enough.
 But it was Mary who,  with a swift movement, caught and held it.
    "Not quite yet, Mr. Irwin, I'm afraid," she said, calmly.
    The lawyer barely suppressed a violent ejaculation of annoyance.
    "But there's the money waiting for you," he protested, indignantly.
    The rejoinder from Mary was spoken with great deliberation, yet with  a note of determination that caused a quick and acute anxiety to the  General's representative.
    "I think," Mary explained tranquilly, "that you had better see our  lawyer, Mr. Harris, in reference to this.
 We women know nothing of such  details of business settlement.
"    "Oh, there's no need for all that formality," Irwin urged, with a great  appearance of bland friendliness.
    "Just the same," Mary persisted, unimpressed, "I'm quite sure you would  better see Mr. Harris first.
" There was a cadence of insistence in her  voice that assured the lawyer as to the futility of further pretense on  his part.
    "Oh, I see," he said disagreeably, with a frown to indicate his complete  sagacity in the premises.
    "I thought you would, Mr. Irwin," Mary returned, and now she smiled in  a kindly manner, which, nevertheless, gave no pleasure to the chagrined  man before her.
 As he rose, she went on crisply: "If you'll take the  money to Mr. Harris, Miss Lynch will meet you in his office at four  o'clock this afternoon, and, when her suit for damages for breach  of promise has been legally settled out of court, you will get the  letters.
.
.
.
 Good-afternoon, Mr. Irwin.
"    The lawyer made a hurried bow which took in both of the women, and  walked quickly toward the door.
 But he was arrested before he reached  it by the voice of Mary, speaking again, still in that imperturbable  evenness which so rasped his nerves, for all its mellow resonance.
 But  this time there was a sting, of the sharpest, in the words themselves.
    "Oh, you forgot your marked money, Mr. Irwin," Mary said.
    The lawyer wheeled, and stood staring at the speaker with a certain  sheepishness of expression that bore witness to the completeness of his  discomfiture.
 Without a word, after a long moment in which he perceived  intently the delicate, yet subtly energetic, loveliness of this slender  woman, he walked back to the desk, picked up the money, and restored it  to the bill-case.
 This done, at last he spoke, with a new respect in his  voice, a quizzical smile on his rather thin lips.
    "Young woman," he said emphatically, "you ought to have been a lawyer.
"  And with that laudatory confession of her skill, he finally took  his departure, while Mary smiled in a triumph she was at no pains to  conceal, and Aggie sat gaping astonishment over the surprising turn of  events.
    It was the latter volatile person who ended the silence that followed on  the lawyer's going.
    "You've darn near broke my heart," she cried, bouncing up violently,  "letting all that money go out of the house.
.
.
.
 Say, how did you know it  was marked?"    "I didn't," Mary replied, blandly; "but it was a pretty good guess,  wasn't it? Couldn't you see that all he wanted was to get the letters,  and have us take the marked money? Then, my simple young friend, we  would have been arrested very neatly indeed--for blackmail.
"    Aggie's innocent eyes rounded in an amazed consternation, which was not  at all assumed.
    "Gee!" she cried.
 "That would have been fierce! And now?" she  questioned, apprehensively.
    Mary's answer repudiated any possibility of fear.
    "And now," she explained contentedly, "he really will go to our lawyer.
  There, he will pay over that same marked money.
 Then, he will get the  letters he wants so much.
 And, just because it's a strictly business  transaction between two lawyers, with everything done according to legal  ethics----"    "What's legal ethics?" Aggie demanded, impetuously.
 "They sound some  tasty!" With the comment, she dropped weakly into a chair.
    Mary laughed in care-free enjoyment, as well she might after winning the  victory in such a battle of wits.
    "Oh," she said, happily, "you just get it legally, and you get twice as  much!"    "And it's actually the same old game!" Aggie mused.
 She was doing her  best to get a clear understanding of the matter, though to her it was  all a mystery most esoteric.
    Mary reviewed the case succinctly for the other's enlightenment.
    "Yes, it's the same game precisely," she affirmed.
 "A shameless old roue  makes love to you, and he writes you a stack of silly letters.
"    The pouting lips of the listener took on a pathetic droop, and her voice  quivered as she spoke with an effective semblance of virginal terror.
    "He might have ruined my life!"    Mary continued without giving much attention to these histrionics.
    "If you had asked him for all this money for the return of his letters,  it would have been blackmail, and we'd have gone to jail in all human  probability.
 But we did no such thing--no, indeed! What we did wasn't  anything like that in the eyes of the law.
 What we did was merely to  have your lawyer take steps toward a suit for damages for breach of  promise of marriage for the sum of ten thousand dollars.
 Then, his  lawyer appears in behalf of General Hastings, and there follow a  number of conferences between the legal representatives of the opposing  parties.
 By means of these conferences, the two legal gentlemen run up  very respectable bills of expenses.
 In the end, we get our ten thousand  dollars, and the flighty old General gets back his letters.
.
.
.
 My dear,"  Mary concluded vaingloriously, "we're inside the law, and so we're  perfectly safe.
 And there you are!"          .
 THE THIEF.
    Mary remained in joyous spirits after her victorious matching of brains  against a lawyer of high standing in his profession.
 For the time being,  conscience was muted by gratified ambition.
 Her thoughts just then were  far from the miseries of the past, with their evil train of consequences  in the present.
 But that past was soon to be recalled to her with a  vividness most terrible.
    She had entered the telephone-booth, which she had caused to be  installed out of an extra closet of her bedroom for the sake of greater  privacy on occasion, and it was during her absence from the drawing-room  that Garson again came into the apartment, seeking her.
 On being told  by Aggie as to Mary's whereabouts, he sat down to await her return,  listening without much interest to the chatter of the adventuress.
.
.
.
 It  was just then that the maid appeared.
    "There's a girl wants to see Miss Turner," she explained.
    The irrepressible Aggie put on her most finically elegant air.
    "Has she a card?" she inquired haughtily, while the maid tittered  appreciation.
    "No," was the answer.
 "But she says it's important.
 I guess the poor  thing's in hard luck, from the look of her," the kindly Fannie added.
    "Oh, then she'll be welcome, of course," Aggie declared, and Garson  nodded in acquiescence.
 "Tell her to come in and wait, Fannie.
 Miss  Turner will be here right away.
" She turned to Garson as the maid left  the room.
 "Mary sure is an easy boob," she remarked, cheerfully.
 "Bless  her soft heart!"    A curiously gentle smile of appreciation softened the immobility of the  forger's face as he again nodded assent.
    "We might just as well pipe off the skirt before Mary gets here," Aggie  suggested, with eagerness.
    A minute later, a girl perhaps twenty years of age stepped just within  the doorway, and stood there with eyes downcast, after one swift,  furtive glance about her.
 Her whole appearance was that of dejection.
  Her soiled black gown, the cringing posture, the pallor of her face,  proclaimed the abject misery of her state.
    Aggie, who was not exuberant in her sympathies for any one other than  herself, addressed the newcomer with a patronizing inflection, modulated  in her best manner.
    "Won't you come in, please?" she requested.
    The shrinking girl shot another veiled look in the direction of the  speaker.
    "Are you Miss Turner?" she asked, in a voice broken by nervous dismay.
    "Really, I am very sorry," Aggie replied, primly; "but I am only her  cousin, Miss Agnes Lynch.
 But Miss Turner is likely to be back any  minute now.
"    "Can I wait?" came the timid question.
    "Certainly," Aggie answered, hospitably.
 "Please sit down.
"    As the girl obediently sank down on the nearest chair, Garson addressed  her sharply, so that the visitor started uneasily at the unexpected  sound.
    "You don't know Miss Turner?"    "No," came the faint reply.
    "Then, what do you want to see her about?"    There was a brief pause before the girl could pluck up courage enough  for an answer.
 Then, it was spoken confusedly, almost in a whisper.
    "She once helped a girl friend of mine, and I thought--I thought----"    "You thought she might help you," Garson interrupted.
    But Aggie, too, possessed some perceptive powers, despite the fact that  she preferred to use them little in ordinary affairs.
    "You have been in stir--prison, I mean.
" She hastily corrected the lapse  into underworld slang.
    Came a distressed muttering of assent from the girl.
    "How sad!" Aggie remarked, in a voice of shocked pity for one so  inconceivably unfortunate.
 "How very, very sad!"    This ingenuous method of diversion was put to an end by the entrance of  Mary, who stopped short on seeing the limp figure huddled in the chair.
    "A visitor, Agnes?" she inquired.
    At the sound of her voice, and before Aggie could hit on a fittingly  elegant form of reply, the girl looked up.
 And now, for the first  time, she spoke with some degree of energy, albeit there was a sinister  undertone in the husky voice.
    "You're Miss Turner?" she questioned.
    "Yes," Mary said, simply.
 Her words rang kindly; and she smiled  encouragement.
    A gasp burst from the white lips of the girl, and she cowered as one  stricken physically.
    "Mary Turner! Oh, my God! I----" She hid her face within her arms and  sat bent until her head rested on her knees in an abasement of misery.
    Vaguely startled by the hysterical outburst from the girl, Mary's  immediate thought was that here was a pitiful instance of one suffering  from starvation.
    "Joe," she directed rapidly, "have Fannie bring a glass of milk with an  egg and a little brandy in it, right away.
"    The girl in the chair was shaking soundlessly under the stress of her  emotions.
 A few disjointed phrases fell from her quivering lips.
    "I didn't know--oh, I couldn't!"    "Don't try to talk just now," Mary warned, reassuringly.
 "Wait until  you've had something to eat.
"    Aggie, who had observed developments closely, now lifted her voice in  tardy lamentations over her own stupidity.
 There was no affectation of  the fine lady in her self-reproach.
    "Why, the poor gawk's hungry!" she exclaimed! "And I never got the dope  on her.
 Ain't I the simp!"    The girl regained a degree of self-control, and showed something of  forlorn dignity.
    "Yes," she said dully, "I'm starving.
"    Mary regarded the afflicted creature with that sympathy born only of  experience.
    "Yes," she said softly, "I understand.
" Then she spoke to Aggie.
 "Take  her to my room, and let her rest there for a while.
 Have her drink the  egg and milk slowly, and then lie down for a few minutes anyhow.
"    Aggie obeyed with an air of bustling activity.
    "Sure, I will!" she declared.
 She went to the girl and helped her to  stand up.
 "We'll fix you out all right," she said, comfortingly.
 "Come  along with me.
.
.
.
 Hungry! Gee, but that's tough!"    Half an hour afterward, while Mary was at her desk, giving part of her  attention to Joe Garson, who sat near, and part to a rather formidable  pile of neatly arranged papers, Aggie reported with her charge, who,  though still shambling of gait, and stooping, showed by some faint color  in her face and an increased steadiness of bearing that the food had  already strengthened her much.
    "She would come," Aggie explained.
 "I thought she ought to rest for a  while longer anyhow.
" She half-shoved the girl into a chair opposite the  desk, in an absurd travesty on the maternal manner.
    "I'm all right, I tell you," came the querulous protest.
    Whereupon, Aggie gave over the uncongenial task of mothering, and  settled herself comfortably in a chair, with her legs merely crossed as  a compromise between ease and propriety.
    "Are you quite sure?" Mary said to the girl.
 And then, as the other  nodded in assent, she spoke with a compelling kindliness.
 "Then you  must tell us all about it--this trouble of yours, you know.
 What is your  name?"    Once again the girl had recourse to the swift, searching, furtive  glance, but her voice was colorless as she replied, listlessly:    "Helen Morris.
"    Mary regarded the girl with an expression that was inscrutable when she  spoke again.
    "I don't have to ask if you have been in prison," she said gravely.
  "Your face shows it.
"    "I--I came out--three months ago," was the halting admission.
    Mary watched the shrinking figure reflectively for a long minute before  she spoke again.
 Then there was a deeper resonance in her voice.
    "And you'd made up your mind to go straight?"    "Yes.
" The word was a whisper.
    "You were going to do what the chaplain had told you," Mary went on in  a voice vibrant with varied emotions.
 "You were going to start all over  again, weren't you? You were going to begin a new life, weren't you?"  The bent head of the girl bent still lower in assent.
 There came a  cynical note into Mary's utterance now.
    "It doesn't work very well, does it?" she asked, bitterly.
    The girl gave sullen agreement.
    "No," she said dully; "I'm whipped.
"    Mary's manner changed on the instant.
 She spoke cheerfully for the first  time.
    "Well, then," she questioned, "how would you like to work with us?"    The girl looked up for a second with another of her fleeting, stealthy  glances.
    "You--you mean that----?"    Mary explained her intention in the matter very explicitly.
 Her voice  grew boastful.
    "Our kind of work pays well when you know how.
 Look at us.
"    Aggie welcomed the opportunity for speech, too long delayed.
    "Hats from Joseph's, gowns from Lucile's, and cracked ice from  Tiffany's.
 But it ain't ladylike to wear it," she concluded with a  reproachful glance at her mentor.
    Mary disregarded the frivolous interruption, and went on speaking to the  girl, and now there was something pleasantly cajoling in her manner.
    "Suppose I should stake you for the present, and put you in with a good  crowd.
 All you would have to do would be to answer advertisements for  servant girls.
 I will see that you have the best of references.
 Then,  when you get in with the right people, you will open the front door some  night and let in the gang.
 Of course, you will make a get-away when they  do, and get your bit as well.
"    There flashed still another of the swift, sly glances, and the lips of  the girl parted as if she would speak.
 But she did not; only, her head  sagged even lower on her breast, and the shrunken form grew yet more  shrunken.
 Mary, watching closely, saw these signs, and in the same  instant a change came over her.
 Where before there had been an  underlying suggestion of hardness, there was now a womanly warmth of  genuine sympathy.
    "It doesn't suit you?" she said, very softly.
 "Good! I was in hopes it  wouldn't.
 So, here's another plan.
" Her voice had become very winning.
  "Suppose you could go West--some place where you would have a fair  chance, with money enough so you could live like a human being till you  got a start?"    There came a tensing of the relaxed form, and the head lifted a little  so that the girl could look at her questioner.
 And, this time, the  glance, though of the briefest, was less furtive.
    "I will give you that chance," Mary said simply, "if you really want  it.
"    That speech was like a current of strength to the wretched girl.
 She sat  suddenly erect, and her words came eagerly.
    "Oh, I do!" And now her hungry gaze remained fast on the face of the  woman who offered her salvation.
    Mary sprang up and moved a step toward the girl who continued to stare  at her, fascinated.
 She was now all wholesome.
 The memory of her  own wrongs surged in her during this moment only to make her more  appreciative of the blessedness of seemly life.
 She was moved to a  divine compassion over this waif for whom she might prove a beneficent  providence.
 There was profound conviction in the emphasis with which she  spoke her warning.
    "Then I have just one thing to say to you first.
 If you are going to  live straight, start straight, and then go through with it.
 Do you know  what that means?"    "You mean, keep straight all the time?" The girl spoke with a force  drawn from the other's strength.
    "I mean more than that," Mary went on earnestly.
 "I mean, forget that  you were ever in prison.
 I don't know what you have done--I don't think  I care.
 But whatever it was, you have paid for it--a pretty big price,  too.
" Into these last words there crept the pathos of one who knew.
 The  sympathy of it stirred the listener to fearful memories.
    "I have, I have!" The thin voice broke, wailing.
    "Well, then," Mary went on, "just begin all over again, and be sure you  stand up for your rights.
 Don't let them make you pay a second time.
 Go  where no one knows you, and don't tell the first people who are kind to  you that you have been crooked.
 If they think you are straight, why, be  it.
 Then nobody will have any right to complain.
" Her tone grew suddenly  pleading.
 "Will you promise me this?"    "Yes, I promise," came the answer, very gravely, quickened with hope.
    "Good!" Mary exclaimed, with a smile of approval.
 "Wait a minute," she  added, and left the room.
    "Huh! Pretty soft for some people," Aggie remarked to Garson, with a  sniff.
 She felt no alarm lest she wound the sensibilities of the girl.
  She herself had never let delicacy interfere between herself and money.
  It was really stranger that the forger, who possessed a more sympathetic  nature, did not scruple to speak an assent openly.
 Somehow, he felt an  inexplicable prejudice against this abject recipient of Mary's bounty,  though not for the world would he have checked the generous impulse on  the part of the woman he so revered.
 It was his instinct on her behalf  that made him now vaguely uneasy, as if he sensed some malign influence  against her there present with them.
    Mary returned soon.
 In her hand she carried a roll of bills.
 She went  to the girl and held out the money.
 Her voice was business-like now, but  very kind.
    "Take this.
 It will pay your fare West, and keep you quite a while if  you are careful.
"    But, without warning, a revulsion seized on the girl.
 Of a sudden, she  shrank again, and turned her head away, and her body trembled.
    "I can't take it," she stammered.
 "I can't! I can't!"    Mary stood silent for a moment from sheer amazement over the change.
  When she spoke, her voice had hardened a little.
 It is not agreeable to  have one's beneficence flouted.
    "Didn't you come here for help?" she demanded.
    "Yes," was the faltering reply, "but--but--I didn't know--it was you!"  The words came with a rush of desperation.
    "Then, you have met me before?" Mary said, quietly.
    "No, no!" The girl's voice rose shrill.
    Aggie spoke her mind with commendable frankness.
    "She's lying.
"    And, once again, Garson agreed.
 His yes was spoken in a tone of complete  certainty.
 That Mary, too, was of their opinion was shown in her next  words.
    "So, you have met me before? Where?"    The girl unwittingly made confession in her halting words.
    "I--I can't tell you.
" There was despair in her voice.
    "You must.
" Mary spoke with severity.
 She felt that this mystery held in  it something sinister to herself.
 "You must," she repeated imperiously.
    The girl only crouched lower.
    "I can't!" she cried again.
 She was panting as if in exhaustion.
    "Why can't you?" Mary insisted.
 She had no sympathy now for the girl's  distress, merely a great suspicious curiosity.
    "Because--because----" The girl could not go on.
    Mary's usual shrewdness came to her aid, and she put her next question  in a different direction.
    "What were you sent up for?" she asked briskly.
 "Tell me.
"    It was Garson who broke the silence that followed.
    "Come on, now!" he ordered.
 There was a savage note in his voice under  which the girl visibly winced.
 Mary made a gesture toward him that he  should not interfere.
 Nevertheless, the man's command had in it a  threat which the girl could not resist and she answered, though with  a reluctance that made the words seem dragged from her by some outside  force--as indeed they were.
    "For stealing.
"    "Stealing what?" Mary said.
    "Goods.
"    "Where from?"    A reply came in a breath so low that it was barely audible.
    "The Emporium.
"    In a flash of intuition, the whole truth was revealed to the woman who  stood looking down at the cowering creature before her.
    "The Emporium!" she repeated.
 There was a tragedy in the single word.
  Her voice grew cold with hate, the hate born of innocence long tortured.
  "Then you are the one who----"    The accusation was cut short by the girl's shriek.
    "I am not! I am not, I tell you.
"    For a moment, Mary lost her poise.
 Her voice rose in a flare of rage.
    "You are! You are!"    The craven spirit of the girl could struggle no more.
 She could only  sit in a huddled, shaking heap of dread.
 The woman before her had  been disciplined by sorrow to sternest self-control.
 Though racked by  emotions most intolerable, Mary soon mastered their expression to such  an extent that when she spoke again, as if in self-communion, her words  came quietly, yet with overtones of a supreme wo.
    "She did it!" Then, after a little, she addressed the girl with a  certain wondering before this mystery of horror.
 "Why did you throw the  blame on me?"    The girl made several efforts before her mumbling became intelligible,  and then her speech was gasping, broken with fear.
    "I found out they were watching me, and I was afraid they would catch  me.
 So, I took them and ran into the cloak-room, and put them in a  locker that wasn't close to mine, and some in the pocket of a coat that  was hanging there.
 God knows I didn't know whose it was.
 I just put them  there--I was frightened----"    "And you let me go to prison for three years!" There was a menace in  Mary's voice under which the girl cringed again.
    "I was scared," she whined.
 "I didn't dare to tell.
"    "But they caught you later," Mary went on inexorably.
 "Why didn't you  tell then?"    "I was afraid," came the answer from the shuddering girl.
 "I told them  it was the first time I had taken anything and they let me off with a  year.
"    Once more, the wrath of the victim flamed high.
    "You!" Mary cried.
 "You cried and lied, and they let you off with a  year.
 I wouldn't cry.
 I told the truth--and----" Her voice broke in a  tearless sob.
 The color had gone out of her face, and she stood rigid,  looking down at the girl whose crime had ruined her life with an  expression of infinite loathing in her eyes.
 Garson rose from his chair  as if to go to her, and his face passed swiftly from compassion to  ferocity as his gaze went from the woman he had saved from the river  to the girl who had been the first cause of her seeking a grave in the  waters.
 Yet, though he longed with every fiber of him to comfort the  stricken woman, he did not dare intrude upon her in this time of her  anguish, but quietly dropped back into his seat and sat watching with  eyes now tender, now baleful, as they shifted their direction.
    Aggie took advantage of the pause.
 Her voice was acid.
    "Some people are sneaks--just sneaks!"    Somehow, the speech was welcome to the girl, gave her a touch of courage  sufficient for cowardly protestations.
 It seemed to relieve the tension  drawn by the other woman's torment.
 It was more like the abuse that was  familiar to her.
 A gush of tears came.
    "I'll never forgive myself, never!" she moaned.
    Contempt mounted in Mary's breast.
    "Oh, yes, you will," she said, malevolently.
 "People forgive themselves  pretty easily.
" The contempt checked for a little the ravages of her  grief.
 "Stop crying," she commanded harshly.
 "Nobody is going to hurt  you.
" She thrust the money again toward the girl, and crowded it into  the half-reluctant, half-greedy hand.
    "Take it, and get out.
" The contempt in her voice rang still sharper,  mordant.
    Even the puling creature writhed under the lash of Mary's tones.
 She  sprang up, slinking back a step.
    "I can't take it!" she cried, whimpering.
 But she did not drop the  money.
    "Take the chance while you have it," Mary counseled, still with the  contempt that pierced even the hardened girl's sense of selfishness.
 She  pointed toward the door.
 "Go!--before I change my mind.
"    The girl needed, indeed, no second bidding.
 With the money still  clutched in her hand, she went forth swiftly, stumbling a little in her  haste, fearful lest, at the last moment, the woman she had so wronged  should in fact change in mood, take back the money--ay, even give her  over to that terrible man with the eyes of hate, to put her to death as  she deserved.
    Freed from the miasma of that presence, Mary remained motionless for a  long minute, then sighed from her tortured heart.
 She turned and went  slowly to her chair at the desk, and seated herself languidly, weakened  by the ordeal through which she had passed.
    "A girl I didn't know!" she said, bewilderedly; "perhaps had never  spoken to--who smashed my life like that! Oh, if it wasn't so awful, it  would be--funny! It would be funny!" A gust of hysterical laughter burst  from her.
 "Why, it is funny!" she cried, wildly.
 "It is funny!"    "Mary!" Garson exclaimed sharply.
 He leaped across the room to face her.
  "That's no good!" he said severely.
    Aggie, too, rushed forward.
    "No good at all!" she declared loudly.
    The interference recalled the distressed woman to herself.
 She made a  desperate effort for self-command.
 Little by little, the unmeaning look  died down, and presently she sat silent and moveless, staring at the two  with stormy eyes out of a wan face.
    "You were right," she said at last, in a lifeless voice.
 "It's done, and  can't be undone.
 I was a fool to let it affect me like that.
 I really  thought I had lost all feeling about it, but the sight of that girl--the  knowledge that she had done it--brought it all back to me.
 Well, you  understand, don't you?"    "We understand," Garson said, grimly.
 But there was more than grimness,  infinitely more, in the expression of his clear, glowing eyes.
    Aggie thought that it was her turn to voice herself, which she did  without undue restraint.
    "Perhaps, we do, but I dunno! I'll tell you one thing, though.
 If any  dame sent me up for three years and then wanted money from me, do you  think she'd get it? Wake me up any time in the night and ask me.
 Not  much--not a little bit much! I'd hang on to it like an old woman to her  last tooth.
" And that was Aggie's final summing up of her impressions  concerning the scene she had just witnessed.
        .
 A BRIDEGROOM SPURNED.
    After Aggie's vigorous comment there followed a long silence.
 That  volatile young person, little troubled as she was by sensitiveness,  guessed the fact that just now further discussion of the event would be  distasteful to Mary, and so she betook herself discreetly to a cigarette  and the illustrations of a popular magazine devoted to the stage.
 As for  the man, his reticence was really from a fear lest in speaking at all  he might speak too freely, might betray the pervasive violence of his  feeling.
 So, he sat motionless and wordless, his eyes carefully  avoiding Mary in order that she might not be disturbed by the invisible  vibrations thus sent from one to another.
 Mary herself was shaken to the  depths.
 A great weariness, a weariness that cried the worthlessness  of all things, had fallen upon her.
 It rested leaden on her soul.
 It  weighed down her body as well, though that mattered little indeed.
 Yet,  since she could minister to that readily, she rose and went to a settee  on the opposite side of the room where she arranged herself among the  cushions in a posture more luxurious than her rather precise early  training usually permitted her to assume in the presence of others.
  There she rested, and soon felt the tides of energy again flowing in  her blood, and that same vitality, too, wrought healing even for her  agonized soul, though more slowly.
 The perfect health of her gave her  strength to recover speedily from the shock she had sustained.
 It was  this health that made the glory of the flawless skin, white with a  living white that revealed the coursing blood beneath, and the crimson  lips that bent in smiles so tender, or so wistful, and the limpid  eyes in which always lurked fires that sometimes burst into flame, the  lustrous mass of undulating hair that sparkled in the sunlight like an  aureole to her face or framed it in heavy splendors with its shadows,  and the supple erectness of her graceful carriage, the lithe dignity of  her every movement.
    But, at last, she stirred uneasily and sat up.
 Garson accepted this as a  sufficient warrant for speech.
    "You know--Aggie told you--that Cassidy was up here from Headquarters.
  He didn't put a name to it, but I'm on.
" Mary regarded him inquiringly,  and he continued, putting the fact with a certain brutal bluntness  after the habit of his class.
 "I guess you'll have to quit seeing young  Gilder.
 The bulls are wise.
 His father has made a holler.
    "Don't let that worry you, Joe," she said tranquilly.
 She allowed a few  seconds go by, then added as if quite indifferent: "I was married to  Dick Gilder this morning.
" There came a squeal of amazement from Aggie,  a start of incredulity from Garson.
    "Yes," Mary repeated evenly, "I was married to him this morning.
 That  was my important engagement," she added with a smile toward Aggie.
 For  some intuitive reason, mysterious to herself, she did not care to meet  the man's eyes at that moment.
    Aggie sat erect, her baby face alive with worldly glee.
    "My Gawd, what luck!" she exclaimed noisily.
 "Why, he's a king fish, he  is.
 Gee! But I'm glad you landed him!"    "Thank you," Mary said with a smile that was the result of her sense of  humor rather than from any tenderness.
    It was then that Garson spoke.
 He was a delicate man in his  sensibilities at times, in spite of the fact that he followed devious  methods in his manner of gaining a livelihood.
 So, now, he put a  question of vital significance.
    "Do you love him?"    The question caught Mary all unprepared, but she retained her  self-control sufficiently to make her answer in a voice that to the  ordinary ear would have revealed no least tremor.
    "No," she said.
 She offered no explanation, no excuse, merely stated the  fact in all its finality.
    Aggie was really shocked, though for a reason altogether sordid, not one  whit romantic.
    "Ain't he young?" she demanded aggressively.
 "Ain't he good-looking, and  loose with his money something scandalous? If I met up with a fellow  as liberal as him, if he was three times his age, I could simply adore  him!"    It was Garson who pressed the topic with an inexorable curiosity born of  his unselfish interest in the woman concerned.
    "Then, why did you marry him?" he asked.
 The sincerity of him was excuse  enough for the seeming indelicacy of the question.
 Besides, he felt  himself somehow responsible.
 He had given back to her the gift of life,  which she had rejected.
 Surely, he had the right to know the truth.
    It seemed that Mary believed her confidence his due, for she told him  the fact.
    "I have been working and scheming for nearly a year to do it," she said,  with a hardening of her face that spoke of indomitable resolve.
 "Now,  it's done.
" A vindictive gleam shot from her violet eyes as she added:  "It's only the beginning, too.
"    Garson, with the keen perspicacity that had made him a successful  criminal without a single conviction to mar his record, had seized the  implication in her statement, and now put it in words.
    "Then, you won't leave us? We're going on as we were before?" The hint  of dejection in his manner had vanished.
 "And you won't live with him?"    "Live with him?" Mary exclaimed emphatically.
 "Certainly not!"    Aggie's neatly rounded jaw dropped in a gape of surprise that was most  unladylike.
    "You are going to live on in this joint with us?" she questioned,  aghast.
    "Of course.
" The reply was given with the utmost of certainty.
    Aggie presented the crux of the matter.
    "Where will hubby live?"    There was no lessening of the bride's composure as she replied, with a  little shrug.
    "Anywhere but here.
"    Aggie suddenly giggled.
 To her sense of humor there was something vastly  diverting in this new scheme of giving bliss to a fond husband.
    "Anywhere but here," she repeated gaily.
 "Oh, won't that be nice--for  him? Oh, yes! Oh, quite so! Oh, yes, indeed--quite so--so!"    Garson, however, was still patient in his determination to apprehend  just what had come to pass.
    "Does he understand the arrangement?" was his question.
    "No, not yet," Mary admitted, without sign of embarrassment.
    "Well," Aggie said, with another giggle, "when you do get around to tell  him, break it to him gently.
"    Garson was intently considering another phase of the situation, one  suggested perhaps out of his own deeper sentiments.
    "He must think a lot of you!" he said, gravely.
 "Don't he?"    For the first time, Mary was moved to the display of a slight confusion.
  She hesitated a little before her answer, and when she spoke it was in a  lower key, a little more slowly.
    "I--I suppose so.
"    Aggie presented the truth more subtly than could have been expected from  her.
    "Think a lot of you? Of course he does! Thinks enough to marry you! And  believe me, kid, when a man thinks enough of you to marry you, well,  that's some thinking!"    Somehow, the crude expression of this professional adventuress  penetrated to Mary's conscience, though it held in it the truth to which  her conscience bore witness, to which she had tried to shut her ears.
.
.
.
  And now from the man came something like a draught of elixir to her  conscience--like the trump of doom to her scheme of vengeance.
    Garson spoke very softly, but with an intensity that left no doubt as to  the honesty of his purpose.
    "I'd say, throw up the whole game and go to him, if you really care.
"    There fell a tense silence.
 It was broken by Mary herself.
 She spoke  with a touch of haste, as if battling against some hindrance within.
    "I married him to get even with his father," she said.
 "That's all there  is to it.
.
.
.
 By the way, I expect Dick will be here in a minute or two.
  When he comes, just remember not to--enlighten him.
"    Aggie sniffed indignantly.
    "Don't worry about me, not a mite.
 Whenever it's really wanted, I'm  always there with a full line of that lady stuff.
" Thereupon, she sprang  up, and proceeded to give her conception of the proper welcoming of the  happy bridegroom.
 The performance was amusing enough in itself, but for  some reason it moved neither of the two for whom it was rendered to  more than perfunctory approval.
 The fact had no depressing effect on the  performer, however, and it was only the coming of the maid that put her  lively sallies to an end.
    "Mr. Gilder," Fannie announced.
    Mary put a question with so much of energy that Garson began finally to  understand the depth of her vindictive feeling.
    "Any one with him?"    "No, Miss Turner," the maid answered.
    "Have him come in," Mary ordered.
    Garson felt that he would be better away for the sake of the newly  married pair at least, if not for his own.
 He made hasty excuses and  went out on the heels of the maid.
 Aggie, however, consulting only her  own wishes in the matter, had no thought of flight, and, if the truth be  told, Mary was glad of the sustaining presence of another woman.
    She got up slowly, and stood silent, while Aggie regarded her curiously.
  Even to the insensitive observer, there was something strange in the  atmosphere.
.
.
.
 A moment later the bridegroom entered.
    He was still clean-cut and wholesome.
 Some sons of wealthy fathers are  not, after four years experience of the white lights of town.
 And the  lines of his face were firmer, better in every way.
 It seemed, indeed,  that here was some one of a resolute character, not to be wasted on the  trivial and gross things.
 In an instant, he had gone to her, had caught  her in his arms with, "Hello, dear!" smothered in the kiss he implanted  on her lips.
    Mary strove vainly to free herself.
    "Don't, oh, don't!" she gasped.
    Dick Gilder released his wife from his arms and smiled the beatific  smile of the newly-wed.
    "Why not?" he demanded, with a smile, a smile calm, triumphant,  masterful.
    "Agnes!".
.
.
 It was the sole pretext to which Mary could turn for a  momentary relief.
    The bridegroom faced about, and perceived Agnes, who stood closely  watching the meeting between husband and wife.
 He made an excellent  formal bow of the sort that one learns only abroad, and spoke quietly.
    "I beg your pardon, Miss Lynch, but"--a smile of perfect happiness shone  on his face--"you could hardly expect me to see any one but Mary under  the circumstances.
 Could you?"    Aggie strove to rise to this emergency, and again took on her best  manner, speaking rather coldly.
    "Under what circumstances?" she inquired.
    The young man exclaimed joyously.
    "Why, we were married this morning.
"    Aggie accepted the news with fitting excitement.
    "Goodness gracious! How perfectly lovely!"    The bridegroom regarded her with a face that was luminous of delight.
    "You bet, it's lovely!" he declared with entire conviction.
 He turned to  Mary, his face glowing with satisfaction.
    "Mary," he said, "I have the honeymoon trip all fixed.
 The Mauretania  sails at five in the morning, so we will----"    A cold voice struck suddenly through this rhapsodizing.
 It was that of  the bride.
    "Where is your father?" she asked, without any trace of emotion.
    The bridegroom stopped short, and a deep blush spread itself over his  boyish face.
 His tone was filled full to overflowing with compunction as  he answered.
    "Oh, Lord! I had forgotten all about Dad.
" He beamed on Mary with a  smile half-ashamed, half-happy.
 "I'm awfully sorry," he said earnestly.
  "I'll tell you what we'll do.
 We'll send Dad a wireless from the ship,  then write him from Paris.
"    But the confident tone brought no response of agreement from Mary.
 On  the contrary, her voice was, if anything, even colder as she replied to  his suggestion.
 She spoke with an emphasis that brooked no evasion.
    "What was your promise? I told you that I wouldn't go with you until  you had brought your father to me, and he had wished us happiness.
" Dick  placed his hands gently on his wife's shoulders and regarded her with a  touch of indignation in his gaze.
    "Mary," he said reproachfully, "you are not going to hold me to that  promise?"    The answer was given with a decisiveness that admitted of no question,  and there was a hardness in her face that emphasized the words.
    "I am going to hold you to that promise, Dick.
"    For a few seconds, the young man stared at her with troubled eyes.
 Then  he moved impatiently, and dropped his hands from her shoulders.
 But his  usual cheery smile came again, and he shrugged resignedly.
    "All right, Mrs. Gilder," he said, gaily.
 The sound of the name provoked  him to new pleasure.
 "Sounds fine, doesn't it?" he demanded, with an  uxorious air.
    "Yes," Mary said, but there was no enthusiasm in her tone.
    The husband went on speaking with no apparent heed of his wife's  indifference.
    "You pack up what things you need, girlie," he directed.
 "Just a  few--because they sell clothes in Paris.
 And they are some class,  believe me! And meantime, I'll run down to Dad's office, and have him  back here in half an hour.
 You will be all ready, won't you?"    Mary answered quickly, with a little catching of her breath, but still  coldly.
    "Yes, yes, I'll be ready.
 Go and bring your father.
"    "You bet I will," Dick cried heartily.
 He would have taken her in his  arms again, but she evaded the caress.
 "What's the matter?" he demanded,  plainly at a loss to understand this repulse.
    "Nothing!" was the ambiguous answer.
    "Just one!" Dick pleaded.
    "No," the bride replied, and there was determination in the  monosyllable.
    It was evident that Dick perceived the futility of argument.
    "For a married woman you certainly are shy," he replied, with a sly  glance toward Aggie, who beamed back sympathy.
 "You'll excuse me, won't  you, Miss Lynch,.
.
.
 Good-by, Mrs. Gilder.
" He made a formal bow to his  wife.
 As he hurried to the door, he expressed again his admiration for  the name.
 "Mrs. Gilder! Doesn't that sound immense?" And with that he  was gone.
    There was silence in the drawing-room until the two women heard the  closing of the outer door of the apartment.
 Then, at last, Aggie  relieved her pent-up emotions in a huge sigh that was near a groan.
    "Oh Gawd!" she gasped.
 "The poor simp!"        .
 THE ADVENT OF GRIGGS.
    Later on, Garson, learning from the maid that Dick Gilder had left,  returned, just as Mary was glancing over the release, with which General  Hastings was to be compensated, along with the return of his letters,  for his payment of ten thousand dollars to Miss Agnes Lynch.
    "Hello, Joe," Mary said graciously as the forger entered.
 Then she spoke  crisply to Agnes.
 "And now you must get ready.
 You are to be at Harris's  office with this document at four o'clock, and remember that you are to  let the lawyer manage everything.
"    Aggie twisted her doll-like face into a grimace.
    "It gets my angora that I'll have to miss Pa Gilder's being led like  a lamb to the slaughter-house.
" And that was the nearest the little  adventuress ever came to making a Biblical quotation.
    "Anyhow," she protested, "I don't see the use of all this monkey  business here.
 All I want is the coin.
" But she hurried obediently,  nevertheless, to get ready for the start.
    Garson regarded Mary quizzically.
    "It's lucky for her that she met you," he said.
 "She's got no more  brains than a gnat.
"    "And brains are mighty useful things, even in our business," Mary  replied seriously; "particularly in our business.
"    "I should say they were," Garson agreed.
 "You have proved that.
"    Aggie came back, putting on her gloves, and cocking her small head very  primly under the enormous hat that was garnished with costliest plumes.
  It was thus that she consoled herself in a measure for the business of  the occasion--in lieu of cracked ice from Tiffany's at one hundred and  fifty a carat.
 Mary gave over the release, and Aggie, still grumbling,  deposited it in her handbag.
    "It seems to me we're going through a lot of red tape," she said  spitefully.
    Mary, from her chair at the desk, regarded the malcontent with a smile,  but her tone was crisp as she answered.
    "Listen, Agnes.
 The last time you tried to make a man give up part of  his money it resulted in your going to prison for two years.
"    Aggie sniffed, as if such an outcome were the merest bagatelle.
    "But that way was so exciting," she urged, not at all convinced.
    "And this way is so safe," Mary rejoined, sharply.
 "Besides, my dear,  you would not get the money.
 My way will.
 Your way was blackmail; mine  is not.
 Understand?"    "Oh, sure," Aggie replied, grimly, on her way to the door.
 "It's clear  as Pittsburgh.
" With that sarcasm directed against legal subtleties, she  tripped daintily out, an entirely ravishing vision, if somewhat garish  as to raiment, and soon in the glances of admiration that every man  cast on her guileless-seeming beauty, she forgot that she had ever been  annoyed.
    Garson's comment as she departed was uttered with his accustomed  bluntness.
    "Solid ivory!"    "She's a darling, anyway!" Mary declared, smiling.
 "You really don't  half-appreciate her, Joe!"    "Anyhow, I appreciate that hat," was the reply, with a dry chuckle.
    "Mr. Griggs," Fannie announced.
 There was a smile on the face of the  maid, which was explained a minute later when, in accordance with her  mistress's order, the visitor was shown into the drawing-room, for his  presence was of an elegance so extraordinary as to attract attention  anywhere--and mirth as well from ribald observers.
    Meantime, Garson had explained to Mary.
    "It's English Eddie--you met him once.
 I wonder what he wants? Probably  got a trick for me.
 We often used to work together.
"    "Nothing without my consent," Mary warned.
    "Oh, no, no, sure not!" Garson agreed.
    Further discussion was cut short by the appearance of English Eddie  himself, a tall, handsome man in the early thirties, who paused just  within the doorway, and delivered to Mary a bow that was the perfection  of elegance.
 Mary made no effort to restrain the smile caused by the  costume of Mr. Griggs.
 Yet, there was no violation of the canons of good  taste, except in the aggregate.
 From spats to hat, from walking coat  to gloves, everything was perfect of its kind.
 Only, there was an  over-elaboration, so that the ensemble was flamboyant.
 And the man's  manners precisely harmonized with his clothes, whereby the whole effect  was emphasized and rendered bizarre.
 Garson took one amazed look, and  then rocked with laughter.
    Griggs regarded his former associate reproachfully for a moment, and  then grinned in frank sympathy.
    "Really, Mr. Griggs, you quite overcome me," Mary said,  half-apologetically.
    The visitor cast a self-satisfied glance over his garb.
    "I think it's rather neat, myself.
" He had some reputation in the  under-world for his manner of dressing, and he regarded this latest  achievement as his masterpiece.
    "Sure some duds!" Garson admitted, checking his merriment.
    "From your costume," Mary suggested, "one might judge that this is  purely a social call.
 Is it?"    "Well, not exactly," Griggs answered with a smile.
    "So I fancied," his hostess replied.
 "So, sit down, please, and tell us  all about it.
"    While she was speaking, Garson went to the various doors, and made  sure that all were shut, then he took a seat in a chair near that which  Griggs occupied by the desk, so that the three were close together, and  could speak softly.
    English Eddie wasted no time in getting to the point.
    "Now, look here," he said, rapidly.
 "I've got the greatest game in the  world.
.
.
.
 Two years ago, a set of Gothic tapestries, worth three hundred  thousand dollars and a set of Fragonard panels, worth nearly as much  more, were plucked from a chateau in France and smuggled into this  country.
"    "I have never heard of that," Mary said, with some interest.
    "No," Griggs replied.
 "You naturally wouldn't, for the simple reason  that it's been kept on the dead quiet.
"    "Are them things really worth that much?" Garson exclaimed.
    "Sometimes more," Mary answered.
 "Morgan has a set of Gothic tapestries  worth half a million dollars.
"    Garson uttered an ejaculation of disgust.
    "He pays half a million dollars for a set of rugs!" There was a note of  fiercest bitterness come into his voice as he sarcastically concluded:  "And they wonder at crime!"    Griggs went on with his account.
    "About a month ago, the things I was telling you of were hung in the  library of a millionaire in this city.
" He hitched his chair a little  closer to the desk, and leaned forward, lowering his voice almost to a  whisper as he stated his plan.
    "Let's go after them.
 They were smuggled, mind you, and no matter what  happens, he can't squeal.
 What do you say?"    Garson shot a piercing glance at Mary.
    "It's up to her," he said.
 Griggs regarded Mary eagerly, as she sat with  eyes downcast.
 Then, after a little interval had elapsed in silence, he  spoke interrogatively:    "Well?"    Mary shook her head decisively.
 "It's out of our line," she declared.
    Griggs would have argued the matter.
 "I don't see any easier way to get  half a million," he said aggressively.
    Mary, however, was unimpressed.
    "If it were fifty millions, it would make no difference.
 It's against  the law.
"    "Oh, I know all that, of course," Griggs returned impatiently.
 "But if  you can----"    Mary interrupted him in a tone of finality.
    "My friends and I never do anything that's illegal! Thank you for  coming to us, Mr. Griggs, but we can't go in, and there's an end of the  matter.
"    "But wait a minute," English Eddie expostulated, "you see this chap,  Gilder, is----"    Mary's manner changed from indifference to sudden keen interest.
    "Gilder?" she exclaimed, questioningly.
    "Yes.
 You know who he is," Griggs answered; "the drygoods man.
"    Garson in his turn showed a new excitement as he bent toward Mary.
    "Why, it's old Gilder, the man you----"    Mary, however, had regained her self-control, for a moment rudely  shaken, and now her voice was tranquil again as she replied:    "I know.
 But, just the same, it's illegal, and I won't touch it.
 That's  all there is to it.
"    Griggs was dismayed.
    "But half a million!" he exclaimed, disconsolately.
 "There's a stake  worth playing for.
 Think of it!" He turned pleadingly to Garson.
 "Half a  million, Joe!"    The forger repeated the words with an inflection that was gloating.
    "Half a million!"    "And it's the softest thing you ever saw.
"    The telephone at the desk rang, and Mary spoke into it for a moment,  then rose and excused herself to resume the conversation over the wire  more privately in the booth.
 The instant she was out of the room, Griggs  turned to Garson anxiously.
    "It's a cinch, Joe," he pleaded.
 "I've got a plan of the house.
" He drew  a paper from his breast-pocket, and handed it to the forger, who seized  it avidly and studied it with intent, avaricious eyes.
    "It looks easy," Garson agreed, as he gave back the paper.
    "It is easy," Griggs reiterated.
 "What do you say?"    Garson shook his head in refusal, but there was no conviction in the  act.
    "I promised Mary never to----"    Griggs broke in on him.
    "But a chance like this! Anyhow, come around to the back room at  Blinkey's to-night, and we'll have a talk.
 Will you?"    "What time?" Garson asked hesitatingly, tempted.
    "Make it early, say nine," was the answer.
 "Will you?"    "I'll come," Garson replied, half-guiltily.
 And in the same moment Mary  reentered.
    Griggs rose and spoke with an air of regret.
    "It's 'follow the leader,'" he said, "and since you are against it, that  settles it.
"    "Yes, I'm against it," Mary said, firmly.
    "I'm sorry," English Eddie rejoined.
 "But we must all play the game  as we see it.
.
.
.
 Well, that was the business I was after, and, as it's  finished, why, good-afternoon, Miss Turner.
" He nodded toward Joe, and  took his departure.
    Something of what was in his mind was revealed in Garson's first speech  after Griggs's going.
    "That's a mighty big stake he's playing for.
"    "And a big chance he's taking!" Mary retorted.
 "No, Joe, we don't want  any of that.
 We'll play a game that's safe and sure.
"    The words recalled to the forger weird forebodings that had been  troubling him throughout the day.
    "It's sure enough," he stated, "but is it safe?"    Mary looked up quickly.
    "What do you mean?" she demanded.
    Garson walked to and fro nervously as he answered.
    "S'pose the bulls get tired of you putting it over on 'em and try some  rough work?"    Mary smiled carelessly.
    "Don't worry, Joe," she advised.
 "I know a way to stop it.
"    "Well, so far as that goes, so do I," the forger said, with significant  emphasis.
    "Just what do you mean by that?" Mary demanded, suspiciously.
    "For rough work," he said, "I have this.
" He took a magazine pistol from  his pocket.
 It was of an odd shape, with a barrel longer than is usual  and a bell-shaped contrivance attached to the muzzle.
    "No, no, Joe," Mary cried, greatly discomposed.
 "None of that--ever!"    The forger smiled, and there was malignant triumph in his expression.
    "Pooh!" he exclaimed.
 "Even if I used it, they would never get on to me.
  See this?" He pointed at the strange contrivance on the muzzle.
    Mary's curiosity made her forget for a moment her distaste.
    "What is it?" she asked, interestedly.
 "I have never seen anything like  that before.
"    "Of course you haven't," Garson answered with much pride.
 "I'm the first  man in the business to get one, and I'll bet on it.
 I keep up with the  times.
" For once, he was revealing that fundamental egotism which is the  characteristic of all his kind.
 "That's one of the new Maxim silencers,"  he continued.
 "With smokeless powder in the cartridges, and the silencer  on, I can make a shot from my coat-pocket, and you wouldn't even know it  had been done.
.
.
.
 And I'm some shot, believe me.
"    "Impossible!" Mary ejaculated.
    "No, it ain't," the man asserted.
 "Here, wait, I'll show you.
"    "Good gracious, not here!" Mary exclaimed in alarm.
 "We would have the  whole place down on us.
"    Garson chuckled.
    "You just watch that dinky little vase on the table across the room  there.
 'Tain't very valuable, is it?"    "No," Mary answered.
    In the same instant, while still her eyes were on the vase, it fell in  a cascade of shivered glass to the table and floor.
 She had heard no  sound, she saw no smoke.
 Perhaps, there had been a faintest clicking  noise.
 She was not sure.
 She stared dumfounded for a few seconds, then  turned her bewildered face toward Garson, who was grinning in high  enjoyment.
    "I would'nt have believed it possible," she declared, vastly impressed.
    "Neat little thing, ain't it?" the man asked, exultantly.
    "Where did you get it?" Mary asked.
    "In Boston, last week.
 And between you and me, Mary, it's the only  model, and it sure is a corker for crime.
"    The sinister association of ideas made Mary shudder, but she said no  more.
 She would have shuddered again, if she could have guessed the  vital part that pistol was destined to play.
 But she had no thought  of any actual peril to come from it.
 She might have thought otherwise,  could she have known of the meeting that night in the back room of  Blinkey's, where English Eddie and Garson sat with their heads close  together over a table.
    "A chance like this," Griggs was saying, "a chance that will make a  fortune for all of us.
"    "It sounds good," Garson admitted, wistfully.
    "It is good," the other declared with an oath.
 "Why, if this goes  through, we're set up for life.
 We can quit, all of us.
"    "Yes," Garson agreed, "we can quit, all of us.
" There was avarice in his  voice.
    The tempter was sure that the battle was won, and smiled contentedly.
    "Well," he urged, "what do you say?"    "How would we split it?" It was plain that Garson had given over the  struggle against greed.
 After all, Mary was only a woman, despite her  cleverness, and with all a woman's timidity.
 Here was sport for men.
    "Three ways would be right," Griggs answered.
 "One to me, one to you and  one to be divided up among the others.
"    Garson brought his fist down on the table with a force that made the  glasses jingle.
    "You're on," he said, strongly.
    "Fine!" Griggs declared, and the two men shook hands.
 "Now, I'll  get----"    "Get nothing!" Garson interrupted.
 "I'll get my own men.
 Chicago Red is  in town.
 So is Dacey, with perhaps a couple of others of the right sort.
  I'll get them to meet you at Blinkey's at two to-morrow afternoon, and,  if it looks right, we'll turn the trick to-morrow night.
"    "That's the stuff," Griggs agreed, greatly pleased.
    But a sudden shadow fell on the face of Garson.
 He bent closer to his  companion, and spoke with a fierce intensity that brooked no denial.
    "She must never know.
"    Griggs nodded understandingly.
    "Of course," he answered.
 "I give you my word that I'll never tell her.
  And you know you can trust me, Joe.
"    "Yes," the forger replied somberly, "I know I can trust you.
" But the  shadow did not lift from his face.
        .
 A WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT.
    Mary dismissed Garson presently, and betook herself to her bedroom for a  nap.
 The day had been a trying one, and, though her superb health could  endure much, she felt that both prudence and comfort required that she  should recruit her energies while there was opportunity.
 She was not  in the least surprised that Dick had not yet returned, though he had  mentioned half an hour.
 At the best, there were many things that might  detain him, his father's absence from the office, difficulties in making  arrangements for his projected honeymoon trip abroad--which would never  occur--or the like.
 At the worst, there was a chance of finding his  father promptly, and of that father as promptly taking steps to prevent  the son from ever again seeing the woman who had so indiscreetly married  him.
 Yet, somehow, Mary could not believe that her husband would yield  to such paternal coercion.
 Rather, she was sure that he would prove  loyal to her whom he loved, through every trouble.
 At the thought  a certain wistfulness pervaded her, and a poignant regret that this  particular man should have been the one chosen of fate to be entangled  within her mesh of revenge.
 There throbbed in her a heart-tormenting  realization that there were in life possibilities infinitely more  splendid than the joy of vengeance.
 She would not confess the truth even  to her inmost soul, but the truth was there, and set her a-tremble with  vague fears.
 Nevertheless, because she was in perfect health, and was  much fatigued, her introspection did not avail to keep her awake, and  within three minutes from the time she lay down she was blissfully  unconscious of all things, both the evil and the good, revenge and love.
    She had slept, perhaps, a half-hour, when Fannie awakened her.
    "It's a man named Burke," she explained, as her mistress lay blinking.
  "And there's another man with him.
 They said they must see you.
"    By this time, Mary was wide-awake, for the name of Burke, the Police  Inspector, was enough to startle her out of drowsiness.
    "Bring them in, in five minutes," she directed.
    She got up, slipped into a tea-gown, bathed her eyes in cologne, dressed  her hair a little, and went into the drawing-room, where the two men  had been waiting for something more than a quarter of an hour--to the  violent indignation of both.
    "Oh, here you are, at last!" the big, burly man cried as she entered.
  The whole air of him, though he was in civilian's clothes, proclaimed  the policeman.
    "Yes, Inspector," Mary replied pleasantly, as she advanced into the  room.
 She gave a glance toward the other visitor, who was of a slenderer  form, with a thin, keen face, and recognized him instantly as Demarest,  who had taken part against her as the lawyer for the store at the time  of her trial, and who was now holding the office of District Attorney.
  She went to the chair at the desk, and seated herself in a leisurely  fashion that increased the indignation of the fuming Inspector.
 She did  not trouble to ask her self-invited guests to sit.
    "To whom do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Inspector?" she remarked  coolly.
 It was noticeable that she said whom and not what, as if she  understood perfectly that the influence of some person brought him on  this errand.
    "I have come to have a few quiet words with you," the Inspector  declared, in a mighty voice that set the globes of the chandeliers  a-quiver.
 Mary disregarded him, and turned to the other man.
    "How do you do, Mr. Demarest?" she said, evenly.
 "It's four years since  we met, and they've made you District Attorney since then.
 Allow me to  congratulate you.
"    Demarest's keen face took on an expression of perplexity.
    "I'm puzzled," he confessed.
 "There is something familiar, somehow,  about you, and yet----" He scrutinized appreciatively the loveliness of  the girl with her classically beautiful face, that was still individual  in its charm, the slim graces of the tall, lissome form.
 "I should have  remembered you.
 I don't understand it.
"    "Can't you guess?" Mary questioned, somberly.
 "Search your memory, Mr.  Demarest.
"    Of a sudden, the face of the District Attorney lightened.
    "Why," he exclaimed, "you are--it can't be--yes--you are the girl,  you're the Mary Turner whom I--oh, I know you now.
"    There was an enigmatic smile bending the scarlet lips as she answered.
    "I'm the girl you mean, Mr. Demarest, but, for the rest, you don't know  me--not at all!"    The burly figure of the Inspector of Police, which had loomed motionless  during this colloquy, now advanced a step, and the big voice boomed  threatening.
 It was very rough and weighted with authority.
    "Young woman," Burke said, peremptorily, "the Twentieth Century Limited  leaves Grand Central Station at four o'clock.
 It arrives in Chicago at  eight-fifty-five to-morrow morning.
" He pulled a massive gold watch  from his waistcoat pocket, glanced at it, thrust it back, and concluded  ponderously: "You will just about have time to catch that train.
"    Mary regarded the stockily built officer with a half-amused contempt,  which she was at no pains to conceal.
    "Working for the New York Central now?" she asked blandly.
    The gibe made the Inspector furious.
    "I'm working for the good of New York City," he answered venomously.
    Mary let a ripple of cadenced laughter escape her.
    "Since when?" she questioned.
    A little smile twisted the lips of the District Attorney, but he caught  himself quickly, and spoke with stern gravity.
    "Miss Turner, I think you will find that a different tone will serve you  better.
"    "Oh, let her talk," Burke interjected angrily.
 "She's only got a few  minutes anyway.
"    Mary remained unperturbed.
    "Very well, then," she said genially, "let us be comfortable during that  little period.
" She made a gesture of invitation toward chairs, which  Burke disdained to accept; but Demarest seated himself.
    "You'd better be packing your trunk," the Inspector rumbled.
    "But why?" Mary inquired, with a tantalizing assumption of innocence.
  "I'm not going away.
"    "On the Twentieth Century Limited, this afternoon," the Inspector  declared, in a voice of growing wrath.
    "Oh, dear, no!" Mary's assertion was made very quietly, but with an  underlying firmness that irritated the official beyond endurance.
    "I say yes!" The answer was a bellow.
    Mary appeared distressed, not frightened.
 Her words were an ironic  protest against the man's obstreperous noisiness, no more.
    "I thought you wanted quiet words with me.
"    Burke went toward her, in a rage.
    "Now, look here, Mollie----" he began harshly.
    On the instant, Mary was on her feet, facing him, and there was a gleam  in her eyes as they met his that bade him pause.
    "Miss Turner, if you don't mind.
" She laughed slightly.
 "For the  present, anyway.
" She reseated herself tranquilly.
    Burke was checked, but he retained his severity of bearing.
    "I'm giving you your orders.
 You will either go to Chicago, or you'll go  up the river.
"    Mary answered in a voice charged with cynicism.
    "If you can convict me.
 Pray, notice that little word 'if'.
"    The District Attorney interposed very suavely.
    "I did once, remember.
"    "But you can't do it again," Mary declared, with an assurance that  excited the astonishment of the police official.
    "How do you know he can't?" he blustered.
    Mary laughed in a cadence of genial merriment.
    "Because," she replied gaily, "if he could, he would have had me in  prison some time ago.
"    Burke winced, but he made shift to conceal his realization of the truth  she had stated to him.
    "Huh!" he exclaimed gruffly.
 "I've seen them go up pretty easy.
"    Mary met the assertion with a serenity that was baffling.
    "The poor ones," she vouchsafed; "not those that have money.
 I have  money, plenty of money--now.
"    "Money you stole!" the Inspector returned, brutally.
    "Oh, dear, no!" Mary cried, with a fine show of virtuous indignation.
    "What about the thirty thousand dollars you got on that partnership  swindle?" Burke asked, sneering.
 "I s'pose you didn't steal that!"    "Certainly not," was the ready reply.
 "The man advertised for a partner  in a business sure to bring big and safe returns.
 I answered.
 The  business proposed was to buy a tract of land, and subdivide it.
 The  deeds to the land were all forged, and the supposed seller was  his confederate, with whom he was to divide the money.
 We formed a  partnership, with a capital of sixty thousand dollars.
 We paid the money  into the bank, and then at once I drew it out.
 You see, he wanted to get  my money illegally, but instead I managed to get his legally.
 For it was  legal for me to draw that money--wasn't it, Mr. Demarest?"    The District Attorney by an effort retained his severe expression of  righteous disapprobation, but he admitted the truth of her contention.
    "Unfortunately, yes," he said gravely.
 "A partner has the right to draw  out any, or all, of the partnership funds.
"    "And I was a partner," Mary said contentedly.
 "You, see, Inspector, you  wrong me--you do, really! I'm not a swindler; I'm a financier.
"    Burke sneered scornfully.
    "Well," he roared, "you'll never pull another one on me.
 You can gamble  on that!"    Mary permitted herself to laugh mockingly in the face of the badgered  official.
    "Thank you for telling me," she said, graciously.
 "And let me say,  incidentally, that Miss Lynch at the present moment is painlessly  extracting ten thousand dollars from General Hastings in a perfectly  legal manner, Inspector Burke.
"    "Well, anyhow," Burke shouted, "you may stay inside the law, but  you've got to get outside the city.
" He tried to employ an elephantine  bantering tone.
 "On the level, now, do you think you could get away with  that young Gilder scheme you've been planning?"    Mary appeared puzzled.
    "What young Gilder scheme?" she asked, her brows drawn in bewilderment.
    "Oh, I'm wise--I'm wise!" the Inspector cried roughly.
 "The answer is,  once for all, leave town this afternoon, or you'll be in the Tombs in  the morning.
"    Abruptly, a change came over the woman.
 Hitherto, she had been cynical,  sarcastic, laughing, careless, impudent.
 Now, of a sudden, she was all  seriousness, and she spoke with a gravity that, despite their volition,  impressed both the men before her.
    "It can't be done, Inspector," she said, sedately.
    The declaration, simple as it was, aroused the official to new  indignation.
    "Who says it can't?" he vociferated, overflowing with anger at this  flouting of the authority he represented.
    Mary opened a drawer of the desk, and took out the document obtained  that morning from Harris, and held it forth.
    "This," she replied, succinctly.
    "What's this?" Burke stormed.
 But he took the paper.
    Demarest looked over the Inspector's shoulder, and his eyes grew larger  as he read.
 When he was at an end of the reading, he regarded the  passive woman at the desk with a new respect.
    "What's this?" Burke repeated helplessly.
 It was not easy for him  to interpret the legal phraseology.
 Mary was kind enough to make the  document clear to him.
    "It's a temporary restraining order from the Supreme Court, instructing  you to let me alone until you have legal proof that I have broken the  law.
.
.
.
 Do you get that, Mr. Inspector Burke?"    The plethoric official stared hard at the injunction.
    "Another new one," he stuttered finally.
 Then his anger sought vent in  violent assertion.
 "But it can't be done!" he shouted.
    "You might ask Mr. Demarest," Mary suggested, pleasantly, "as to whether  or not it can be done.
 The gambling houses can do it, and so keep on  breaking the law.
 The race track men can do it, and laugh at the law.
  The railroad can do it, to restrain its employees from striking.
 So, why  shouldn't I get one, too? You see, I have money.
 I can buy all the law  I want.
 And there's nothing you can't do with the law, if you have money  enough.
.
.
.
 Ask Mr. Demarest.
 He knows.
"    Burke was fairly gasping over this outrage against his authority.
    "Can you beat that!" he rumbled with a raucously sonorous vehemence.
  He regarded Mary with a stare of almost reverential wonder.
 "A crook  appealing to the law!"    There came a new note into the woman's voice as she answered the gibe.
    "No, simply getting justice," she said simply.
 "That's the remarkable  part of it.
" She threw off her serious air.
 "Well, gentlemen," she  concluded, "what are you going to do about it?"    Burke explained.
    "This is what I'm going to do about it.
 One way or another, I'm going to  get you.
"    The District Attorney, however, judged it advisable to use more  persuasive methods.
    "Miss Turner," he said, with an appearance of sincerity, "I'm going to  appeal to your sense of fair play.
"    Mary's shining eyes met his for a long moment, and before the challenge  in hers, his fell.
 He remembered then those doubts that had assailed him  when this girl had been sentenced to prison, remembered the half-hearted  plea he had made in her behalf to Richard Gilder.
    "That was killed," Mary said, "killed four years ago.
"    But Demarest persisted.
 Influence had been brought to bear on him.
 It  was for her own sake now that he urged her.
    "Let young Gilder alone.
"    Mary laughed again.
 But there was no hint of joyousness in the musical  tones.
 Her answer was frank--brutally frank.
 She had nothing to conceal.
    "His father sent me away for three years--three years for something I  didn't do.
 Well, he's got to pay for it.
"    By this time, Burke, a man of superior intelligence, as one must be to  reach such a position of authority, had come to realize that here was  a case not to be carried through by blustering, by intimidation, by the  rough ruses familiar to the force.
 Here was a woman of extraordinary  intelligence, as well as of peculiar personal charm, who merely made  sport of his fulminations, and showed herself essentially armed against  anything he might do, by a court injunction, a thing unheard of until  this moment in the case of a common crook.
 It dawned upon him that this  was, indeed, not a common crook.
 Moreover, there had grown in him a  certain admiration for the ingenuity and resource of this woman, though  he retained all his rancor against one who dared thus to resist the duly  constituted authority.
 So, in the end, he spoke to her frankly, without  a trace of his former virulence, with a very real, if rugged, sincerity.
    "Don't fool yourself, my girl," he said in his huge voice, which was now  modulated to a degree that made it almost unfamiliar to himself.
 "You  can't go through with this.
 There's always a weak link in the chain  somewhere.
 It's up to me to find it, and I will.
"    His candor moved her to a like honesty.
    "Now," she said, and there was respect in the glance she gave the  stalwart man, "now you really sound dangerous.
"    There came an interruption, alike unexpected by all.
 Fannie appeared at  the door.
    "Mr. Edward Gilder wishes to see you, Miss Turner," she said, with no  appreciation of anything dynamic in the announcement.
 "Shall I show him  in?"    "Oh, certainly," Mary answered, with an admirable pretense of  indifference, while Burke glared at Demarest, and the District Attorney  appeared ill at ease.
    "He shouldn't have come," Demarest muttered, getting to his feet, in  reply to the puzzled glance of the Inspector.
    Then, while Mary sat quietly in her chair at the desk, and the two men  stood watching doubtfully the door, the maid appeared, stood aside, and  said simply, "Mr. Gilder.
"    There entered the erect, heavy figure of the man whom Mary had hated  through the years.
 He stopped abruptly just within the room, gave a  glance at the two men, then his eyes went to Mary, sitting at her desk,  with her face lifted inquiringly.
 He did not pause to take in the beauty  of that face, only its strength.
 He stared at her silently for a moment.
  Then he spoke in his oritund voice, a little tremulous from anxiety.
    "Are you the woman?" he said.
 There was something simple and primitive,  something of dignity beyond the usual conventions, in his direct  address.
    And there was the same primitive simplicity in the answer.
 Between the  two strong natures there was no subterfuge, no suggestion of polite  evasions, of tergiversation, only the plea of truth to truth.
 Mary's  acknowledgment was as plain as his own question.
    "I am the woman.
 What do you want?".
.
.
 Thus two honest folk had met face  to face.
    "My son.
" The man's answer was complete.
    But Mary touched a tragic note in her question.
 It was asked in no  frivolous spirit, but, of a sudden, she guessed that his coming  was altogether of his own volition, and not the result of his son's  information, as at first she had supposed.
    "Have you seen him recently?" she asked.
    "No," Gilder answered.
    "Then, why did you come?"    Thereat, the man was seized with a fatherly fury.
 His heavy face was  congested, and his sonorous voice was harsh with virtuous rebuke.
    "Because I intend to save my boy from a great folly.
 I am informed that  he is infatuated with you, and Inspector Burke tells me why--he tells  me--why--he tells me----" He paused, unable for a moment to continue  from an excess of emotion.
 But his gray eyes burned fiercely in  accusation against her.
    Inspector Burke himself filled the void in the halting sentence.
    "I told you she had been an ex-convict.
"    "Yes," Gilder said, after he had regained his self-control.
 He stared  at her pleadingly.
 "Tell me," he said with a certain dignity, "is this  true?"    Here, then, was the moment for which she had longed through weary days,  through weary years.
 Here was the man whom she hated, suppliant before  her to know the truth.
 Her heart quickened.
 Truly, vengeance is sweet to  one who has suffered unjustly.
    "Is this true?" the man repeated, with something of horror in his voice.
    "It is," Mary said quietly.
    For a little, there was silence in the room.
 Once, Inspector Burke  started to speak, but the magnate made an imperative gesture, and the  officer held his peace.
 Always, Mary rested motionless.
 Within her, a  fierce joy surged.
 Here was the time of her victory.
 Opposite her was  the man who had caused her anguish, the man whose unjust action had  ruined her life.
 Now, he was her humble petitioner, but this servility  could be of no avail to save him from shame.
 He must drink of the dregs  of humiliation--and then again.
 No price were too great to pay for a  wrong such as that which he had put upon her.
    At last, Gilder was restored in a measure to his self-possession.
 He  spoke with the sureness of a man of wealth, confident that money will  salve any wound.
    "How much?" he asked, baldly.
    Mary smiled an inscrutable smile.
    "Oh, I don't need money," she said, carelessly.
 "Inspector Burke will  tell you how easy it is for me to get it.
"    Gilder looked at her with a newly dawning respect; then his shrewdness  suggested a retort.
    "Do you want my son to learn what you are?" he said.
    Mary laughed.
 There was something dreadful in that burst of spurious  amusement.
    "Why not?" she answered.
 "I'm ready to tell him myself.
"    Then Gilder showed the true heart of him, in which love for his boy was  before all else.
 He found himself wholly at a loss before the woman's  unexpected reply.
    "But I don't want him to know," he stammered.
 "Why, I've spared the boy  all his life.
 If he really loves you--it will----"    At that moment, the son himself entered hurriedly from the hallway.
  In his eagerness, he saw no one save the woman whom he loved.
 At his  entrance, Mary rose and moved backward a step involuntarily, in  sheer surprise over his coming, even though she had known he must  come--perhaps from some other emotion, deeper, hidden as yet even from  herself.
    The young man, with his wholesome face alight with tenderness, went  swiftly to her, while the other three men stood silent, motionless,  abashed by the event.
 And Dick took Mary's hand in a warm clasp, pressed  it tenderly.
    "I didn't see father," he said happily, "but I left him a note on his  desk at the office.
"    Then, somehow, the surcharged atmosphere penetrated his consciousness,  and he looked around, to see his father standing grimly opposite him.
  But there was no change in his expression beyond a more radiant smile.
    "Hello, Dad!" he cried, joyously.
 "Then you got my note?"    The voice of the older man came with a sinister force and saturnine.
    "No, Dick, I haven't had any note.
"    "Then, why?" The young man broke off suddenly.
 He was become aware  that here was something malignant, with a meaning beyond his present  understanding, for he saw the Inspector and Demarest, and he knew the  two of them for what they were officially.
    "What are they doing here?" he demanded suspiciously, staring at the  two.
    "Oh, never mind them," Mary said.
 There was a malevolent gleam in her  violet eyes.
 This was the recompense of which she had dreamed through  soul-tearing ages.
 "Just tell your father your news, Dick.
"    The young man had no comprehension of the fact that he was only a pawn  in the game.
 He spoke with simple pride.
    "Dad, we're married.
 Mary and I were married this morning.
"    Always, Mary stared with her eyes steadfast on the father.
 There was  triumph in her gaze.
 This was the vengeance for which she had longed,  for which she had plotted, the vengeance she had at last achieved.
 Here  was her fruition, the period of her supremacy.
    Gilder himself seemed dazed by the brief sentence.
    "Say that again," he commanded.
    Mary rejoiced to make the knowledge sure.
    "I married your son this morning," she said in a matter-of-fact tone.
  "I married him.
 Do you quite understand, Mr. Gilder? I married him.
"  In that insistence lay her ultimate compensation for untold misery.
 The  father stood there wordless, unable to find speech against this calamity  that had befallen him.
    It was Burke who offered a diversion, a crude interruption after his own  fashion.
    "It's a frame-up," he roared.
 He glared at the young man.
 "Tell your  father it ain't true.
 Why, do you know what she is? She's done time.
" He  paused for an instant, then spoke in a voice that was brutally menacing.
  "And, by God, she'll do it again!"    The young man turned toward his bride.
 There was disbelief, hope,  despair, in his face, which had grown older by years with the passing of  the seconds.
    "It's a lie, Mary," he said.
 "Say it's a lie!" He seized her hand  passionately.
    There was no quiver in her voice as she answered.
 She drew her hand from  his clasp, and spoke evenly.
    "It's the truth.
"    "It's the truth!" the young man repeated, incredulously.
    "It is the truth," Mary said, firmly.
 "I have served three years in  prison.
"    There was a silence of a minute that was like years.
 It was the father  who broke it, and now his voice was become tremulous.
    "I wanted to save you, Dick.
 That's why I came.
"    The son interrupted him violently.
    "There's a mistake--there must be.
"    It was Demarest who gave an official touch to the tragedy of the moment.
    "There's no mistake," he said.
 There was authority in his statement.
    "There is, I tell you!" Dick cried, horrified by this conspiracy of  defamation.
 He turned his tortured face to his bride of a day.
    "Mary," he said huskily, "there is a mistake.
"    Something in her face appalled him.
 He was voiceless for a few terrible  instants.
 Then he spoke again, more beseechingly.
    "Say there's a mistake.
"    Mary preserved her poise.
 Yes--she must not forget! This was the hour of  her triumph.
 What mattered it that the honey of it was as ashes in her  mouth? She spoke with a simplicity that admitted no denial.
    "It's all quite true.
"    The man who had so loved her, so trusted her, was overwhelmed by the  revelation.
 He stood trembling for a moment, tottered, almost it seemed  would have fallen, but presently steadied himself and sank supinely into  a chair, where he sat in impotent suffering.
    The father looked at Mary with a reproach that was pathetic.
    "See," he said, and his heavy voice was for once thin with passion, "see  what you've done to my boy!"    Mary had held her eyes on Dick.
 There had been in her gaze a conflict of  emotions, strong and baffling.
 Now, however, when the father spoke,  her face grew more composed, and her eyes met his coldly.
 Her voice was  level and vaguely dangerous as she answered his accusation.
    "What is that compared to what you have done to me?"    Gilder stared at her in honest amazement.
 He had no suspicion as to the  tragedy that lay between him and her.
    "What have I done to you?" he questioned, uncomprehending.
    Mary moved forward, passing beyond the desk, and continued her advance  toward him until the two stood close together, face to face.
 She spoke  softly, but with an intensity of supreme feeling in her voice.
    "Do you remember what I said to you the day you had me sent away?"    The merchant regarded her with stark lack of understanding.
    "I don't remember you at all," he said.
    The woman looked at him intently for a moment, then spoke in a colorless  voice.
    "Perhaps you remember Mary Turner, who was arrested four years ago for  robbing your store.
 And perhaps you remember that she asked to speak to  you before they took her to prison.
"    The heavy-jowled man gave a start.
    "Oh, you begin to remember.
 Yes! There was a girl who swore she was  innocent--yes, she swore that she was innocent.
 And she would have got  off--only, you asked the judge to make an example of her.
"    The man to whom she spoke had gone gray a little.
 He began to  understand, for he was not lacking in intelligence.
 Somehow, it was  borne in on him that this woman had a grievance beyond the usual run of  injuries.
    "You are that girl?" he said.
 It was not a question, rather an  affirmation.
    Mary spoke with the dignity of long suffering--more than that, with the  confident dignity of a vengeance long delayed, now at last achieved.
  Her words were simple enough, but they touched to the heart of the man  accused by them.
    "I am that girl.
"    There was a little interval of silence.
 Then, Mary spoke again,  remorselessly.
    "You took away my good name.
 You smashed my life.
 You put me behind the  bars.
 You owe for all that.
.
.
.
 Well' I've begun to collect.
"    The man opposite her, the man of vigorous form, of strong face and  keen eyes, stood gazing intently for long moments.
 In that time, he was  learning many things.
 Finally, he spoke.
    "And that is why you married my boy.
"    "It is.
" Mary gave the answer coldly, convincingly.
    Convincingly, save to one--her husband.
 Dick suddenly aroused, and spoke  with the violence of one sure.
    "It is not!"    Burke shouted a warning.
 Demarest, more diplomatic, made a restraining  gesture toward the police official, then started to address the young  man soothingly.
    But Dick would have none of their interference.
    "This is my affair," he said, and the others fell silent.
 He stood up  and went to Mary, and took her two hands in his, very gently, yet very  firmly.
    "Mary," he said softly, yet with a strength of conviction, "you married  me because you love me.
"    The wife shuddered, but she strove to deny.
    "No," she said gravely, "no, I did not!"    "And you love me now!" he went on insistingly.
    "No, no!" Mary's denial came like a cry for escape.
    "You love me now!" There was a masterful quality in his declaration,  which seemed to ignore her negation.
    "I don't," she repeated bitterly.
    But he was inexorable.
    "Look me in the face, and say that.
"    He took her face in his hands, lifted it, and his eyes met hers  searchingly.
    "Look me in the face, and say that," he repeated.
    There was a silence that seemed long, though it was measured in the  passing of seconds.
 The three watchers dared not interrupt this drama  of emotions, but, at last, Mary, who had planned so long for this hour,  gathered her forces and spoke valiantly.
 Her voice was low, but without  any weakness of doubt.
    "I do not love you.
"    In the instant of reply, Dick Gilder, by some inspiration of love,  changed his attitude.
 "Just the same," he said cheerfully, "you are my  wife, and I'm going to keep you and make you love me.
"    Mary felt a thrill of fear through her very soul.
    "You can't!" she cried harshly.
 "You are his son!"    "She's a crook!" Burke said.
    "I don't care a damn what you've been!" Dick exclaimed.
 "From now  on you'll go straight.
 You'll walk the straightest line a woman ever  walked.
 You'll put all thoughts of vengeance out of your heart, because  I'll fill it with something bigger--I'm going to make you love me.
"    Burke, with his rousing voice, spoke again:    "I tell you, she's a crook!"    Mary moved a little, and then turned her face toward Gilder.
    "And, if I am, who made me one? You can't send a girl to prison, and  have her come out anything else.
"    Burke swung himself around in a movement of complete disgust.
    "She didn't get her time for good behavior.
"    Mary raised her head, haughtily, with a gesture of high disdain.
    "And I'm proud of it!" came her instant retort.
 "Do you know what goes  on there behind those stone walls? Do you, Mr. District Attorney, whose  business it is to send girls there? Do you know what a girl is expected  to do, to get time off for good behavior? If you don't, ask the  keepers.
"    Gilder moved fussily.
    "And you----"    Mary swayed a little, standing there before her questioner.
    "I served every minute of my time--every minute of it, three full, whole  years.
 Do you wonder that I want to get even, that some one has got to  pay? Four years ago, you took away my name--and gave me a number.
.
.
.
  Now, I've given up the number--and I've got your name.
"        .
 AFTERMATH OF TRAGEDY.
    The Gilders, both father and son, endured much suffering throughout the  night and day that followed the scene in Mary Turner's apartment, when  she had made known the accomplishment of her revenge on the older man  by her ensnaring of the younger.
 Dick had followed the others out of  her presence at her command, emphasized by her leaving him alone when  he would have pleaded further with her.
 Since then, he had striven to  obtain another interview with his bride, but she had refused him.
 He was  denied admission to the apartment.
 Only the maid answered the ringing of  the telephone, and his notes were seemingly unheeded.
 Distraught by this  violent interjection of torment into a life that hitherto had known no  important suffering, Dick Gilder showed what mettle of man lay beneath  his debonair appearance.
 And that mettle was of a kind worth while.
 In  these hours of grief, the soul of him put out its strength.
 He learned  beyond peradventure of doubt that the woman whom he had married was  in truth an ex-convict, even as Burke and Demarest had declared.
  Nevertheless, he did not for an instant believe that she was guilty of  the crime with which she had been originally charged and for which she  had served a sentence in prison.
 For the rest, he could understand in  some degree how the venom of the wrong inflicted on her had poisoned her  nature through the years, till she had worked out its evil through the  scheme of which he was the innocent victim.
 He cared little for the  fact that recently she had devoted herself to devious devices for making  money, to ingenious schemes for legal plunder.
 In his summing of her,  he set as more than an offset to her unrighteousness in this regard the  desperate struggle she had made after leaving prison to keep straight,  which, as he learned, had ended in her attempt at suicide.
 He knew  the intelligence of this woman whom he loved, and in his heart was  no thought of her faults as vital flaws.
 It seemed to him rather that  circumstances had compelled her, and that through all the suffering  of her life she had retained the more beautiful qualities of her  womanliness, for which he reverenced her.
 In the closeness of their  association, short as it had been, he had learned to know something  of the tenderer depths within her, the kindliness of her, the  wholesomeness.
 Swayed as he was by the loveliness of her, he was yet  more enthralled by those inner qualities of which the outer beauty was  only the fitting symbol.
    So, in the face of this catastrophe, where a less love must have been  destroyed utterly, Dick remained loyal.
 His passionate regard did not  falter for a moment.
 It never even occurred to him that he might cast  her off, might yield to his father's prayers, and abandon her.
 On the  contrary, his only purpose was to gain her for himself, to cherish and  guard her against every ill, to protect with his love from every attack  of shame or injury.
 He would not believe that the girl did not care  for him.
 Whatever had been her first purpose of using him only as an  instrument through which to strike against his father, whatever might  be her present plan of eliminating him from her life in the future, he  still was sure that she had grown to know a real and lasting affection  for himself.
 He remembered startled glances from the violet eyes, caught  unawares, and the music of her voice in rare instants, and these told  him that love for him stirred, even though it might as yet be but  faintly, in her heart.
    Out of that fact, he drew an immediate comfort in this period of his  misery.
 Nevertheless, his anguish was a racking one.
 He grew older  visibly in the night and the day.
 There crept suddenly lines of new  feeling into his face, and, too, lines of new strength.
 The boy died in  that time; the man was born, came forth in the full of his steadfastness  and his courage, and his love.
    The father suffered with the son.
 He was a proud man, intensely  gratified over the commanding position to which he had achieved in the  commercial world, proud of his business integrity, of his standing in  the community as a leader, proud of his social position, proud most of  all of the son whom he so loved.
 Now, this hideous disaster threatened  his pride at every turn--worse, it threatened the one person in the  world whom he really loved.
 Most fathers would have stormed at the boy  when pleading failed, would have given commands with harshness, would  have menaced the recalcitrant with disinheritance.
 Edward Gilder did  none of these things, though his heart was sorely wounded.
 He loved  his son too much to contemplate making more evil for the lad by any  estrangement between them.
 Yet he felt that the matter could not safely  be left in the hands of Dick himself.
 He realized that his son loved  the woman--nor could he wonder much at that.
 His keen eyes had  perceived Mary Turner's graces of form, her loveliness of face.
 He had  apprehended, too, in some measure at least, the fineness of her mental  fiber and the capacities of her heart.
 Deep within him, denied any  outlet, he knew there lurked a curious, subtle sympathy for the girl in  her scheme of revenge against himself.
 Her persistent striving toward  the object of her ambition was something he could understand, since the  like thing in different guise had been back of his own business success.
  He would not let the idea rise to the surface of consciousness, for  he still refused to believe that Mary Turner had suffered at his hand  unjustly.
 He would think of her as nothing else than a vile creature,  who had caught his son in the toils of her beauty and charm, for the  purpose of eventually making money out of the intrigue.
    Gilder, in his library this night, was pacing impatiently to and fro,  eagerly listening for the sound of his son's return to the house.
 He had  been the guest of honor that night at an important meeting of the Civic  Committee, and he had spoken with his usual clarity and earnestness in  spite of the trouble that beset him.
 Now, however, the regeneration of  the city was far from his thought, and his sole concern was with the  regeneration of a life, that of his son, which bade fair to be ruined by  the wiles of a wicked woman.
 He was anxious for the coming of Dick, to  whom he would make one more appeal.
 If that should fail--well, he must  use the influences at his command to secure the forcible parting of the  adventuress from his son.
    The room in which he paced to and fro was of a solid dignity, well  fitted to serve as an environment for its owner.
 It was very large, and  lofty.
 There was massiveness in the desk that stood opposite the hall  door, near a window.
 This particular window itself was huge, high,  jutting in octagonal, with leaded panes.
 In addition, there was a great  fireplace set with tiles, around which was woodwork elaborately carved,  the fruit of patient questing abroad.
 On the walls were hung some pieces  of tapestry, where there were not bookcases.
 Over the octagonal window,  too, such draperies fell in stately lines.
 Now, as the magnate paced  back and forth, there was only a gentle light in the room, from a  reading-lamp on his desk.
 The huge chandelier was unlighted.
.
.
.
 It was  even as Gilder, in an increasing irritation over the delay, had thrown  himself down on a couch which stood just a little way within an alcove,  that he heard the outer door open and shut.
 He sprang up with an  ejaculation of satisfaction.
    "Dick, at last!" he muttered.
    It was, in truth, the son.
 A moment later, he entered the room, and went  at once to his father, who was standing waiting, facing the door.
    "I'm awfully sorry I'm so late, Dad," he said simply.
    "Where have you been?" the father demanded gravely.
 But there was great  affection in the flash of his gray eyes as he scanned the young man's  face, and the touch of the hand that he put on Dick's shoulder was very  tender.
 "With that woman again?"    The boy's voice was disconsolate as he replied:    "No, father, not with her.
 She won't see me.
"    The older man snorted a wrathful appreciation.
    "Naturally!" he exclaimed with exceeding bitterness in the heavy voice.
  "She's got all she wanted from you--my name!" He repeated the words with  a grimace of exasperation: "My name!"    There was a novel dignity in the son's tone as he spoke.
    "It's mine, too, you know, sir," he said quietly.
    The father was impressed of a sudden with the fact that, while this  affair was of supreme import to himself, it was, after all, of still  greater significance to his son.
 To himself, the chief concerns were  of the worldly kind.
 To this boy, the vital thing was something deeper,  something of the heart: for, however absurd his feeling, the truth  remained that he loved the woman.
 Yes, it was the son's name that Mary  Turner had taken, as well as that of his father.
 In the case of the son,  she had taken not only his name, but his very life.
 Yes, it was, indeed,  Dick's tragedy.
 Whatever he, the father, might feel, the son was, after  all, more affected.
 He must suffer more, must lose more, must pay more  with happiness for his folly.
    Gilder looked at his son with a strange, new respect, but he could not  let the situation go without protest, protest of the most vehement.
    "Dick," he cried, and his big voice was shaken a little by the force  of his emotion; "boy, you are all I have in the world.
 You will have  to free yourself from this woman somehow.
" He stood very erect, staring  steadfastly out of his clear gray eyes into those of his son.
 His heavy  face was rigid with feeling; the coarse mouth bent slightly in a smile  of troubled fondness, as he added more softly: "You owe me that much.
"    The son's eyes met his father's freely.
 There was respect in them, and  affection, but there was something else, too, something the older man  recognized as beyond his control.
 He spoke gravely, with a deliberate  conviction.
    "I owe something to her, too, Dad.
"    But Gilder would not let the statement go unchallenged.
 His heavy voice  rang out rebukingly, overtoned with protest.
    "What can you owe her?" he demanded indignantly.
 "She tricked you into  the marriage.
 Why, legally, it's not even that.
 There's been nothing  more than a wedding ceremony.
 The courts hold that that is only a part  of the marriage actually.
 The fact that she doesn't receive you makes it  simpler, too.
 It can be arranged.
 We must get you out of the scrape.
"    He turned and went to the desk, as if to sit, but he was halted by his  son's answer, given very gently, yet with a note of finality that to the  father's ear rang like the crack of doom.
    "I'm not sure that I want to get out of it, father.
"    That was all, but those plain words summed the situation, made the issue  a matter not of advice, but of the heart.
    Gilder persisted, however, in trying to evade the integral fact of his  son's feeling.
 Still he tried to fix the issue on the known unsavory  reputation of the woman.
    "You want to stay married to this jail-bird!" he stormed.
    A gust of fury swept the boy.
 He loved the woman, in spite of all; he  respected her, even reverenced her.
 To hear her thus named moved him to  a rage almost beyond his control.
 But he mastered himself.
 He remembered  that the man who spoke loved him; he remembered, too, that the word of  opprobrium was no more than the truth, however offensive it might be  to his sensitiveness.
 He waited a moment until he could hold his voice  even.
 Then his words were the sternest protest that could have been  uttered, though they came from no exercise of thought, only out of the  deeps of his heart.
    "I'm very fond of her.
"    That was all.
 But the simple sincerity of the saying griped the father's  mood, as no argument could have done.
 There was a little silence.
 After  all, what could meet such loving loyalty?    When at last he spoke, Gilder's voice was subdued, a little husky.
    "Now, that you know?" he questioned.
    There was no faltering in the answer.
    "Now, that I know," Dick said distinctly.
 Then abruptly, the young man  spoke with the energy of perfect faith in the woman.
 "Don't you see,  father? Why, she is justified in a way, in her own mind anyhow, I mean.
  She was innocent when she was sent to prison.
 She feels that the world  owes her----"    But the older man would not permit the assertion to go uncontradicted.
  That reference to the woman's innocence was an arraignment of himself,  for it had been he who sent her to the term of imprisonment.
    "Don't talk to me about her innocence!" he said, and his voice was  ominous.
 "I suppose next you will argue that, because she's been clever  enough to keep within the law, since she's got out of State Prison,  she's not a criminal.
 But let me tell you--crime is crime, whether the  law touches it in the particular case, or whether it doesn't.
"    Gilder faced his son sternly for a moment, and then presently spoke  again with deeper earnestness.
    "There's only one course open to you, my boy.
 You must give this girl  up.
"    The son met his father's gaze with a level look in which there was no  weakness.
    "I've told you, Dad----" he began.
    "You must, I tell you," the father insisted.
 Then he went on quickly,  with a tone of utmost positiveness.
 "If you don't, what are you going to  do the day your wife is thrown into a patrol wagon and carried to Police  Headquarters--for it's sure to happen? The cleverest of people make  mistakes, and some day she'll make one.
"    Dick threw out his hands in a gesture of supreme denial.
 He was furious  at this supposition that she would continue in her irregular practices.
    But the father went on remorselessly.
    "They will stand her up where the detectives will walk past her with  masks on their faces.
 Her picture, of course, is already in the Rogues'  Gallery, but they will take another.
 Yes, and the imprints of her  fingers, and the measurements of her body.
"    The son was writhing under the words.
 The woman of whom these things  were said was the woman whom he loved.
 It was blasphemy to think of  her in such case, subjected to the degradation of these processes.
 Yet,  every word had in it the piercing, horrible sting of truth.
 His face  whitened.
 He raised a supplicating hand.
    "Father!"    "That's what they will do to your wife," Gilder went on harshly; "to the  woman who bears your name and mine.
" There was a little pause, and the  father stood rigid, menacing.
 The final question came rasping.
 "What are  you going to do about it?"    Dick went forward until he was close to his father.
 Then he spoke with  profound conviction.
    "It will never happen.
 She will go straight, Dad.
 That I know.
 You would  know it if you only knew her as I do.
"    Gilder once again put his hand tenderly on his son's shoulder.
 His voice  was modulated to an unaccustomed mildness as he spoke.
    "Be sensible, boy," he pleaded softly.
 "Be sensible!"    Dick dropped down on the couch, and made his answer very gently, his  eyes unseeing as he dwelt on the things he knew of the woman he loved.
    "Why, Dad," he said, "she is young.
 She's just like a child in a hundred  ways.
 She loves the trees and the grass and the flowers--and everything  that's simple and real! And as for her heart--" His voice was low and  very tender: "Why, her heart is the biggest I've ever known.
 It's just  overflowing with sweetness and kindness.
 I've seen her pick up a baby  that had fallen in the street, and mother it in a way that--well, no one  could do it as she did it, unless her soul was clean.
"    The father was silent, a little awed.
 He made an effort to shake off the  feeling, and spoke with a sneer.
    "You heard what she said yesterday, and you still are such a fool as to  think that.
"    The answer of the son came with an immutable finality, the sublime faith  of love.
    "I don't think--I know!"    Gilder was in despair.
 What argument could avail him? He cried out  sharply in desperation.
    "Do you realize what you're doing? Don't go to smash, Dick, just at the  beginning of your life.
 Oh, I beg you, boy, stop! Put this girl out of  your thoughts and start fresh.
"    The reply was of the simplest, and it was the end of argument.
    "Father," Dick said, very gently, "I can't.
"    There followed a little period of quiet between the two.
 The father,  from his desk, stood facing his son, who thus denied him in all honesty  because the heart so commanded.
 The son rested motionless and looked  with unflinching eyes into his father's face.
 In the gaze of each was a  great affection.
    "You're all I have, my boy," the older man said at last.
 And now the big  voice was a mildest whisper of love.
    "Yes, Dad," came the answer--another whisper, since it is hard to voice  the truth of feeling such as this.
 "If I could avoid it, I wouldn't hurt  you for anything in the world.
 I'm sorry, Dad, awfully sorry----" He  hesitated, then his voice rang out clearly.
 There was in his tone, when  he spoke again, a recognition of that loneliness which is the curse and  the crown of being:    "But," he ended, "I must fight this out by myself--fight it out in my  own way.
.
.
.
 And I'm going to do it!"        .
 BURKE PLOTS.
    The butler entered.
    "A man to see you, sir," he said.
    Gilder made a gesture of irritation, as he sank into the chair at his  desk.
    "I can't see any one to-night, Thomas," he exclaimed, sharply.
    "But he said it was most important, sir," the servant went on.
 He held  out the tray insistently.
    The master took the card grudgingly.
 As his eyes caught the name, his  expression changed slightly.
    "Very well," he said, "show him up.
" His glance met the wondering gaze  of his son.
    "It's Burke," he explained.
    "What on earth can he want--at this time of night?" Dick exclaimed.
    The father smiled grimly.
    "You may as well get used to visits from the police.
" There was  something ghastly in the effort toward playfulness.
    A moment later, Inspector Burke entered the room.
    "Oh, you're here, too," he said, as his eyes fell on Dick.
 "That's good.
  I wanted to see you, too.
"    Inspector Burke was, in fact, much concerned over the situation that  had developed.
 He was a man of undoubted ability, and he took a keen  professional pride in his work.
 He possessed the faults of his class,  was not too scrupulous where he saw a safe opportunity to make a snug  sum of money through the employment of his official authority, was ready  to buckle to those whose influence could help or hinder his ambition.
  But, in spite of these ordinary defects, he was fond of his work and  wishful to excel in it.
 Thus, Mary Turner had come to be a thorn in his  side.
 She flouted his authority and sustained her incredible effrontery  by a restraining order from the court.
 The thing was outrageous to him,  and he set himself to match her cunning.
 The fact that she had involved  Dick Gilder within her toils made him the more anxious to overcome her  in the strife of resources between them.
 After much studying, he had  at last planned something that, while it would not directly touch  Mary herself, would at least serve to intimidate her, and as well make  further action easier against her.
 It was in pursuit of this scheme  that he now came to Gilder's house, and the presence of the young man  abruptly gave him another idea that might benefit him well.
 So, he  disregarded Gilder's greeting, and went on speaking to the son.
    "She's skipped!" he said, triumphantly.
    Dick made a step forward.
 His eyes flashed, and there was anger in his  voice as he replied:    "I don't believe it.
"    The Inspector smiled, unperturbed.
    "She left this morning for Chicago," he said, lying with a manner that  long habit rendered altogether convincing.
 "I told you she'd go.
" He  turned to the father, and spoke with an air of boastful good nature.
  "Now, all you have to do is to get this boy out of the scrape and you'll  be all right.
"    "If we only could!" The cry came with deepest earnestness from the lips  of Gilder, but there was little hope in his voice.
    The Inspector, however, was confident of success, and his tones rang  cheerfully as he answered:    "I guess we can find a way to have the marriage annulled, or whatever  they do to marriages that don't take.
"    The brutal assurance of the man in thus referring to things that were  sacred, moved Dick to wrath.
    "Don't you interfere," he said.
 His words were spoken softly, but  tensely.
    Nevertheless, Burke held to the topic, but an indefinable change in his  manner rendered it less offensive to the young man.
    "Interfere! Huh!" he ejaculated, grinning broadly.
 "Why, that's what  I'm paid to do.
 Listen to me, son.
 The minute you begin mixing up with  crooks, you ain't in a position to give orders to any one.
 The crooks  have got no rights in the eyes of the police.
 Just remember that.
"    The Inspector spoke the simple truth as he knew it from years of  experience.
 The theory of the law is that a presumption of innocence  exists until the accused is proven guilty.
 But the police are out of  sympathy with such finical methods.
 With them, the crook is presumed  guilty at the outset of whatever may be charged against him.
 If need  be, there will be proof a-plenty against him--of the sort that the  underworld knows to its sorrow.
    But Dick was not listening.
 His thoughts were again wholly with the  woman he loved, who, as the Inspector declared, had fled from him.
    "Where's she gone in Chicago?"    Burke answered in his usual gruff fashion, but with a note of kindliness  that was not without its effect on Dick.
    "I'm no mind-reader," he said.
 "But she's a swell little girl, all  right.
 I've got to hand it to her for that.
 So, she'll probably stop at  the Blackstone--that is, until the Chicago police are tipped off that  she is in town.
"    Of a sudden, the face of the young man took on a totally different  expression.
 Where before had been anger, now was a vivid eagerness.
 He  went close to the Inspector, and spoke with intense seriousness.
    "Burke," he said, pleadingly, "give me a chance.
 I'll leave for Chicago  in the morning.
 Give me twenty-four hours start before you begin  hounding her.
"    The Inspector regarded the speaker searchingly.
 His heavy face was  drawn in an expression of apparent doubt.
 Abruptly, then, he smiled  acquiescence.
    "Seems reasonable," he admitted.
    But the father strode to his son.
    "No, no, Dick," he cried.
 "You shall not go! You shall not go!"    Burke, however, shook his head in remonstrance against Gilder's plea.
  His huge voice came booming, weightily impressive.
    "Why not?" he questioned.
 "It's a fair gamble.
 And, besides, I like the  boy's nerve.
"    Dick seized on the admission eagerly.
    "And you'll agree?" he cried.
    "Yes, I'll agree," the Inspector answered.
    "Thank you," Dick said quietly.
    But the father was not content.
 On the contrary, he went toward the two  hurriedly, with a gesture of reproval.
    "You shall not go, Dick," he declared, imperiously.
    The Inspector shot a word of warning to Gilder in an aside that Dick  could not hear.
    "Keep still," he replied.
 "It's all right.
"    Dick went on speaking with a seriousness suited to the magnitude of his  interests.
    "You give me your word, Inspector," he said, "that you won't notify the  police in Chicago until I've been there twenty-four hours?"    "You're on," Burke replied genially.
 "They won't get a whisper out of me  until the time is up.
" He swung about to face the father, and there  was a complete change in his manner.
 "Now, then, Mr. Gilder," he said  briskly, "I want to talk to you about another little matter----"    Dick caught the suggestion, and interrupted quickly.
    "Then I'll go.
" He smiled rather wanly at his father.
 "You know, Dad,  I'm sorry, but I've got to do what I think is the right thing.
"    Burke helped to save the situation from the growing tenseness.
    "Sure," he cried heartily; "sure you have.
 That's the best any of us can  do.
" He watched keenly as the young man went out of the room.
 It was not  until the door was closed after Dick that he spoke.
 Then he dropped to a  seat on the couch, and proceeded to make his confidences to the magnate.
    "He'll go to Chicago in the morning, you think, don't you?"    "Certainly," Gilder answered.
 "But I don't like it.
"    Burke slapped his leg with an enthusiasm that might have broken a weaker  member.
    "Best thing that could have happened!" he vociferated.
 And then, as  Gilder regarded him in astonishment, he added, chuckling: "You see, he  won't find her there.
"    "Why do you think that?" Gilder demanded, greatly puzzled.
    Burke permitted himself the luxury of laughing appreciatively a moment  more before making his exclamation.
 Then he said quietly:    "Because she didn't go there.
"    "Where did she go, then?" Gilder queried wholly at a loss.
    Once again the officer chuckled.
 It was evident that he was well pleased  with his own ingenuity.
    "Nowhere yet," he said at last.
 "But, just about the time he's starting  for the West I'll have her down at Headquarters.
 Demarest will have  her indicted before noon.
 She'll go for trial in the afternoon.
 And  to-morrow night she'll be sleeping up the river.
.
.
.
 That's where she is  going.
"    Gilder stood motionless for a moment.
 After all, he was an ordinary  citizen, quite unfamiliar with the recondite methods familiar to the  police.
    "But," he said, wonderingly, "you can't do that.
"    The Inspector laughed, a laugh of disingenuous amusement, for he  understood perfectly the lack of comprehension on the part of his  hearer.
    "Well," he said, and his voice sank into a modest rumble that was  none the less still thunderous.
 "Perhaps I can't!" And then he beamed  broadly, his whole face smiling blandly on the man who doubted his  power.
 "Perhaps I can't," he repeated.
 Then the chuckle came again, and  he added emphatically: "But I will!" Suddenly, his heavy face grew hard.
  His alert eyes shone fiercely, with a flash of fire that was known  to every patrolman who had ever reported to the desk when he was  lieutenant.
 His heavy jaw shot forward aggressively as he spoke.
    "Think I'm going to let that girl make a joke of the Police Department?  Why, I'm here to get her--to stop her anyhow.
 Her gang is going to break  into your house to-night.
"    "What?" Gilder demanded.
 "You mean, she's coming here as a thief?"    "Not exactly," Inspector Burke confessed, "but her pals are coming to  try to pull off something right here.
 She wouldn't come, not if I  know her.
 She's too clever for that.
 Why, if she knew what Garson was  planning to do, she'd stop him.
"    The Inspector paused suddenly.
 For a long minute his face was seamed  with thought.
 Then, he smote his thigh with a blow strong enough to kill  an ox.
 His face was radiant.
    "By God! I've got her!" he cried.
 The inspiration for which he had  longed was his at last.
 He went to the desk where the telephone was, and  took up the receiver.
    "Give me 3100 Spring," he said.
 As he waited for the connection he  smiled widely on the astonished Gilder.
 "'Tain't too late," he said  joyously.
 "I must have been losing my mind not to have thought of it  before.
" The impact of sounds on his ear from the receiver set him to  attention.
    "Headquarters?" he called.
 "Inspector Burke speaking.
 Who's in my  office? I want him quick.
" He smiled as he listened, and he spoke again  to Gilder.
 "It's Smith, the best man I have.
 That's luck, if you ask  me.
" Then again he spoke into the mouthpiece of the telephone.
    "Oh, Ed, send some one up to that Turner woman.
 You have the address.
  Just see that she is tipped off, that Joe Garson and some pals are going  to break into Edward Gilder's house to-night.
 Get some stool-pigeon  to hand her the information.
 You'd better get to work damned quick.
  Understand?"    The Inspector pulled out that watch of which Aggie Lynch had spoken so  avariciously, and glanced at it, then went on speaking:    "It's ten-thirty now.
 She went to the Lyric Theater with some woman.
 Get  her as she leaves, or find her back at her own place later.
 You'll have  to hustle, anyhow.
 That's all!"    The Inspector hung up the receiver and faced his host with a contented  smile.
    "What good will all that do?" Gilder demanded, impatiently.
    Burke explained with a satisfaction natural to one who had devised  something ingenious and adequate.
 This inspiration filled him with  delight.
 At last he was sure of catching Mary Turner herself in his  toils.
    "She'll come to stop 'em," he said.
 "When we get the rest of the gang,  we'll grab her, too.
 Why, I almost forgot her, thinking about Garson.
  Mr. Gilder, you would hardly believe it, but there's scarcely been a  real bit of forgery worth while done in this country for the last twenty  years, that Garson hasn't been mixed up in.
 We've never once got him  right in all that time.
" The Inspector paused to chuckle.
 "Crooks are  funny," he explained with obvious contentment.
 "Clever as he is, Garson  let Griggs talk him into a second-story job, and now we'll get him with  the goods.
.
.
.
 Just call your man for a minute, will you, Mr. Gilder?"    Gilder pressed the electric button on his desk.
 At the same moment,  through the octagonal window came a blinding flash of light that  rested for seconds, then vanished.
 Burke, by no means a nervous man,  nevertheless was startled by the mysterious radiance.
    "What's that?" he demanded, sharply.
    "It's the flashlight from the Metropolitan Tower," Gilder explained with  a smile over the policeman's perturbation.
 "It swings around this way  about every fifteen minutes.
 The servant forgot to draw the curtains.
"  As he spoke, he went to the window, and pulled the heavy draperies  close.
 "It won't bother us again.
"    The entrance of the butler brought the Inspector's thoughts back to the  matter in hand.
    "My man," he said, authoritatively, "I want you to go up to the roof and  open the scuttle.
 You'll find some men waiting up there.
 Bring 'em down  here.
"    The servant's usually impassive face showed astonishment, not unmixed  with dismay, and he looked doubtfully toward his master, who nodded  reassuringly.
    "Oh, they won't hurt you," the Inspector declared, as he noticed the  man's hesitation.
 "They're police officers.
 You get 'em down here, and  then you go to bed and stay there till morning.
 Understand?"    Again, the butler looked at his master for guidance in this very  peculiar affair, as he deemed it.
 Receiving another nod, he said:    "Very well, sir.
" He regarded the Inspector with a certain helpless  indignation over this disturbance of the natural order, and left the  room.
    Gilder himself was puzzled over the situation, which was by no means  clear to him.
    "How do you know they're going to break into the house to-night?" he  demanded of Burke; "or do you only think they're going to break into the  house?"    "I know they are.
" The Inspector's harsh voice brought out the words  boastfully.
 "I fixed it.
"    "You did!" There was wonder in the magnate's exclamation.
    "Sure," Burke declared complacently, "did it through a stool-pigeon.
"    "Oh, an informer," Gilder interrupted, a little doubtfully.
    "Yes," Burke agreed.
 "Stool-pigeon is the police name for him.
 Really,  he's the vilest thing that crawls.
"    "But, if you think that," Gilder expostulated, "why do you have anything  to do with that sort of person?"    "Because it's good business," the Inspector replied.
 "We know he's a spy  and a traitor, and that every time he comes near us we ought to use a  disinfectant.
 But we deal with him just the same--because we have to.
  Now, the stool-pigeon in this trick is a swell English crook.
 He went  to Garson yesterday with a scheme to rob your house.
 He tried out Mary  Turner, too, but she wouldn't stand for it--said it would break the law,  which is contrary to her principles.
 She told Garson to leave it alone.
  But he met Griggs afterward without her knowing anything about it, and  then he agreed to pull it off.
 Griggs got word to me that it's coming  off to-night.
 And so, you see, Mr. Gilder, that's how I know.
 Do you get  me?"    "I see," Gilder admitted without any enthusiasm.
 As a matter of fact, he  felt somewhat offended that his house should be thus summarily seized as  a trap for criminals.
    "But why do you have your men come down over the roof?" he inquired  curiously.
    "It wasn't safe to bring them in the front way," was the Inspector's  prompt reply.
 "It's a cinch the house is being watched.
 I wish you would  let me have your latch-key.
 I want to come back, and make this collar  myself.
"    The owner of the house obediently took the desired key from his ring and  gave it to the Inspector with a shrug of resignation.
    "But, why not stay, now that you are here?" he asked.
    "Huh!" Burke retorted.
 "Suppose some of them saw me come in? There  wouldn't be anything doing until after they see me go out again.
"    The hall door opened and the butler reentered the room.
 Behind him came  Cassidy and two other detectives in plain clothes.
 At a word from his  master, the disturbed Thomas withdrew with the intention of obeying  the Inspector's directions that he should retire to bed and stay there,  carefully avoiding whatever possibilities of peril there might be in the  situation so foreign to his ideals of propriety.
    "Now," Burke went on briskly, as the door closed behind the servant,  "where could these men stay out of sight until they're needed?"    There followed a little discussion which ended in the selection of a  store-room at the end of the passage on the ground floor, on which one  of the library doors opened.
    "You see," Burke explained to Gilder, when this matter had been settled  to his satisfaction, and while Cassidy and the other detectives were  out of the library on a tour of inspection, "you must have things right,  when it comes to catching crooks on a frame-up like this.
 I had these  men come to Number Twenty-six on the other street, then round the block  on the roofs.
"    Gilder nodded appreciation which was not actually sincere.
 It seemed to  him that such elaborate manoeuvering was, in truth, rather absurd.
    "And now, Mr. Gilder," the Inspector said energetically, "I'm going to  give you the same tip I gave your man.
 Go to bed, and stay there.
"    "But the boy," Gilder protested.
 "What about him? He's the one thing of  importance to me.
"    "If he says anything more about going to Chicago--just you let him go,  that's all! It's the best place for him for the next few days.
 I'll get  in touch with you in the morning and let you know then how things are  coming out.
"    Gilder sighed resignedly.
 His heavy face was lined with anxiety.
 There  was a hesitation in his manner of speech that was wholly unlike its  usual quick decisiveness.
    "I don't like this sort of thing," he said, doubtfully.
 "I let you go  ahead because I can't suggest any alternative, but I don't like it,  not at all.
 It seems to me that other methods might be employed with  excellent results without the element of treachery which seems to  involve me as well as you in our efforts to overcome this woman.
"    Burke, however, had no qualms as to such plotting.
    "You must have crooked ways to catch crooks, believe me," he said  cheerfully.
 "It's the easiest and quickest way out of the trouble for  us, and the easiest and quickest way into trouble for them.
"    The return of the detectives caused him to break off, and he gave his  attention to the final arrangements of his men.
    "You're in charge here," he said to Cassidy, "and I hold you  responsible.
 Now, listen to this, and get it.
" His coarse voice came  with a grating note of command.
 "I'm coming back to get this bunch  myself, and I'll call you when you're wanted.
 You'll wait in the  store-room out there and don't make a move till you hear from me, unless  by any chance things go wrong and you get a call from Griggs.
 You know  who he is.
 He's got a whistle, and he'll use it if necessary.
.
.
.
 Got  that straight?" And, when Cassidy had declared an entire understanding  of the directions given, he concluded concisely.
 "On your way, then!"    As the men left the room, he turned again to Gilder.
    "Just one thing more," he said.
 "I'll have to have your help a little  longer.
 After I've gone, I want you to stay up for a half-hour anyhow,  with the lights burning.
 Do you see? I want to be sure to give the  Turner woman time to get here while that gang is at work.
 Your keeping  on the lights will hold them back, for they won't come in till the house  is dark, so, in half an hour you can get off the job, switch off the  lights and go to bed and stay there--just as I told you before.
" Then  Inspector Burke, having in mind the great distress of the man over the  unfortunate entanglement of his son, was at pains to offer a reassuring  word.
    "Don't worry about the boy," he said, with grave kindliness.
 "We'll get  him out of this scrape all right.
" And with the assertion he bustled  out, leaving the unhappy father to miserable forebodings.
        .
 OUTSIDE THE LAW.
    Gilder scrupulously followed the directions of the Police Inspector.
  Uneasily, he had remained in the library until the allotted time was  elapsed.
 He fidgeted from place to place, his mind heavy with distress  under the shadow that threatened to blight the life of his cherished  son.
 Finally, with a sense of relief he put out the lights and went to  his chamber.
 But he did not follow the further directions given him, for  he was not minded to go to bed.
 Instead, he drew the curtains closely  to make sure that no gleam of light could pass them, and then sat with a  cigar between his lips, which he did not smoke, though from time to time  he was at pains to light it.
 His thoughts were most with his son, and  ever as he thought of Dick, his fury waxed against the woman who had  enmeshed the boy in her plotting for vengeance on himself.
 And into his  thoughts now crept a doubt, one that alarmed his sense of justice.
 It  occurred to him that this woman could not have thus nourished a plan for  retribution through the years unless, indeed, she had been insane, even  as he had claimed--or innocent! The idea was appalling.
 He could not  bear to admit the possibility of having been the involuntary inflicter  of such wrong as to send the girl to prison for an offense she had not  committed.
 He rejected the suggestion, but it persisted.
 He knew the  clean, wholesome nature of his son.
 It seemed to him incredible that  the boy could have thus given his heart to one altogether undeserving.
  A horrible suspicion that he had misjudged Mary Turner crept into his  brain, and would not out.
 He fought it with all the strength of him,  and that was much, but ever it abode there.
 He turned for comfort to the  things Burke had said.
 The woman was a crook, and there was an end  of it.
 Her ruse of spoliation within the law was evidence of her  shrewdness, nothing more.
    Mary Turner herself, too, was in a condition utterly wretched, and for  the same cause--Dick Gilder.
 That source of the father's suffering was  hers as well.
 She had won her ambition of years, revenge on the man who  had sent her to prison.
 And now the joy of it was a torture, for the  puppet of her plans, the son, had suddenly become the chief thing in her  life.
 She had taken it for granted that he would leave her after he came  to know that her marriage to him was only a device to bring shame on  his father.
 Instead, he loved her.
 That fact seemed the secret of her  distress.
 He loved her.
 More, he dared believe, and to assert boldly,  that she loved him.
 Had he acted otherwise, the matter would have been  simple enough.
.
.
.
 But he loved her, loved her still, though he knew the  shame that had clouded her life, knew the motive that had led her to  accept him as a husband.
 More--by a sublime audacity, he declared that  she loved him.
    There came a thrill in her heart each time she thought of that--that  she loved him.
 The idea was monstrous, of course, and yet---- Here,  as always, she broke off, a hot flush blazing in her cheeks.
.
.
.
  Nevertheless, such curious fancies pursued her through the hours.
 She  strove her mightiest to rid herself of them, but in vain.
 Ever they  persisted.
 She sought to oust them by thinking of any one else, of  Aggie, of Joe.
 There at last was satisfaction.
 Her interference between  the man who had saved her life and the temptation of the English crook  had prevented a dangerous venture, which might have meant ruin to the  one whom she esteemed for his devotion to her, if for no other reason.
  At least, she had kept him from the outrageous folly of an ordinary  burglary.
    Mary Turner was just ready for bed after her evening at the theater,  when she was rudely startled out of this belief.
 A note came by a  messenger who waited for no answer, as he told the yawning maid.
 As Mary  read the roughly scrawled message, she was caught in the grip of terror.
  Some instinct warned her that this danger was even worse than it seemed.
  The man who had saved her from death had yielded to temptation.
 Even  now, he was engaged in committing that crime which she had forbidden  him.
 As he had saved her, so she must save him.
 She hurried into the  gown she had just put off.
 Then she went to the telephone-book and  searched for the number of Gilder's house.
             It was just a few moments before Mary Turner received the note from the  hands of the sleepy maid that one of the leaves of the octagonal window  in the library of Richard Gilder's town house swung open, under the  persuasive influence of a thin rod of steel, cunningly used, and Joe  Garson stepped confidently into the dark room.
    A faint radiance of moonlight from without showed him for a second as he  passed between the heavy draperies.
 Then these fell into place, and he  was invisible, and soundless as well.
 For a space, he rested motionless,  listening intently.
 Reassured, he drew out an electric torch and set it  glowing.
 A little disc of light touched here and there about the room,  traveling very swiftly, and in methodical circles.
 Satisfied by the  survey, Garson crossed to the hall door.
 He moved with alert assurance,  lithely balanced on the balls of his feet, noiselessly.
 At the hall door  he listened for any sound of life without, and found none.
 The door into  the passage that led to the store-room where the detectives waited next  engaged his business-like attention.
 And here, again, there was naught  to provoke his suspicion.
    These preliminaries taken as measures of precaution, Garson went boldly  to the small table that stood behind the couch, turned the button,  and the soft glow of an electric lamp illumined the apartment.
 The  extinguished torch was thrust back into his pocket.
 Afterward he carried  one of the heavy chairs to the door of the passage and propped it  against the panel in such wise that its fall must give warning as to the  opening of the door.
 His every action was performed with the maximum of  speed, with no least trace of flurry or of nervous haste.
 It was evident  that he followed a definite program, the fruit of precise thought guided  by experience.
    It seemed to him that now everything was in readiness for the coming of  his associates in the commission of the crime.
 There remained only to  give them the signal in the room around the corner where they waited at  a telephone.
 He seated himself in Gilder's chair at the desk, and drew  the telephone to him.
    "Give me 999 Bryant," he said.
 His tone was hardly louder than a  whisper, but spoken with great distinctness.
    There was a little wait.
 Then an answer in a voice he knew came over the  wire.
    But Garson said nothing more.
 Instead, he picked up a penholder from  the tray on the desk, and began tapping lightly on the rim of the  transmitter.
 It was a code message in Morse.
 In the room around the  corner, the tapping sounded clearly, ticking out the message that the  way was free for the thieves' coming.
    When Garson had made an end of the telegraphing, there came a brief  answer in like Morse, to which he returned a short direction.
    For a final safeguard, Garson searched for and found the telephone  bell-box on the surbase below the octagonal window.
 It was the work of  only a few seconds to unscrew the bells, which he placed on the desk.
  So simply he made provision against any alarm from this source.
 He then  took his pistol from his hip-pocket, examined it to make sure that  the silencer was properly adjusted, and then thrust it into the right  side-pocket of his coat, ready for instant use in desperate emergency.
  Once again, now, he produced the electric torch, and lighted it as he  extinguished the lamp on the table.
    Forthwith, Garson went to the door into the hall, opened it, and,  leaving it ajar, made his way in silence to the outer doorway.
  Presently, the doors there were freed of their bolts under his skilled  fingers, and one of them swung wide.
 He had put out the torch now, lest  its gleam might catch the gaze of some casual passer-by.
 So nicely had  the affair been timed that hardly was the door open before the three  men slipped in, and stood mute and motionless in the hall, while Garson  refastened the doors.
 Then, a pencil of light traced the length of the  hallway and Garson walked quickly back to the library.
 Behind him with  steps as noiseless as his own came the three men to whom he had just  given the message.
    When all were gathered in the library, Garson shut the hall door,  touched the button in the wall beside it, and the chandelier threw its  radiant light on the group.
    Griggs was in evening clothes, seeming a very elegant young gentleman  indeed, but his two companions were of grosser type, as far as  appearances went: one, Dacey, thin and wiry, with a ferret face; the  other, Chicago Red, a brawny ruffian, whose stolid features nevertheless  exhibited something of half-sullen good nature.
    "Everything all right so far," Garson said rapidly.
 He turned to Griggs  and pointed toward the heavy hangings that shrouded the octagonal  window.
 "Are those the things we want?" he demanded.
    "Yes," was the answer of English Eddie.
    "Well, then, we've got to get busy," Garson went on.
 His alert,  strong face was set in lines of eagerness that had in it something of  fierceness now.
    But, before he could add a direction, he was halted by a soft buzzing  from the telephone, which, though bell-less, still gave this faint  warning of a call.
 For an instant, he hesitated while the others  regarded him doubtfully.
 The situation offered perplexities.
 To give no  attention to the summons might be perilous, and failure to respond might  provoke investigation in some urgent matter; to answer it might easily  provide a larger danger.
    "We've got to take a chance.
" Garson spoke his decision curtly.
 He went  to the desk and put the receiver to his ear.
    There came again the faint tapping of some one at the other end of the  line, signaling a message in the Morse code.
 An expression of blank  amazement, which grew in a flash to deep concern, showed on Garson's  face as he listened tensely.
    "Why, this is Mary calling," he muttered.
    "Mary!" Griggs cried.
 His usual vacuity of expression was cast off like  a mask and alarm twisted his features.
 Then, in the next instant, a  crafty triumph gleamed from his eyes.
    "Yes, she's on," Garson interpreted, a moment later, as the tapping  ceased for a little.
 He translated in a loud whisper as the irregular  ticking noise sounded again.
    "I shall be there at the house almost at once.
 I am sending this message  from the drug store around the corner.
 Have some one open the door for  me immediately.
"    "She's coming over," Griggs cried incredulously.
    "No, I'll stop her," Garson declared firmly.
    "Right! Stop her," Chicago Red vouchsafed.
    But, when, after tapping a few words, the forger paused for the reply,  no sound came.
    "She don't answer," he exclaimed, greatly disconcerted.
 He tried again,  still without result.
 At that, he hung up the receiver with a groan.
  "She's gone----"    "On her way already," Griggs suggested, and there was none to doubt that  it was so.
    "What's she coming here for?" Garson exclaimed harshly.
 "This ain't no  place for her! Why, if anything should go wrong now----"    But Griggs interrupted him with his usual breezy cheerfulness of manner.
    "Oh, nothing can go wrong now, old top.
 I'll let her in.
" He drew a  small torch from the skirt-pocket of his coat and crossed to the hall  door, as Garson nodded assent.
    "God! Why did she have to come?" Garson muttered, filled with  forebodings.
 "If anything should go wrong now!"    He turned back toward the door just as it opened, and Mary darted into  the room with Griggs following.
 "What do you want here?" he demanded,  with peremptory savageness in his voice, which was a tone he had never  hitherto used in addressing her.
    Mary went swiftly to face Garson where he stood by the desk, while  Griggs joined the other two men who stood shuffling about uneasily by  the fireplace, at a loss over this intrusion on their scheme.
 Mary moved  with a lissome grace like that of some wild creature, but as she halted  opposite the man who had given her back the life she would have thrown  away, there was only tender pleading in her voice, though her words were  an arraignment.
    "Joe, you lied to me.
"    "That can be settled later," the man snapped.
 His jaw was thrust forward  obstinately, and his clear eyes sparkled defiantly.
    "You are fools, all of you!" Mary cried.
 Her eyes darkened and distended  with fear.
 They darted from Garson to the other three men, and back  again in rebuke.
 "Yes, fools! This is burglary.
 I can't protect you if  you are caught.
 How can I? Oh, come!" She held out her hands pleadingly  toward Garson, and her voice dropped to beseeching.
 "Joe, Joe, you must  get away from this house at once, all of you.
 Joe, make them go.
"    "It's too late," was the stern answer.
 There was no least relaxation in  the stubborn lines of his face.
 "We're here now, and we'll stay till the  business is done.
"    Mary went a step forward.
 The cloak she was wearing was thrown back by  her gesture of appeal so that those watching saw the snowy slope of the  shoulders and the quick rise and fall of the gently curving bosom.
 The  beautiful face within the framing scarf was colorless with a great fear,  save only the crimson lips, of which the bow was bent tremulously as she  spoke her prayer.
    "Joe, for my sake!"    But the man was inexorable.
 He had set himself to this thing, and even  the urging of the one person in the world for whom he most cared was  powerless against his resolve.
    "I can't quit now until we've got what we came here after," he declared  roughly.
    Of a sudden, the girl made shift to employ another sort of supplication.
    "But there are reasons," she said, faltering.
 A certain embarrassment  swept her, and the ivory of her cheeks bloomed rosily.
 "I--I can't have  you rob this house, this particular house of all the world.
" Her eyes  leaped from the still obdurate face of the forger to the group of three  back of him.
 Her voice was shaken with a great dread as she called out  to them.
    "Boys, let's get away! Please, oh, please! Joe, for God's sake!" Her  tone was a sob.
    Her anguish of fear did not swerve Garson from his purpose.
    "I'm going to see this through," he said, doggedly.
    "But, Joe----"    "It's settled, I tell you.
"    In the man's emphasis the girl realized at last the inefficacy of her  efforts to combat his will.
 She seemed to droop visibly before their  eyes.
 Her head sank on her breast.
 Her voice was husky as she tried to  speak.
    "Then----" She broke off with a gesture of despair, and turned away  toward the door by which she had entered.
    But, with a movement of great swiftness, Garson got in front of her,  and barred her going.
 For a few seconds the two stared at each other  searchingly as if learning new and strange things, each of the other.
 In  the girl's expression was an outraged wonder and a great terror.
 In the  man's was a half-shamed pride, as if he exulted in the strength with  which he had been able to maintain his will against her supreme effort  to overthrow it.
    "You can't go," Garson said sharply.
 "You might be caught.
"    "And if I were," Mary demanded in a flash of indignation, "do you think  I'd tell?"    There came an abrupt change in the hard face of the man.
 Into the  piercing eyes flamed a softer fire of tenderness.
 The firm mouth grew  strangely gentle as he replied, and his voice was overtoned with faith.
    "Of course not, Mary," he said.
 "I know you.
 You would go up for life  first.
"    Then again his expression became resolute, and he spoke imperiously.
    "Just the same, you can't take any chances.
 We'll all get away in a  minute, and you'll come with us.
" He turned to the men and spoke with  swift authority.
    "Come," he said to Dacey, "you get to the light switch there by the hall  door.
 If you hear me snap my fingers, turn 'em off.
 Understand?"    With instant obedience, the man addressed went to his station by the  hall door, and stood ready to control the electric current.
    The distracted girl essayed one last plea.
 The momentary softening of  Garson had given her new courage.
    "Joe, don't do this.
"    "You can't stop it now, Mary," came the brisk retort.
 "Too late.
 You're  only wasting time, making it dangerous for all of us.
"    Again he gave his attention to carrying on the robbery.
    "Red," he ordered, "you get to that door.
" He pointed to the one that  gave on the passageway against which he had set the chair tilted.
 As the  man obeyed, Garson gave further instructions.
    "If any one comes in that way, get him and get him quick.
 You  understand? Don't let him cry out.
"    Chicago Red grinned with cheerful acceptance of the issue in such an  encounter.
 He held up his huge hand, widely open.
    "Not a chance," he declared, proudly, "with that over his mug.
" To avoid  possible interruption of his movements in an emergency, he removed the  chair Garson had placed and set it to one side, out of the way.
    "Now, let's get to work," Garson continued eagerly.
 Mary spoke with the  bitterness of defeat.
    "Listen, Joe! If you do this, I'm through with you.
 I quit.
"    Garson was undismayed by the threat.
    "If this goes through," he countered, "we'll all quit.
 That's why I'm  doing it.
 I'm sick of the game.
"    He turned to the work in hand with increased energy.
    "Come, you, Griggs and Red, and push that desk down a bit so that I can  stand on it.
" The two men bent to the task, heedless of Mary's frantic  protest.
    "No! no! no! no! no, Joe!"    Red, however, suddenly straightened from the desk and stood motionless,  listening.
 He made a slight hissing noise that arrested the attention of  the others and held them in moveless silence.
    "I hear something," he whispered.
 He went to the keyhole of the door  leading into the passage.
 Then he whispered again, "And it's coming this  way.
"    At the words, Garson snapped his fingers.
 The room was plunged in  darkness.
        .
 THE NOISELESS DEATH.
    There was absolute silence in the library after the turning of the  switch that brought the pall of darkness.
 Long seconds passed, then a  little noise--the knob of the passage door turning.
 As the door swung  open, there came a gasping breath from Mary, for she saw framed in the  faint light that came from the single burner in the corridor the slender  form of her husband, Dick Gilder.
 In the next instant he had stepped  within the room and pulled to the door behind him.
 And in that same  instant Chicago Red had pounced on his victim, the huge hand clapped  tight over the young man's mouth.
 Even as his powerful arm held the  newcomer in an inescapable embrace, there came a sound of scuffling feet  and that was all.
 Finally the big man's voice came triumphantly.
    "I've got him.
"    "It's Dick!" The cry came as a wail of despair from the girl.
    At the same moment, Garson flashed his torch, and the light fell  swiftly on young Gilder, bowed to a kneeling posture before the couch,  half-throttled by the strength of Chicago Red.
 Close beside him, Mary  looked down in wordless despair over this final disaster of the night.
  There was silence among the men, all of whom save the captor himself  were gathered near the fireplace.
    Garson retired a step farther before he spoke his command, so that,  though he held the torch still, he like the others was in shadow.
 Only  Mary was revealed clearly as she bent in alarm toward the man she had  married.
 It was borne in on the forger's consciousness that the face of  the woman leaning over the intruder was stronger to hold the prisoner  and to prevent any outcry than the might of Chicago Red himself, and so  he gave the order.
    "Get away, Red.
"    The fellow let go his grip obediently enough, though with a trifle of  regret, since he gloried in his physical prowess.
    Thus freed of that strangling embrace, Dick stumbled blindly to his  feet.
 Then, mechanically, his hand went to the lamp on the table back  of the couch.
 In the same moment Garson snapped his torch to darkness.
  When, after a little futile searching, Dick finally found the catch, and  the mellow streamed forth, he uttered an ejaculation of stark amazement,  for his gaze was riveted on the face of the woman he loved.
    "Good God!" It was a cry of torture wrung from his soul of souls.
    Mary swayed toward him a little, palpitant with fear--fear for herself,  for all of them, most of all for him.
    "Hush! hush!" she panted warningly.
 "Oh, Dick, you don't understand.
"    Dick's hand was at his throat.
 It was not easy for him to speak yet.
 He  had suffered severely in the process of being throttled, and, too, he  was in the clutch of a frightful emotion.
 To find her, his wife, in this  place, in such company--her, the woman whom he loved, whom, in spite  of everything, he had honored, the woman to whom he had given his name!  Mary here! And thus!    "I understand this," he said brokenly at last.
 "Whether you ever did it  before or not, this time you have broken the law.
" A sudden inspiration  on his own behalf came to him.
 For his love's sake, he must seize on  this opportunity given of fate to him for mastery.
 He went on with a new  vehemence of boldness that became him well.
    "You're in my hands now.
 So are these men as well.
 Unless you do as I  say, Mary, I'll jail every one of them.
"    Mary's usual quickness was not lacking even now, in this period of  extremity.
 Her retort was given without a particle of hesitation.
    "You can't," she objected with conviction.
 "I'm the only one you've  seen.
"    "That's soon remedied," Dick declared.
 He turned toward the hall door as  if with the intention of lighting the chandelier.
    But Mary caught his arm pleadingly.
    "Don't, Dick," she begged.
 "It's--it's not safe.
"    "I'm not afraid," was his indignant answer.
 He would have gone on, but  she clung the closer.
 He was reluctant to use over-much force against  the one whom he cherished so fondly.
    There came a diversion from the man who had made the capture, who was  mightily wondering over the course of events, which was wholly unlike  anything in the whole of his own rather extensive housebreaking  experience.
    "Who's this, anyhow?" Chicago Red demanded.
    There was a primitive petulance in his drawling tones.
    Dick answered with conciseness enough.
    "I'm her husband.
 Who are you?"    Mary called a soft admonition.
    "Don't speak, any of you," she directed.
 "You mustn't let him hear your  voices.
"    Dick was exasperated by this persistent identification of herself with  these criminals in his father's house.
    "You're fighting me like a coward," he said hotly.
 His voice was bitter.
  The eyes that had always been warm in their glances on her were chill  now.
 He turned a little way from her, as if in instinctive repugnance.
  "You are taking advantage of my love.
 You think that because of it I  can't make a move against these men.
 Now, listen to me, I----"    "I won't!" Mary cried.
 Her words were shrill with mingled emotions.
  "There's nothing to talk about," she went on wildly.
 "There never can be  between you and me.
"    The young man's voice came with a sonorous firmness that was new to  it.
 In these moments, the strength of him, nourished by suffering, was  putting forth its flower.
 His manner was masterful.
    "There can be and there will be," he contradicted.
 He raised his voice a  little, speaking into the shadows where was the group of silent men.
    "You men back there!" he cried.
 "If I give you my word to let every one  of you go free and pledge myself never to recognize one of you again,  will you make Mary here listen to me? That's all I ask.
 I want a few  minutes to state my case.
 Give me that.
 Whether I win or lose, you men  go free, and I'll forget everything that has happened here to-night.
"  There came a muffled guffaw of laughter from the big chest of Chicago  Red at this extraordinarily ingenuous proposal, while Dacey chuckled  more quietly.
    Dick made a gesture of impatience at this open derision.
    "Tell them I can be trusted," he bade Mary curtly.
    It was Garson who answered.
    "I know that you can be trusted," he said, "because I know you lo----"  He checked himself with a shiver, and out of the darkness his face  showed white.
    "You must listen," Dick went on, facing again toward the girl, who was  trembling before him, her eyes by turns searching his expression  or downcast in unfamiliar confusion, which she herself could hardly  understand.
    "Your safety depends on me," the young man warned.
 "Suppose I should  call for help?"    Garson stepped forward threateningly.
    "You would only call once," he said very gently, yet most grimly.
 His  hand went to the noiseless weapon in his coat-pocket.
    But the young man's answer revealed the fact that he, too, was  determined to the utmost, that he understood perfectly the situation.
    "Once would be quite enough," he said simply.
    Garson nodded in acceptance of the defeat.
 It may be, too, that in some  subtle fashion he admired this youth suddenly grown resolute, competent  to control a dangerous event.
 There was even the possibility that some  instinct of tenderness toward Mary herself made him desire that this  opportunity should be given for wiping out the effects of misfortune  which fate hitherto had brought into her life.
    "You win," Garson said, with a half-laugh.
 He turned to the other men  and spoke a command.
    "You get over by the hall door, Red.
 And keep your ears open every  second.
 Give us the office if you hear anything.
 If we're rushed, and  have to make a quick get-away, see that Mary has the first chance.
 Get  that, all of you?"    As Chicago Red took up his appointed station, Garson turned to Dick.
    "Make it quick, remember.
"    He touched the other two and moved back to the wall by the fireplace, as  far as possible from the husband and wife by the couch.
    Dick spoke at once, with a hesitancy that betrayed the depth of his  emotion.
    "Don't you care for me at all?" he asked wistfully.
    The girl's answer was uttered with nervous eagerness which revealed her  own stress of fear.
    "No, no, no!" she exclaimed, rebelliously.
    Now, however, the young man had regained some measure of reassurance.
    "I know you do, Mary," he asserted, confidently; "a little, anyway.
 Why,  Mary," he went on reproachfully, "can't you see that you're throwing  away everything that makes life worth while? Don't you see that?"    There was no word from the girl.
 Her breast was moving convulsively.
 She  held her face steadfastly averted from the face of her husband.
    "Why don't you answer me?" he insisted.
    Mary's reply came with all the coldness she could command.
    "That was not in the bargain," Mary said, indifferently.
    The man's voice grew tenderly winning, persuasive with the longing of a  lover, persuasive with the pity of the righteous for the sinner.
    "Mary, Mary!" he cried.
 "You've got to change.
 Don't be so hard.
 Give  the woman in you a chance.
"    The girl's form became rigid as she fought for self-control.
 The plea  touched to the bottom of her heart, but she could not, would not yield.
  Her words rushed forth with a bitterness that was the cover of her  distress.
    "I am what I am," she said sharply.
 "I can't change.
 Keep your promise,  now, and let's get out of this.
"    Her assertion was disregarded as to the inability to change.
    "You can change," Dick went on impetuously.
 "Mary, haven't you ever  wanted the things that other women have, shelter, and care, and the big  things of life, the things worth while? They're all ready for you, now,  Mary.
.
.
.
 And what about me?" Reproach leaped in his tone.
 "After all,  you've married me.
 Now it's up to you to give me my chance to make good.
  I've never amounted to much.
 I've never tried much.
 I shall, now, if you  will have it so, Mary; if you'll help me.
 I will come out all right, I  know that--so do you, Mary.
 Only, you must help me.
"    "I help you!" The exclamation came from the girl in a note of  incredulous astonishment.
    "Yes," Dick said, simply.
 "I need you, and you need me.
 Come away with  me.
"    "No, no!" was the broken refusal.
 There was a great grief clutching at  the soul of this woman who had brought vengeance to its full flower.
  She was gasping.
 "No, no! I married you, not because I loved you, but to  repay your father the wrong he had done me.
 I wouldn't let myself even  think of you, and then--I realized that I had spoiled your life.
"    "No, not spoiled it, Mary! Blessed it! We must prove that yet.
"    "Yes, spoiled it," the wife went on passionately.
 "If I had understood,  if I could have dreamed that I could ever care---- Oh, Dick, I would  never have married you for anything in the world.
"    "But now you do realize," the young man said quietly.
 "The thing is  done.
 If we made a mistake, it is for us to bring happiness out of that  error.
"    "Oh, can't you see?" came the stricken lament.
 "I'm a jail-bird!"    "But you love me--you do love me, I know!" The young man spoke with  joyous certainty, for some inflection of her voice had told the truth  to his heart.
 Nothing else mattered.
 "But now, to come back to this hole  we're in here.
 Don't you understand, at last, that you can't beat the  law? If you're caught here to-night, where would you get off--caught  here with a gang of burglars? Tell me, dear, why did you do it? Why  didn't you protect yourself? Why didn't you go to Chicago as you  planned?"    "What?" There was a new quality in Mary's voice.
 A sudden throb of shock  masked in the surface indifference of intonation.
    Dick repeated his question, unobservant of its first effect.
    "Why didn't you go to Chicago as you had planned?"    "Planned? With whom?" The interrogation came with an abrupt force that  cried of new suspicions.
    "Why, with Burke.
" The young man tried to be patient over her density in  this time of crisis.
    "Who told you that I had arranged any such thing?" Mary asked.
 Now the  tenseness in her manner got the husband's attention, and he replied with  a sudden gravity, apprehensive of he knew not what.
    "Burke himself did.
"    "When?" Mary was standing rigid now, and the rare color flamed in her  cheeks.
 Her eyes were blazing.
    "Less than an hour ago.
" He had caught the contagion of her mood and  vague alarm swept him.
    "Where?" came the next question, still with that vital insistence.
    "In this room.
"    "Burke was here?" Mary's voice was suddenly cold, very dangerous.
 "What  was he doing here?"    "Talking to my father.
"    The seemingly simple answer appeared the last straw to the girl's burden  of frenzied suspicion.
 Her voice cut fiercely into the quiet of the  room, imperious, savage.
    "Joe, turn on that light! I want to see the face of every man in this  room.
"    Something fatally significant in her voice set Garson a-leap to the  switch, and, in the same second, the blaze of the chandelier flamed  brilliantly over all.
 The others stood motionless, blinking in the  sudden radiance--all save Griggs, who moved stealthily in that same  moment, a little nearer the door into the passage, which was nearest to  him.
    But Mary's next words came wholly as a surprise, seemingly totally  irrelevant to this instant of crisis.
 Yet they rang a-throb with an  hysterical anxiety.
    "Dick," she cried, "what are those tapestries worth?" With the question,  she pointed toward the draperies that shrouded the great octagonal  window.
    The young man was plainly astonished, disconcerted as well by the  obtrusion of a sordid detail into the tragedy of the time.
    "Why in the world do you----?" he began, impatiently.
    Mary stamped her foot angrily in protest against the delay.
    "Tell me--quick!" she commanded.
 The authority in her voice and manner  was not to be gainsaid.
    Dick yielded sullenly.
    "Oh, two or three hundred dollars, I suppose," he answered.
 "Why?"    "Never mind that!" Mary exclaimed, violently.
 And now the girl's voice  came stinging like a whiplash.
 In Garson's face, too, was growing fury,  for in an instant of illumination he guessed something of the truth.
  Mary's next question confirmed his raging suspicion.
    "How long have you had them, Dick?"    By now, the young man himself sensed the fact that something  mysteriously baneful lay behind the frantic questioning on this  seemingly trivial theme.
    "Ever since I can remember," he replied, promptly.
    Mary's voice came then with an intonation that brought enlightenment  not only to Garson's shrewd perceptions, but also to the heavier  intelligences of Dacey and of Chicago Red.
    "And they're not famous masterpieces which your father bought recently,  from some dealer who smuggled them into this country?" So simple were  the words of her inquiry, but under them beat something evil, deadly.
    The young man laughed contemptuously.
    "I should say not!" he declared indignantly, for he resented the  implication against his father's honesty.
    "It's a trick! Burke's done it!" Mary's words came with accusing  vehemence.
    There was another single step made by Griggs toward the door into the  passage.
    Mary's eye caught the movement, and her lips soundlessly formed the  name:    "Griggs!"    The man strove to carry off the situation, though he knew well that he  stood in mortal peril.
 He came a little toward the girl who had accused  him of treachery.
 He was very dapper in his evening clothes, with his  rather handsome, well-groomed face set in lines of innocence.
    "He's lying to you!" he cried forcibly, with a scornful gesture toward  Dick Gilder.
 "I tell you, those tapestries are worth a million cold.
"    Mary's answer was virulent in its sudden burst of hate.
 For once, the  music of her voice was lost in a discordant cry of detestation.
    "You stool-pigeon! You did this for Burke!"    Griggs sought still to maintain his air of innocence, and he strove  well, since he knew that he fought for his life against those whom  he had outraged.
 As he spoke again, his tones were tremulous with  sincerity--perhaps that tremulousness was born chiefly of fear, yet to  the ear his words came stoutly enough for truth:    "I swear I didn't! I swear it!"    Mary regarded the protesting man with abhorrence.
 The perjured wretch  shrank before the loathing in her eyes.
    "You came to me yesterday," she said, with more of restraint in her  voice now, but still with inexorable rancor.
 "You came to me to explain  this plan.
 And you came from him--from Burke!"    "I swear I was on the level.
 I was tipped off to the story by a pal,"  Griggs declared, but at last the assurance was gone out of his voice.
 He  felt the hostility of those about him.
    Garson broke in ferociously.
    "It's a frame-up!" he said.
 His tones came in a deadened roar of wrath.
    On the instant, aware that further subterfuge could be of no avail,  Griggs swaggered defiance.
    "And what if it is true?" he drawled, with a resumption of his  aristocratic manner, while his eyes swept the group balefully.
 He  plucked the police whistle from his waistcoat-pocket, and raised it to  his lips.
    He moved too slowly.
 In the same moment of his action, Garson had pulled  the pistol from his pocket, had pressed the trigger.
 There came no spurt  of flame.
 There was no sound--save perhaps a faint clicking noise.
 But  the man with the whistle at his lips suddenly ceased movement, stood  absolutely still for the space of a breath.
 Then, he trembled horribly,  and in the next instant crashed to the floor, where he lay rigid, dead.
    "Damn you--I've got you!" Garson sneered through clenched teeth.
 His  eyes were like balls of fire.
 There was a frightful grin of triumph  twisting his mouth in this minute of punishment.
    In the first second of the tragedy, Dick had not understood.
 Indeed, he  was still dazed by the suddenness of it all.
 But the falling of Griggs  before the leveled weapon of the other man, there to lie in that ghastly  immobility, made him to understand.
 He leaped toward Garson--would have  wrenched the pistol from the other's grasp.
 In the struggle, it fell to  the floor.
    Before either could pick it up, there came an interruption.
 Even in the  stress of this scene, Chicago Red had never relaxed his professional  caution.
 A slight noise had caught his ear, he had stooped, listening.
  Now, he straightened, and called his warning.
    "Somebody's opening the front door!"    Garson forgot his weapon in this new alarm.
 He sprang to the octagonal  window, even as Dick took possession of the pistol.
    "The street's empty! We must jump for it!" His hate was forgotten now  in an emotion still deeper, and he turned to Mary.
 His face was all  gentleness again, where just before it had been evil incarnate, aflame  with the lust to destroy.
 "Come on, Mary," he cried.
    Already Chicago Red had snapped off the lights of the chandelier, had  sprung to the window, thrown open a panel of it, and had vanished into  the night, with Dacey at his heels.
 As Garson would have called out to  the girl again in mad anxiety for haste, he was interrupted by Dick:    "She couldn't make it, Garson," he declared coolly and resolutely.
 "You  go.
 It'll be all right, you know.
 I'll take care of her!"    "If she's caught----!" There was an indescribable menace in the forger's  half-uttered threat.
    "She won't be.
" The quality of sincerity in Dick's voice was more  convincing than any vow might have been.
    "If she is, I'll get you, that's all," Garson said gravely, as one  stating a simple fact that could not be disputed.
    Then he glanced down at the body of the man whom he had done to death.
    "And you can tell that to Burke!" he said viciously to the dead.
 "You  damned squealer!" There was a supremely malevolent content in his sneer.
        .
 WITHIN THE TOILS.
    The going of Garson left the room deathly still.
 Dick stared for a  moment at the space of window left uncovered by the draperies now, since  the man had hurried past them, without pausing to draw them after him.
  Then, presently, the young man turned again to Mary, and took her hand  in his.
 The shock of the event had somehow steadied him, since it had  drawn his thoughts from that other more engrossing mood of concern over  the crisis in his own life.
 After all, what mattered the death of this  crook? his fancy ran.
 The one thing of real worth in all the world  was the life that remained to be lived between him and her.
.
.
.
 Then,  violently, the selfishness of his mood was made plain to him.
 For the  hand he held was shaking like some slender-stalked lily in the clutch  of the sirocco.
 Even as he first perceived the fact, he saw the girl  stagger.
 His arm swept about her in a virile protecting embrace--just in  time, or she would have fallen.
    A whisper came from her quivering lips.
 Her face was close to his, else  he could not have caught the uncertain murmuring.
 That face now was  become ghastly pale.
 The violet eyes were widened and dull.
 The muscles  of her face twitched.
 She rested supinely against him, as if bereft of  any strength of body or of soul.
 Yet, in the intensity of her utterance,  the feeble whisper struck like a shriek of horror.
    "I--I--never saw any one killed before!"    The simple, grisly truth of the words--words that he might have spoken  as well--stirred the man to the deeps of his being.
 He shuddered, as  he turned his eyes to avoid seeing the thing that lay so very near,  mercifully merged within the shadows beyond the gentle radiance from the  single lamp.
 With a pang of infinite pity for the woman in his arms, he  apprehended in some degree the torture this event must have inflicted  on her.
 Frightful to him, it must in truth be vastly worse to her.
 There  was her womanly sensitiveness to enhance the innate hideousness of the  thing that had been done here before their eyes.
 There was, too, the  fact that the murderer himself had been the man to whom she owed her  life.
 Yes, for him, Dick realized with poignant sympathy, the happening  that night was terrible indeed: for her, as he guessed now at last,  the torture must be something easily to overwhelm all her strength.
 His  touch on her grew tender beyond the ordinary tenderness of love, made  gentler by a great underlying compassion for her misery.
    Dick drew Mary toward the couch, there let her sink down in a huddled  attitude of despair.
    "I never saw a man--killed before!" she said again.
 There was a note of  half-hysterical, almost childish complaint in her voice.
 She moved  her head a little, as if to look into the shadows where _it_ lay,  then checked herself violently, and looked up at her husband with the  pathetic simplicity of terror.
    "You know, Dick," she repeated dully, "I never saw a man killed before.
"    Before he could utter the soothing words that rose to his lips, Dick was  interrupted by a slight sound at the door.
 Instantly, he was all alert  to meet the exigencies of the situation.
 He stood by the couch, bending  forward a little, as if in a posture of intimate fondness.
 Then, with  a new thought, he got out his cigarette-case and lighted a cigarette,  after which he resumed his former leaning over the woman as would the  ardent lover.
 He heard the noise again presently, now so near that  he made sure of being overheard, so at once he spoke with a forced  cheerfulness in his inflection.
    "I tell you, Mary," he declared, "everything's going to be all right for  you and me.
 It was bully of you to come here to me like this.
"    The girl made no response.
 She lived still in the nightmare of  murder--that nightmare wherein she had seen Griggs fall dead to the  floor.
    Dick, in nervous apprehension as to the issue, sought to bring her to  realization of the new need that had come upon them.
    "Talk to me," he commanded, very softly.
 "They'll be here in a minute.
  When they come in, pretend you just came here in order to meet me.
 Try,  Mary.
 You must, dearest!" Then, again, his voice rose to loudness, as he  continued.
 "Why, I've been trying all day to see you.
 And, now, here we  are together, just as I was beginning to get really discouraged.
.
.
.
 I  know my father will eventually----"    He was interrupted by the swift swinging open of the hallway door.
 Burke  stood just within the library, a revolver pointed menacingly.
    "Hands up!--all of you!" The Inspector's voice fairly roared the  command.
    The belligerent expression of his face vanished abruptly, as his eyes  fell on Dick standing by the couch and Mary reclining there in limp  helplessness.
 His surprise would have been ludicrous but for the  seriousness of the situation to all concerned.
 Burke's glance roved the  room sharply, and he was quickly convinced that these two were in fact  the only present spoil of his careful plotting.
 His face set grimly, for  the disappointment of this minute surged fiercely within him.
 He started  to speak, his eyes lowering as he regarded the two before him.
    But Dick forestalled him.
 He spoke in a voice coldly repellent.
    "What are you doing in this house at this time of night?" he demanded.
  His manner was one of stern disapproval.
 "I recognize you, Inspector  Burke.
 But you must understand that there are limits even to what you  can do.
 It seems to me, sir, that you exceed your authority by such an  intrusion as this.
"    Burke, however, was not a whit dismayed by the rebuke and the air of  rather contemptuous disdain with which it was uttered.
 He waved his  revolver toward Mary, merely as a gesture of inquisitiveness, without  any threat.
    "What's she doing here?" he asked.
 There was wrath in his rough voice,  for he could not avoid the surmise that his shrewdly concocted scheme to  entrap this woman had somehow been set awry.
 "What's she doing here, I  say?" he repeated heavily.
 His keen eyes were darting once more about  the room, questing some clue to this disturbing mystery, so hateful to  his pride.
    Dick's manner became that of the devoted husband offended by impertinent  obtrusion.
    "You forget yourself, Inspector," he said, icily.
 "This is my wife.
 She  has the right to be with me--her husband!"    The Inspector grinned sceptically.
 He was moved no more effectively by  Mary's almost hysterical effort to respond to her husband's leading.
    "Why shouldn't I be here? Why? Why? I----"    Burke broke in on the girl's pitiful histrionics ruthlessly.
 He was  not in the least deceived.
 He was aware that something untoward, as he  deemed it, had occurred.
 It seemed to him, in fact, that his finical  mechanisms for the undoing of Mary Turner were in a fair way to be  thwarted.
 But he would not give up the cause without a struggle.
 Again,  he addressed himself to Dick, disregarding completely the aloof manner  of the young man.
    "Where's your father?" he questioned roughly.
    "In bed, naturally," was the answer.
 "I ask you again: What are you  doing here at this time of night?"    Burke shook his shoulders ponderously in a movement of impatience over  this prolonging of the farce.
    "Oh, call your father," he directed disgustedly.
    Dick remonstrated with an excellent show of dignity.
    "It's late," he objected.
 "I'd rather not disturb him, if you don't  mind.
 Really, the idea is absurd, you know.
" Suddenly, he smiled very  winningly, and spoke with a good assumption of ingenuousness.
    "Inspector," he said briskly, "I see, I'll have to tell you the truth.
  It's this: I've persuaded my wife to go away with me.
 She's going to  give all that other sort of thing up.
 Yes, we're going away together.
"  There was genuine triumph in his voice now.
 "So, you see, we've got  to talk it over.
 Now, then, Inspector, if you'll come back in the  morning----"    The official grinned sardonically.
 He could not in the least guess just  what had in very deed happened, but he was far too clever a man to be  bamboozled by Dick's maunderings.
    "Oh, that's it!" he exclaimed, with obvious incredulity.
    "Of course," Dick replied bravely, though he knew that the Inspector  disbelieved his pretenses.
 Still, for his own part, he was inclined  as yet to be angry rather than alarmed by this failure to impress the  officer.
 "You see, I didn't know----"    And even in the moment of his saying, the white beam of the flashing  searchlight from the Tower fell between the undrawn draperies of the  octagonal window.
 The light startled the Inspector again, as it had done  once before that same night.
 His gaze followed it instinctively.
 So,  within the second, he saw the still form lying there on the floor--lying  where had been shadows, where now, for the passing of an instant, was  brilliant radiance.
    There was no mistaking that awful, motionless, crumpled posture.
 The  Inspector knew in this single instant of view that murder had been done  here.
 Even as the beam of light from the Tower shifted and vanished from  the room, he leaped to the switch by the door, and turned on the lights  of the chandelier.
 In the next moment, he had reached the door of the  passage across the room, and his whistle sounded shrill.
 His voice  bellowed reinforcement to the blast.
    "Cassidy! Cassidy!"    As Dick made a step toward his wife, from whom he had withdrawn a little  in his colloquy with the official, Burke voiced his command viciously:    "Stay where you are--both of you!"    Cassidy came rushing in, with the other detectives.
 He was plainly  surprised to find the room so nearly empty, where he had expected to  behold a gang of robbers.
    "Why, what's it all mean, Chief?" he questioned.
 His peering eyes fell  on Dick, standing beside Mary, and they rounded in amazement.
    "They've got Griggs!" Burke answered.
 There was exceeding rage in his  voice, as he spoke from his kneeling posture beside the body, to which  he had hurried after the summons to his aides.
 He glowered up into the  bewildered face of the detective.
 "I'll break you for this, Cassidy,"  he declared fiercely.
 "Why didn't you get here on the run when you heard  the shot?"    "But there wasn't any shot," the perplexed and alarmed detective  expostulated.
 He fairly stuttered in the earnestness of his  self-defense.
 "I tell you, Chief, there hasn't been a sound.
"    Burke rose to his feet.
 His heavy face was set in its sternest mold.
    "You could drive a hearse through the hole they've made in him," he  rumbled.
 He wheeled on Mary and Dick.
 "So!" he shouted, "now it's  murder!.
.
.
 Well, hand it over.
 Where's the gun?"    Followed a moment's pause.
 Then the Inspector spoke harshly to Cassidy.
  He still felt himself somewhat dazed by this extraordinary event, but  he was able to cope with the situation.
 He nodded toward Dick as he gave  his order: "Search him!"    Before the detective could obey the direction, Dick took the revolver  from his pocket where he had bestowed it, and held it out.
    And it so chanced that at this incriminating crisis for the son, the  father hastily strode within the library.
 He had been aroused by the  Inspector's shouting, and was evidently greatly perturbed.
 His usual  dignified air was marred by a patent alarm.
    "What's all this?" he exclaimed, as he halted and stared doubtfully on  the scene before him.
    Burke, in a moment like this, was no respecter of persons, for all his  judicious attentions on other occasions to those whose influence might  serve him well for benefits received.
    "You can see for yourself," he said grimly to the dumfounded magnate.
  Then, he fixed sinister eyes on the son.
 "So," he went on, with somber  menace in his voice, "you did it, young man.
" He nodded toward the  detective.
 "Well, Cassidy, you can take 'em both down-town.
.
.
.
 That's  all.
"    The command aroused Dick to remonstrance against such indignity toward  the woman whom he loved.
    "Not her!" he cried, imploringly.
 "You don't want her, Inspector! This  is all wrong!"    Now, at last, Mary interposed with a new spirit.
 She had regained,  in some measure at least, her poise.
 She was speaking again with that  mental clarity which was distinctive in her.
    "Dick," she advised quietly, but with underlying urgency in her gently  spoken words, "don't talk, please.
"    Burke laughed harshly.
    "What do you expect?" he inquired truculently.
 "As a matter of fact, the  thing's simple enough, young man.
 Either you killed Griggs, or she did.
"    The Inspector, with his charge, made a careless gesture toward the  corpse of the murdered stool-pigeon.
 For the first time, Edward Gilder,  as his glance unconsciously followed the officer's movement, looked and  saw the ghastly inanimate heap of flesh and bone that had once been a  man.
 He fairly reeled at the gruesome spectacle, then fumbled with an  outstretched hand as he moved stumblingly until he laid hold on a chair,  into which he sank helplessly.
 It suddenly smote upon his consciousness  that he felt very old and broken.
 He marveled dully over the  sensation--it was wholly new to him.
 Then, soon, from a long way off,  he heard the strident voice of the Inspector remorselessly continuing  in the vile, the impossible accusation.
.
.
.
 And that grotesque accusation  was hurled against his only son--the boy whom he so loved.
 The thing  was monstrous, a thing incredible.
 This whole seeming was no more than  a chimera of the night, a phantom of bad dreams, with no truth under  it.
.
.
.
 Yet, the stern voice of the official came with a strange  semblance of reality.
    "Either you killed him," the voice repeated gratingly, "or she did.
  Well, then, young man, did she kill him?"    "Good God, no!" Dick shouted, aghast.
    "Then, it was you!" Such was the Inspector's summary of the case.
    Mary's words came frantically.
 Once again, she was become desperate over  the course of events in this night of fearful happenings.
    "No, no! He didn't!"    Burke's rasping voice reiterated the accusation with a certain  complacency in the inevitability of the dilemma.
    "One of you killed Griggs.
 Which one of you did it?" He scowled at Dick.
  "Did she kill him?"    Again, the husband's cry came with the fierceness of despair over the  fate of the woman.
    "I told you, no!"    The Inspector, always savagely impressive now in voice and look and  gesture, faced the girl with saturnine persistence.
    "Well, then," he blustered, "did he kill him?"    The nod of his head was toward Dick.
 Then, as she remained silent: "I'm  talking to you!" he snapped.
 "Did he kill him?"    The reply came with a soft distinctness that was like a crash of  destiny.
    "Yes.
"    Dick turned to his wife in reproachful amazement.
    "Mary!" he cried, incredulously.
 This betrayal was something  inconceivable from her, since he believed that now at last he knew her  heart.
    Burke, however, as usual, paid no heed to the niceties of sentiment.
  They had small place in his concerns as an official of police.
 His sole  ambition just now was to fix the crime definitely on the perpetrator.
    "You'll swear he killed him?" he asked, briskly, well content with this  concrete result of the entanglement.
    Mary subtly evaded the question, while seeming to give unqualified  assent.
    "Why not?" she responded listlessly.
    At this intolerable assertion as he deemed it, Edward Gilder was  reanimated.
 He sat rigidly erect in his, chair.
 In that frightful  moment, it came to him anew that here was in verity the last detail in a  consummate scheme by this woman for revenge against himself.
    "God!" he cried, despairingly.
 "And that's your vengeance!"    Mary heard, and understood.
 There came an inscrutable smile on her  curving lips, but there was no satisfaction in that smile, as of one who  realized the fruition of long-cherished schemes of retribution.
 Instead,  there was only an infinite sadness, while she spoke very gently.
    "I don't want vengeance--now!" she said.
    "But they'll try my boy for murder," the magnate remonstrated,  distraught.
    "Oh, no, they can't!" came the rejoinder.
 And now, once again, there  was a hint of the quizzical creeping in the smile.
 "No, they can't!"  she repeated firmly, and there was profound relief in her tones since  at last her ingenuity had found a way out of this outrageous situation  thrust on her and on her husband.
    Burke glared at the speaker in a rage that was abruptly grown suspicious  in some vague way.
    "What's the reason we can't?" he stormed.
    Mary sprang to her feet.
 She was radiant with a new serenity, now that  her quick-wittedness had discovered a method for baffling the mesh of  evidence that had been woven about her and Dick through no fault  of their own.
 Her eyes were glowing with even more than their usual  lusters.
 Her voice came softly modulated, almost mocking.
    "Because you couldn't convict him," she said succinctly.
 A contented  smile bent the red graces of her lips.
    Burke sneered an indignation that was, nevertheless, somewhat fearful of  what might lie behind the woman's assurance.
    "What's the reason?" he demanded, scornfully.
 "There's the body.
" He  pointed to the rigid form of the dead man, lying there so very near  them.
 "And the gun was found on him.
 And then, you're willing to swear  that he killed him.
.
.
.
 Well, I guess we'll convict him, all right.
 Why  not?"    Mary's answer was given quietly, but, none the less, with an assurance  that could not be gainsaid.
    "Because," she said, "my husband merely killed a burglar.
" In her turn,  she pointed toward the body of the dead man.
 "That man," she continued  evenly, "was the burglar.
 You know that! My husband shot him in defense  of his home!" There was a brief silence.
 Then, she added, with a  wonderful mildness in the music of her voice.
 "And so, Inspector, as you  know of course, he was within the law!"        .
 WHO SHOT GRIGGS?    In his office next morning, Inspector Burke was fuming over the failure  of his conspiracy.
 He had hoped through this plot to vindicate his  authority, so sadly flaunted by Garson and Mary Turner.
 Instead of  this much-to-be-desired result from his scheming, the outcome had been  nothing less than disastrous.
 The one certain fact was that his most  valuable ally in his warfare against the criminals of the city had been  done to death.
 Some one had murdered Griggs, the stool-pigeon.
 Where  Burke had meant to serve a man of high influence, Edward Gilder, by  railroading the bride of the magnate's son to prison, he had succeeded  only in making the trouble of that merchant prince vastly worse in  the ending of the affair by arresting the son for the capital crime of  murder.
 The situation was, in very truth, intolerable.
 More than ever,  Burke grew hot with intent to overcome the woman who had so persistently  outraged his authority by her ingenious devices against the law.
 Anyhow,  the murder of Griggs could not go unpunished.
 The slayer's identity  must be determined, and thereafter the due penalty of the law inflicted,  whoever the guilty person might prove to be.
 To the discovery of this  identity, the Inspector was at the present moment devoting himself by  adroit questioning of Dacey and Chicago Red, who had been arrested in  one of their accustomed haunts by his men a short time before.
    The policeman on duty at the door was the only other person in the room,  and in consequence Burke permitted himself, quite unashamed, to employ  those methods of persuasion which have risen to a high degree of  admiration in police circles.
    "Come across now!" he admonished.
 His voice rolled forth like that of a  bull of Bashan.
 He was on his feet, facing the two thieves.
 His head was  thrust forward menacingly, and his eyes were savage.
 The two men shrank  before him--both in natural fear, and, too, in a furtive policy of their  own.
 This was no occasion for them to assert a personal pride against  the man who had them in his toils.
    "I don't know nothin'!" Chicago Red's voice was between a snarl and a  whine.
 "Ain't I been telling you that for over an hour?"    Burke vouchsafed no answer in speech, but with a nimbleness surprising  in one of his bulk, gave Dacey, who chanced to be the nearer of the two,  a shove that sent the fellow staggering half-way across the room under  its impetus.
    With this by way of appreciable introduction to his seriousness of  purpose, Burke put a question:    "Dacey, how long have you been out?"    The answer came in a sibilant whisper of dread.
    "A week.
"    Burke pushed the implication brutally.
    "Want to go back for another stretch?" The Inspector's voice was  freighted with suggestions of disasters to come, which were well  understood by the cringing wretch before him.
    The thief shuddered, and his face, already pallid from the prison lack  of sunlight like some noxious growth of a cellar, became livid.
 His  words came in a muffled moan of fear.
    "God, no!"    Burke left a little interval of silence then in which the thieves  might tremble over the prospect suggested by his words, but always he  maintained his steady, relentless glare on the cowed creatures.
 It was  a familiar warfare with him.
 Yet, in this instance, he was destined  to failure, for the men were of a type different from that of English  Eddie, who was lying dead as the meet reward for treachery to his  fellows.
.
.
.
 When, at last, his question issued from the close-shut lips,  it came like the crack of a gun.
    "Who shot Griggs?"    The reply was a chorus from the two:    "I don't know--honest, I don't!"    In his eagerness, Chicago Red moved toward his questioner--unwisely.
    "Honest to Gawd, I don't know nothin' about it!"    The Inspector's fist shot out toward Chicago Red's jaw.
 The impact was  enough.
 The thief went to his knees under the blow.
    "Now, get up--and talk!" Burke's voice came with unrepentant noisiness  against the stricken man.
    Cringingly, Chicago Red, who so gloried in his strength, yet was now  altogether humble in this precarious case, obeyed as far as the getting  to his feet was concerned.
.
.
.
 It never occurred to him even that he  should carry his obedience to the point of "squealing on a pal!" Had  the circumstances been different, he might have refused to accept the  Inspector's blow with such meekness, since above all things he loved  a bit of bodily strife with some one near his own strength, and the  Inspector was of a sort to offer him a battle worth while.
    So, now, while he got slowly to his feet, he took care to keep at a  respectful distance from the official, though his big hands fairly ached  to double into fists for blows with this man who had so maltreated him.
    His own self-respect, of its peculiar sort, was saved by the  interference of Cassidy, who entered the Inspector's office to announce  the arrival of the District Attorney.
    "Send 'im in," Burke directed at once.
 He made a gesture toward the  doorman, and added: "Take 'em back!"    A grin of evil humor writhed the lips of the police official, and he  added to the attentive doorman a word of direction that might well be  interpreted by the malevolent expression on his face.
    "Don't be rough with 'em, Dan," he said.
 For once, his dominating  voice was reduced to something approaching softness, in his sardonic  appreciation of his own humor in the conception of what these two men,  who had ventured to resist his importunities, might receive at the hands  of his faithful satellites.
.
.
.
 The doorman grinned appreciatively, and  herded his victims from the place.
 And the two went shamblingly in sure  knowledge of the things that were in store.
 Yet, without thought of  treachery.
 They would not "squeal"! All they would tell of the death of  Eddie Griggs would be: "He got what was coming to him!"    The Inspector dropped into his swivel chair at the desk whilst he  awaited the arrival of Demarest, the District Attorney.
 The greetings  between the two were cordial when at last the public prosecutor made his  appearance.
    "I came as soon as I got your message," the District Attorney said, as  he seated himself in a chair by the desk.
 "And I've sent word to Mr.  Gilder.
.
.
.
 Now, then, Burke, let's have this thing quickly.
"    The Inspector's explanation was concise:    "Joe Garson, Chicago Red, and Dacey, along with Griggs, broke into  Edward Gilder's house, last night! I knew the trick was going to be  pulled off, and so I planted Cassidy and a couple of other men just  outside the room where the haul was to be made.
 Then, I went away,  and after something like half an hour I came back to make the arrests  myself.
" A look of intense disgust spread itself over the Inspector's  massive face.
 "Well," he concluded sheepishly, "when I broke into the  room I found young Gilder along with that Turner woman he married, and  they were just talking together.
"    "No trace of the others?" Demarest questioned crisply.
    At the inquiry, Burke's face crimsoned angrily, then again set in grim  lines.
    "I found Griggs lying on the floor--dead!" Once again the disgust showed  in his expression.
 "The Turner woman says young Gilder shot Griggs  because he broke into the house.
 Ain't that the limit?"    "What does the boy say?" the District Attorney demanded.
    Burke shook his head dispiritedly.
    "Nothing," he answered.
 "She told him not to talk, and so, of course, he  won't, he's such a fool over her.
"    "And what does she say?" Demarest asked.
 He found himself rather amused  by the exceeding chagrin of the Inspector over this affair.
    Burke's voice grew savage as he snapped a reply.
    "Refuses to talk till she sees a lawyer.
" But a touch of cheerfulness  appeared in his tones as he proceeded.
 "We've got Chicago Red and Dacey,  and we'll have Garson before the day's over.
 And, oh, yes, they've  picked up a young girl at the Turner woman's place.
 And we've got one  real clue--for once!" The speaker's expression was suddenly triumphant.
  He opened a drawer of the desk, and took out Garson's pistol, to which  the silencer was still attached.
    "You never saw a gun like that before, eh?" he exclaimed.
    Demarest admitted the fact after a curious examination.
    "I'll bet you never did!" Burke cried, with satisfaction.
 "That thing  on the end is a Maxim silencer.
 There are thousands of them in use on  rifles, but they've never been able to use them on revolvers before.
  This is a specially made gun," he went on admiringly, as he took it  back and slipped it into a pocket of his coat.
 "That thing is absolutely  noiseless.
 I've tried it.
 Well, you see, it'll be an easy thing--easiest  thing in the world!--to trace that silencer attachment.
 Cassidy's  working on that end of the thing now.
"    For a few minutes longer, the two men discussed the details of the  crime, theorizing over the baffling event.
 Then, presently, Cassidy  entered the office, and made report of his investigations concerning the  pistol with the silencer attachment.
    "I got the factory at Hartford on the wire," he explained, "and they  gave me Mr. Maxim himself, the inventor of the silencer.
 He said this  was surely a special gun, which was made for the use of Henry Sylvester,  one of the professors at Yale.
 He wanted it for demonstration purposes.
  Mr. Maxim said the things have never been put on the market, and that  they never will be.
"    "For humane reasons," Demarest commented, nodding approbation.
    "Good thing, too!" Burke conceded.
 "They'd make murder too devilish  easy, and it's easy enough now.
.
.
.
 Well, Cassidy?"    "I got hold of this man, Sylvester," Cassidy went on.
 "I had him on the  'phone, too.
 He says that his house was robbed about eight weeks ago,  and among other things the silencer was stolen.
" Cassidy paused, and  chuckled drily.
 "He adds the startling information that the New Haven  police have not been able to recover any of the stolen property.
 Them  rube cops are immense!"      Demarest smiled slyly, as the detective, at a nod from his superior,  went toward the door.
    "No," he said, maliciously; "only the New York police recover stolen  goods.
"    "Good-night!" quoth Cassidy, turning at the door, in admission of his  discomfiture over the thrust, while Burke himself grinned wryly in  appreciation of the gibe.
    Demarest grew grave again, as he put the question that was troubling him  most.
    "Is there any chance that young Gilder did shoot Griggs?"    "You can search me!" the Inspector answered, disconsolately.
 "My men  were just outside the door of the room where Eddie Griggs was shot to  death, and none of 'em heard a sound.
 It's that infernal silencer thing.
  Of course, I know that all the gang was in the house.
"    "But tell me just how you know that fact," Demarest objected very  crisply.
 "Did you see them go in?"    "No, I didn't," the Inspector admitted, tartly.
 "But Griggs----"    Demarest permitted himself a sneer born of legal knowledge.
    "Griggs is dead, Burke.
 You're up against it.
 You can't prove that  Garson, or Chicago Red, or Dacey, ever entered that house.
"    The Inspector scowled over this positive statement.
    "But Griggs said they were going to," he argued.
    "I know," Demarest agreed, with an exasperating air of shrewdness; "but  Griggs is dead.
 You see, Burke, you couldn't in a trial even repeat what  he told you.
 It's not permissible evidence.
"    "Oh, the law!" the Inspector snorted, with much choler.
 "Well, then," he  went on belligerently, "I'll charge young Gilder with murder, and call  the Turner woman as a witness.
"    The District Attorney laughed aloud over this project.
    "You can't question her on the witness-stand," he explained  patronizingly to the badgered police official.
 "The law doesn't allow  you to make a wife testify against her husband.
 And, what's more, you  can't arrest her, and then force her to go into the witness-stand,  either.
 No, Burke," he concluded emphatically, "your only chance of  getting the murderer of Griggs is by a confession.
"    "Then, I'll charge them both with the murder," the Inspector growled  vindictively.
 "And, by God, they'll both go to trial unless somebody  comes through.
" He brought his huge fist down on the desk with violence,  and his voice was forbidding.
 "If it's my last act on earth," he  declared, "I'm going to get the man who shot Eddie Griggs.
"    Demarest was seriously disturbed by the situation that had developed.
 He  was under great personal obligations to Edward Gilder, whose influence  in fact had been the prime cause of his success in attaining to the  important official position he now held, and he would have gone far  to serve the magnate in any difficulty that might arise.
 He had been  perfectly willing to employ all the resources of his office to relieve  the son from the entanglement with a woman of unsavory notoriety.
 Now,  thanks to the miscarried plotting of Burke to the like end, what before  had been merely a vicious state of affairs was become one of the utmost  dreadfulness.
 The worst of crimes had been committed in the house of  Edward Gilder himself, and his son acknowledged himself as the murderer.
  The District Attorney felt a genuine sorrow in thinking of the anguish  this event must have brought on the father.
 He had, as well, sympathy  enough for the son.
 His acquaintance with the young man convinced him  that the boy had not done the deed of bloody violence.
 In that fact was  a mingling of comfort and of anxiety.
 It had been better, doubtless,  if indeed Dick had shot Griggs, had indicted a just penalty on a  housebreaker.
 But the District Attorney was not inclined to credit the  confession.
 Burke's account of the plot in which the stool-pigeon had  been the agent offered too many complications.
 Altogether, the aspect of  the case served to indicate that Dick could not have been the slayer.
.
.
.
  Demarest shook his head dejectedly.
    "Burke," he said, "I want the boy to go free.
 I don't believe for a  minute that Dick Gilder ever killed this pet stool-pigeon of yours.
 And,  so, you must understand this: I want him to go free, of course.
"    Burke frowned refusal at this suggestion.
 Here was a matter in which his  rights must not be invaded.
 He, too, would have gone far to serve a man  of Edward Gilder's standing, but in this instance his professional pride  was in revolt.
 He had been defied, trapped, made a victim of the gang  who had killed his most valued informer.
    "The youngster'll go free when he tells what he knows," he said angrily,  "and not a minute before.
" His expression lightened a little.
 "Perhaps  the old gentleman can make him talk.
 I can't.
 He's under that woman's  thumb, of course, and she's told him he mustn't say a word.
 So, he  don't.
" A grin of half-embarrassed appreciation moved the heavy jaws as  he glanced at the District Attorney.
 "You see," he explained, "I can't  make him talk, but I might if circumstances were different.
 On account  of his being the old man's son, I'm a little cramped in my style.
"    It was, in truth, one thing to browbeat and assault a convict like Dacey  or Chicago Red, but quite another to employ the like violence against  a youth of Dick Gilder's position in the world.
 Demarest understood  perfectly, but he was inclined to be sceptical over the Inspector's  theory that Dick possessed actual cognizance as to the killing of  Griggs.
    "You think that young Gilder really knows?" he questioned, doubtfully.
    "I don't think anything--yet!" Burke retorted.
 "All I know is this:  Eddie Griggs, the most valuable crook that ever worked for me, has been  murdered.
" The official's voice was charged with threatening as he went  on.
 "And some one, man or woman, is going to pay for it!"    "Woman?" Demarest repeated, in some astonishment.
    Burke's voice came merciless.
    "I mean, Mary Turner," he said slowly.
    Demarest was shocked.
    "But, Burke," he expostulated, "she's not that sort.
" The Inspector  sneered openly.
    "How do you know she ain't?" he demanded.
 "Well, anyhow, she's made a  monkey out of the Police Department, and, first, last, and all the time,  I'm a copper.
.
.
 And that reminds me," he went on with a resumption of  his usual curt bluntness, "I want you to wait for Mr. Gilder outside,  while I get busy with the girl they've brought down from Mary Turner's  flat.
"        .
 AGGIE AT BAY.
    Burke, after the lawyer had left him, watched the door expectantly for  the coming of the girl, whom he had ordered brought before him.
 But,  when at last Dan appeared, and stood aside to permit her passing into  the office, the Inspector gasped at the unexpectedness of the vision.
  He had anticipated the coming of a woman of that world with which he was  most familiar in the exercise of his professional duties--the underworld  of criminals, some one beautiful perhaps, but with the brand of  viciousness marked subtly, yet visibly for the trained eye to see.
 Then,  even in that first moment, he told himself that he should have been  prepared for the unusual in this instance, since the girl had to do with  Mary Turner, and that disturbing person herself showed in face and form  and manner nothing to suggest aught but a gentlewoman.
 And, in the next  instant, the Inspector forgot his surprise in a sincere, almost ardent  admiration.
    The girl was rather short, but of a slender elegance of form that was  ravishing.
 She was gowned, too, with a chic nicety to arouse the envy of  all less-fortunate women.
 Her costume had about it an indubitable air,  a finality of perfection in its kind.
 On another, it might have appeared  perhaps the merest trifle garish.
 But that fault, if in fact it ever  existed, was made into a virtue by the correcting innocence of  the girl's face.
 It was a childish face, childish in the exquisite  smoothness of the soft, pink skin, childish in the wondering stare of  the blue eyes, now so widely opened in dismay, childish in the wistful  drooping of the rosebud mouth.
    The girl advanced slowly, with a laggard hesitation in her movements  obviously from fear.
 She approached the desk, from behind which the  Inspector watched, fascinated by the fresh and wholesome beauty of this  young creature.
 He failed to observe the underlying anger beneath the  girl's outward display of alarm.
 He shook off his first impression by  means of a resort to his customary bluster in such cases.
    "Now, then, my girl," he said roughly, "I want to know----"    There came a change, wrought in the twinkling of an eye.
 The tiny,  trimly shod foot of the girl rose and fell in a wrathful stamp.
    "How dare you!" The clear blue eyes were become darkened with anger.
  There was a deepened leaf of red in either cheek.
 The drooping lips  drooped no longer, but were bent to a haughtiness that was finely  impressive.
    Before the offended indignation of the young woman, Burke sat bewildered  by embarrassment for once in his life, and quite at a loss.
    "What's that?" he said, dubiously.
    The girl explained the matter explicitly enough.
    "What do you mean by this outrage?" she stormed.
 Her voice was low  and rich, with a charming roundness that seemed the very hallmark of  gentility.
 But, now, it was surcharged with an indignant amazement over  the indignity put upon her by the representatives of the law.
 Then,  abruptly, the blue eyes were softened in their fires, as by the sudden  nearness of tears.
    "What do you mean?" the girl repeated.
 Her slim form was tense with  wrath.
 "I demand my instant release.
" There was indescribable rebuke in  her slow emphasis of the words.
    Burke was impressed in spite of himself, in spite of his accustomed cold  indifference to the feelings of others as necessity compelled him  to make investigation of them.
 His harsh, blustering voice softened  perceptibly, and he spoke in a wheedling tone, such as one might employ  in the effort to tranquillize a spoiled child in a fit of temper.
    "Wait a minute," he remonstrated.
 "Wait a minute!" He made a pacifically  courteous gesture toward one of the chairs, which stood by an end of the  desk.
 "Sit down," he invited, with an effort toward cajoling.
    The scorn of the girl was superb.
 Her voice came icily, as she answered:    "I shall do nothing of the sort.
 Sit down, indeed!--here! Why, I  have been arrested----" There came a break in the music of her tones  throbbing resentment.
 A little sob crept in, and broke the sequence of  words.
 The dainty face was vivid with shame.
 "I--" she faltered, "I've  been arrested--by a common policeman!"    The Inspector seized on the one flaw left him for defense against her  indictment.
    "No, no, miss," he argued, earnestly.
 "Excuse me.
 It wasn't any common  policeman--it was a detective sergeant.
"    But his effort to placate was quite in vain.
 The ingenuous little beauty  with the child's face and the blue eyes so widely opened fairly panted  in her revolt against the ignominy of her position, and was not to be so  easily appeased.
 Her voice came vibrant with disdain.
 Her level gaze on  the Inspector was of a sort to suggest to him anxieties over possible  complications here.
    "You wait!" she cried violently.
 "You just wait, I tell you, until my  papa hears of this!"    Burke regarded the furious girl doubtfully.
    "Who is your papa?" he asked, with a bit of alarm stirring in his  breast, for he had no mind to offend any one of importance where there  was no need.
    "I sha'n't tell you," came the petulant retort from the girl.
 Her ivory  forehead was wrinkled charmingly in a little frown of obstinacy.
 "Why,"  she went on, displaying new symptoms of distress over another appalling  idea that flashed on her in this moment, "you would probably give my  name to the reporters.
" Once again the rosebud mouth drooped into curves  of sorrow, of a great self-pity.
 "If it ever got into the newspapers, my  family would die of shame!"    The pathos of her fear pierced through the hardened crust of the police  official.
 He spoke apologetically.
    "Now, the easiest way out for both of us," he suggested, "is for you  to tell me just who you are.
 You see, young lady, you were found in the  house of a notorious crook.
"    The haughtiness of the girl waxed.
 It seemed as if she grew an inch  taller in her scorn of the Inspector's saying.
    "How perfectly absurd!" she exclaimed, scathingly.
 "I was calling on  Miss Mary Turner!"    "How did you come to meet her, anyhow?" Burke inquired.
 He still  held his big voice to a softer modulation than that to which it was  habituated.
    Yet, the disdain of the girl seemed only to increase momently.
 She  showed plainly that she regarded this brass-buttoned official as one  unbearably insolent in his demeanor toward her.
 Nevertheless, she  condescended to reply, with an exaggeration of the aristocratic drawl to  indicate her displeasure.
    "I was introduced to Miss Turner," she explained, "by Mr. Richard  Gilder.
 Perhaps you have heard of his father, the owner of the  Emporium.
"    "Oh, yes, I've heard of his father, and of him, too," Burke admitted,  placatingly.
    But the girl relaxed not a whit in her attitude of offense.
    "Then," she went on severely, "you must see at once that you are  entirely mistaken in this matter.
" Her blue eyes widened further as  she stared accusingly at the Inspector, who betrayed evidences of  perplexity, and hesitated for an answer.
 Then, the doll-like, charming  face took on a softer look, which had in it a suggestion of appeal.
    "Don't you see it?" she demanded.
    "Well, no," Burke rejoined uneasily; "not exactly, I don't!" In the  presence of this delicate and graceful femininity, he experienced a  sudden, novel distaste for his usual sledge-hammer methods of attack  in interrogation.
 Yet, his duty required that he should continue his  questioning.
 He found himself in fact between the devil and the deep  sea--though this particular devil appeared rather as an angel of light.
    Now, at his somewhat feeble remark in reply to her query, the childish  face grew as hard as its curving contours would permit.
    "Sir!" she cried indignantly.
 Her little head was thrown back in  scornful reproof, and she turned a shoulder toward the official  contemptuously.
    "Now, now!" Burke exclaimed in remonstrance.
 After all, he could not be  brutal with this guileless maiden.
 He must, however, make the situation  clear to her, lest she think him a beast--which would never do!    "You see, young lady," he went on with a gentleness of voice and manner  that would have been inconceivable to Dacey and Chicago Red; "you see,  the fact is that, even if you were introduced to this Mary Turner by  young Mr. Gilder, this same Mary Turner herself is an ex-convict, and  she's just been arrested for murder.
"    At the dread word, a startling change was wrought in the girl.
 She  wheeled to face the Inspector, her slender body swaying a little toward  him.
 The rather heavy brows were lifted slightly in a disbelieving  stare.
 The red lips were parted, rounded to a tremulous horror.
    "Murder!" she gasped; and then was silent.
    "Yes," Burke went on, wholly at ease now, since he had broken the ice  thus effectually.
 "You see, if there's a mistake about you, you don't  want it to go any further--not a mite further, that's sure.
 So, you see,  now, that's one of the reasons why I must know just who you are.
" Then,  in his turn, Burke put the query that the girl had put to him a little  while before.
 "You see that, don't you?"    "Oh, yes, yes!" was the instant agreement.
 "You should have told me all  about this horrid thing in the first place.
" Now, the girl's manner was  transformed.
 She smiled wistfully on the Inspector, and the glance of  the blue eyes was very kind, subtly alluring.
 Yet in this unbending,  there appeared even more decisively than hitherto the fine qualities  in bearing of one delicately nurtured.
 She sank down in a chair by the  desk, and forthwith spoke with a simplicity that in itself was somehow  peculiarly potent in its effect on the official who gave attentive ear.
    "My name is Helen Travers West," she announced.
    Burke started a little in his seat, and regarded the speaker with a new  deference as he heard that name uttered.
    "Not the daughter of the railway president?" he inquired.
    "Yes," the girl admitted.
 Then, anew, she displayed a serious agitation  over the thought of any possible publicity in this affair.
    "Oh, please, don't tell any one," she begged prettily.
 The blue eyes  were very imploring, beguiling, too.
 The timid smile that wreathed the  tiny mouth was marvelously winning.
 The neatly gloved little hands were  held outstretched, clasped in supplication.
 "Surely, sir, you see now  quite plainly why it must never be known by any one in all the wide,  wide world that I have ever been brought to this perfectly dreadful  place--though you have been quite nice!" Her voice dropped to a note  of musical prayerfulness.
 The words were spoken very softly and very  slowly, with intonations difficult for a man to deny.
 "Please let me go  home.
" She plucked a minute handkerchief from her handbag, put it to her  eyes, and began to sob quietly.
    The burly Inspector of Police was moved to quick sympathy.
 Really, when  all was said and done, it was a shame that one like her should by some  freak of fate have become involved in the sordid, vicious things that  his profession made it obligatory on him to investigate.
 There was a  considerable hint of the paternal in his air as he made an attempt to  offer consolation to the afflicted damsel.
    "That's all right, little lady," he exclaimed cheerfully.
 "Now, don't  you be worried--not a little bit.
 Take it from me, Miss West.
.
.
.
 Just go  ahead, and tell me all you know about this Turner woman.
 Did you see her  yesterday?"    The girl's sobs ceased.
 After a final dab with the minute handkerchief,  she leaned forward a little toward the Inspector, and proceeded to put a  question to him with great eagerness.
    "Will you let me go home as soon as I've told you the teensy little I  know?"    "Yes," Burke agreed promptly, with an encouraging smile.
 And for a good  measure of reassurance, he added as one might to an alarmed child: "No  one is going to hurt you, young lady.
"    "Well, then, you see, it was this way," began the brisk explanation.
  "Mr. Gilder was calling on me one afternoon, and he said to me then that  he knew a very charming young woman, who----"    Here the speech ended abruptly, and once again the handkerchief was  brought into play as the sobbing broke forth with increased violence.
  Presently, the girl's voice rose in a wail.
    "Oh, this is dreadful--dreadful!" In the final word, the wail broke to a  moan.
    Burke felt himself vaguely guilty as the cause of such suffering on the  part of one so young, so fair, so innocent.
 As a culprit, he sought his  best to afford a measure of soothing for this grief that had had its  source in his performance of duty.
    "That's all right, little lady," he urged in a voice as nearly  mellifluous as he could contrive with its mighty volume.
 "That's all  right.
 I have to keep on telling you.
 Nobody's going to hurt you--not a  little bit.
 Believe me! Why, nobody ever would want to hurt you!"    But his well-meant attempt to assuage the stricken creature's wo was  futile.
 The sobbing continued.
 With it came a plaintive cry, many times  repeated, softly, but very miserably.
    "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"    "Isn't there something else you can tell me about this woman?" Burke  inquired in desperation before the plaintive outburst.
 He hoped to  distract her from such grief over her predicament.
    The girl gave no least heed to the question.
    "Oh, I'm so frightened!" she gasped.
    "Tut, tut!" the Inspector chided.
 "Now, I tell you there's nothing at  all for you to be afraid of.
"    "I'm afraid!" the girl asserted dismally.
 "I'm afraid you will--put  me--in a cell!" Her voice sank to a murmur hardly audible as she  spoke the words so fraught with dread import to one of her refined  sensibilities.
    "Pooh!" Burke returned, gallantly.
 "Why, my dear young lady, nobody in  the world could think of you and a cell at the same time--no, indeed!"    Instantly, the girl responded to this bald flattery.
 She fairly radiated  appreciation of the compliment, as she turned her eyes, dewy with tears,  on the somewhat flustered Inspector.
    "Oh, thank you!" she exclaimed, with naive enjoyment.
    Forthwith, Burke set out to make the most of this favorable opportunity.
    "Are you sure you've told me all you know about this woman?" he  questioned.
    "Oh, yes! I've only seen her two or three times," came the ready  response.
 The voice changed to supplication, and again the clasped hands  were extended beseechingly.
    "Oh, please, Commissioner! Won't you let me go home?"    The use of a title higher than his own flattered the Inspector, and he  was moved to graciousness.
 Besides, it was obvious that his police net  in this instance had enmeshed only the most harmless of doves.
 He smiled  encouragingly.
    "Well, now, little lady," he said, almost tenderly, "if I let you  go now, will you promise to let me know if you are able to think of  anything else about this Turner woman?"    "I will--indeed, I will!" came the fervent assurance.
 There was  something almost--quite provocative in the flash of gratitude that shone  forth from the blue eyes of the girl in that moment of her superlative  relief.
 It moved Burke to a desire for rehabilitation in her estimation.
    "Now, you see," he went on in his heavy voice, yet very kindly, and with  a sort of massive playfulness in his manner, "no one has hurt you--not  even a little bit, after all.
 Now, you run right home to your mother.
"    The girl did not need to be told twice.
 On the instant, she sprang up  joyously, and started toward the door, with a final ravishing smile for  the pleased official at the desk.
    "I'll go just as fast as ever I can," the musical voice made assurance  blithely.
    "Give my compliments to your father," Burke requested courteously.
 "And  tell him I'm sorry I frightened you.
"    The girl turned at the door.
.
.
.
 After all, too great haste might be  indiscreet.
    "I will, Commissioner," she promised, with an arch smile.
 "And I know  papa will be so grateful to you for all your kindness to me!"    It was at this critical moment that Cassidy entered from the opposite  side of the office.
 As his eyes fell on the girl at the door across from  him, his stolid face lighted in a grin.
 And, in that same instant of  recognition between the two, the color went out of the girl's face.
 The  little red lips snapped together in a line of supreme disgust against  this vicissitude of fate after all her manoeuverings in the face of the  enemy.
 She stood motionless in wordless dismay, impotent before this  disaster forced on her by untoward chance.
    "Hello, Aggie!" the detective remarked, with a smirk, while the  Inspector stared from one to the other with rounded eyes of wonder, and  his jaw dropped from the stark surprise of this new development.
    The girl returned deliberately to the chair she had occupied through  the interview with the Inspector, and dropped into it weakly.
 Her form  rested there limply now, and the blue eyes stared disconsolately at the  blank wall before her.
 She realized that fate had decreed defeat for her  in the game.
 It was after a minute of silence in which the two men sat  staring that at last she spoke with a savage wrath against the pit into  which she had fallen after her arduous efforts.
    "Ain't that the damnedest luck!"    For a little interval still, Burke turned his glances from the girl to  Cassidy, and then back again to the girl, who sat immobile with her blue  eyes steadfastly fixed on the wall.
 The police official was, in truth,  totally bewildered.
 Here was inexplicable mystery.
 Finally, he addressed  the detective curtly.
    "Cassidy, do you know this woman?"    "Sure, I do!" came the placid answer.
 He went on to explain with the  direct brevity of his kind.
 "She's little Aggie Lynch--con' woman, from  Buffalo--two years for blackmail--did her time at Burnsing.
"    With this succinct narrative concerning the girl who sat mute and  motionless in the chair with her eyes fast on the wall, Cassidy relapsed  into silence, during which he stared rather perplexedly at his chief,  who seemed to be in the throes of unusual emotion.
 As the detective  expressed it in his own vernacular: For the first time in his  experience, the Inspector appeared to be actually "rattled.
"    For a little time, there was silence, the while Burke sat staring at the  averted face of the girl.
 His expression was that of one who has just  undergone a soul-stirring shock.
 Then, presently, he set his features  grimly, rose from his chair, and walked to a position directly in the  front of the girl, who still refused to look in his direction.
    "Young woman----" he began, severely.
 Then, of a sudden he laughed.
  "You picked the right business, all right, all right!" he said, with a  certain enthusiasm.
 He laughed aloud until his eyes were only slits, and  his ample paunch trembled vehemently.
    "Well," he went on, at last, "I certainly have to hand it to you, kid.
  You're a beaut'!"    Aggie sniffed vehemently in rebuke of the gross partiality of fate in  his behalf.
    "Just as I had him goin'!" she said bitterly, as if in self-communion,  without shifting her gaze from the blank surface of the wall.
    Now, however, Burke was reminded once again of his official duties, and  he turned quickly to the attentive Cassidy.
    "Have you got a picture of this young woman?" he asked brusquely.
 And  when Cassidy had replied in the negative, he again faced the adventuress  with a mocking grin--in which mockery, too, was a fair fragment for  himself, who had been so thoroughly within her toils of blandishment.
    "I'd dearly love to have a photograph of you, Miss Helen Travers West,"  he said.
    The speech aroused the stolid detective to a new interest.
    "Helen Travers West?" he repeated, inquiringly.
    "Oh, that's the name she told me," the Inspector explained, somewhat  shamefacedly before this question from his inferior.
 Then he chuckled,  for he had sense of humor sufficient to triumph even over his own  discomfiture in this encounter.
 "And she had me winging, too!" he  confessed.
 "Yes, I admit it.
" He turned to the girl admiringly.
 "You  sure are immense, little one--immense!" He smiled somewhat more in his  official manner of mastery.
 "And now, may I have the honor of asking you  to accept the escort of Mr. Cassidy to our gallery.
"    Aggie sprang to her feet and regarded the Inspector with eyes in which  was now no innocence, such as had beguiled him so recently from those  ingenuous orbs.
    "Oh, can that stuff!" she cried, crossly.
 "Let's get down to business on  the dot--and no frills on it! Keep to cases!"    "Now you're talking," Burke declared, with a new appreciation of the  versatility of this woman--who had not been wasting her time hitherto,  and had no wish to lose it now.
    "You can't do anything to us," Aggie declared, strongly.
 There remained  no trace of the shrinking violet that had been Miss Helen Travers West.
  Now, she revealed merely the business woman engaged in a fight against  the law, which was opposed definitely to her peculiar form of business.
    "You can't do anything to me, and you know you can't!" she went on, with  an almost convincing tranquillity of assertion.
 "Why, I'll be sprung  inside an hour.
" There came a ripple of laughter that reminded the  Inspector of the fashion in which he had been overcome by this woman's  wiles.
 And she spoke with a certitude of conviction that was rather  terrifying to one who had just fallen under the stress of her spells.
    "Why, habeas corpus is my lawyer's middle name!"    "On the level, now," the Inspector demanded, quite unmoved by the final  declarations, "when did you see Mary Turner last?"    Aggie resorted anew to her practices of deception.
 Her voice held the  accents of unimpeachable truth, and her eyes looked unflinchingly into  those of her questioner as she answered.
    "Early this morning," she declared.
 "We slept together last night,  because I had the willies.
 She blew the joint about half-past ten.
"    Burke shook his head, more in sorrow than in anger.
    "What's the use of your lying to me?" he remonstrated.
    "What, me?" Aggie clamored, with every evidence of being deeply wounded  by the charge against her veracity.
 "Oh, I wouldn't do anything  like that--on the level! What would be the use? I couldn't fool you,  Commissioner.
"    Burke stroked his chin sheepishly, under the influence of memories of  Miss Helen Travers West.
    "So help me," Aggie continued with the utmost solemnity, "Mary never  left the house all night.
 I'd swear that's the truth on a pile of Bibles  a mile high!"    "Have to be higher than that," the Inspector commented, grimly.
 "You  see, Aggie Lynch, Mary Turner was arrested just after midnight.
" His  voice deepened and came blustering.
 "Young woman, you'd better tell all  you know.
"    "I don't know a thing!" Aggie retorted, sharply.
 She faced the Inspector  fiercely, quite unabashed by the fact that her vigorous offer to commit  perjury had been of no avail.
    Burke, with a quick movement, drew the pistol from his pocket and  extended it toward the girl.
    "How long has she owned this gun?" he said, threateningly.
    Aggie showed no trace of emotion as her glance ran over the weapon.
    "She didn't own it," was her firm answer.
    "Oh, then it's Garson's!" Burke exclaimed.
    "I don't know whose it is," Aggie replied, with an air of boredom well  calculated to deceive.
 "I never laid eyes on it till now.
"    The Inspector's tone abruptly took on a somber coloring, with an  underlying menace.
    "English Eddie was killed with this gun last night," he said.
 "Now, who  did it?" His broad face was sinister.
 "Come on, now! Who did it?"    Aggie became flippant, seemingly unimpressed by the Inspector's  savageness.
    "How should I know?" she drawled.
 "What do you think I am--a  fortune-teller?"    "You'd better come through," Burke reiterated.
 Then his manner changed  to wheedling.
 "If you're the wise kid I think you are, you will.
"    Aggie waxed very petulant over this insistence.
    "I tell you, I don't know anything! Say, what are you trying to hand me,  anyway?"    Burke scowled on the girl portentously, and shook his head.
    "Now, it won't do, I tell you, Aggie Lynch.
 I'm wise.
 You listen to me.
"  Once more his manner turned to the cajoling.
 "You tell me what you know,  and I'll see you make a clean get-away, and I'll slip you a nice little  piece of money, too.
"    The girl's face changed with startling swiftness.
 She regarded the  Inspector shrewdly, a crafty glint in her eyes.
    "Let me get this straight," she said.
 "If I tell you what I know about  Mary Turner and Joe Garson, I get away?"    "Clean!" Burke ejaculated, eagerly.
    "And you'll slip me some coin, too?"    "That's it!" came the hasty assurance.
 "Now, what do you say?"    The small figure grew tense.
 The delicate, childish face was suddenly  distorted with rage, a rage black and venomous.
 The blue eyes were  blazing.
 The voice came thin and piercing.
    "I say, you're a great big stiff! What do you think I am?" she stormed  at the discomfited Inspector, while Cassidy looked on in some enjoyment  at beholding his superior being worsted.
 Aggie wheeled on the detective.
  "Say, take me out of here," she cried in a voice surcharged with  disgust.
 "I'd rather be in the cooler than here with him!"    Now Burke's tone was dangerous.
    "You'll tell," he growled, "or you'll go up the river for a stretch.
"    "I don't know anything," the girl retorted, spiritedly.
 "And, if I did,  I wouldn't tell--not in a million years!" She thrust her head forward  challengingly as she faced the Inspector, and her expression was  resolute.
 "Now, then," she ended, "send me up--if you can!"    "Take her away," Burke snapped to the detective.
    Aggie went toward Cassidy without any sign of reluctance.
    "Yes, do, please!" she exclaimed with a sneer.
 "And do it in a hurry.
  Being in the room with him makes me sick! She turned to stare at the  Inspector with eyes that were very clear and very hard.
 In this moment,  there was nothing childish in their gaze.
    "Thought I'd squeal, did you?" she said, evenly.
 "Yes, I will"--the red  lips bent to a smile of supreme scorn--"like hell!"        .
 THE TRAP THAT FAILED.
    Burke, despite his quality of heaviness, was blest with a keen sense of  humor, against which at times his professional labors strove mutinously.
  In the present instance, he had failed utterly to obtain any information  of value from the girl whom he had just been examining.
 On the contrary,  he had been befooled outrageously by a female criminal, in a manner to  wound deeply his professional pride.
 Nevertheless, he bore no grudge  against the adventuress.
 His sense of the absurd served him well, and he  took a lively enjoyment in recalling the method by which her plausible  wiles had beguiled him.
 He gave her a real respect for the adroitness  with which she had deceived him--and he was not one to be readily  deceived.
 So, now, as the scornful maiden went out of the door under the  escort of Cassidy, Burke bowed gallantly to her lithe back, and blew  a kiss from his thick fingertips, in mocking reverence for her as  an artist in her way.
 Then, he seated himself, pressed the desk  call-button, and, when he had learned that Edward Gilder was arrived,  ordered that the magnate and the District Attorney be admitted, and that  the son, also, be sent up from his cell.
    "It's a bad business, sir," Burke said, with hearty sympathy, to the  shaken father, after the formal greetings that followed the entrance of  the two men.
 "It's a very bad business.
"    "What does he say?" Gilder questioned.
 There was something pitiful  in the distress of this man, usually so strong and so certain of his  course.
 Now, he was hesitant in his movements, and his mellow voice came  more weakly than its wont.
 There was a pathetic pleading in the dulled  eyes with which he regarded the Inspector.
    "Nothing!" Burke answered.
 "That's why I sent for you.
 I suppose Mr.  Demarest has made the situation plain to you.
"    Gilder nodded, his face miserable.
    "Yes," he has explained it to me, he said in a lifeless voice.
 "It's  a terrible position for my boy.
 But you'll release him at once, won't  you?" Though he strove to put confidence into his words, his painful  doubt was manifest.
    "I can't," Burke replied, reluctantly, but bluntly.
 "You ought not to  expect it, Mr. Gilder.
"    "But," came the protest, delivered with much more spirit, "you know very  well that he didn't do it!"    Burke shook his head emphatically in denial of the allegation.
    "I don't know anything about it--yet," he contradicted.
    The face of the magnate went white with fear.
    "Inspector," he cried brokenly, "you--don't mean--"    Burke answered with entire candor.
    "I mean, Mr. Gilder, that you've got to make him talk.
 That's what I  want you to do, for all our sakes.
 Will you?"    "I'll do my best," the unhappy man replied, forlornly.
    A minute later, Dick, in charge of an officer, was brought into the  room.
 He was pale, a little disheveled from his hours in a cell.
 He  still wore his evening clothes of the night before.
 His face showed  clearly the deepened lines, graven by the suffering to which he had been  subjected, but there was no weakness in his expression.
 Instead, a new  force that love and sorrow had brought out in his character was plainly  visible.
 The strength of his nature was springing to full life under the  stimulus of the ordeal through which he was passing.
    The father went forward quickly, and caught Dick's hands in a mighty  grip.
    "My boy!" he murmured, huskily.
 Then, he made a great effort, and  controlled his emotion to some extent.
 "The Inspector tells me," he went  on, "that you've refused to talk--to answer his questions.
"    Dick, too, winced under the pain of this meeting with his father in  a situation so sinister.
 But he was, to some degree, apathetic from  over-much misery.
 Now, in reply to his father's words, he only nodded a  quiet assent.
    "That wasn't wise under the circumstances," the father remonstrated  hurriedly.
 "However, now, Demarest and I are here to protect your  interests, so that you can talk freely.
" He went on with a little catch  of anxiety in his voice.
 "Now, Dick, tell us! Who killed that man? We  must know.
 Tell me.
"    Burke broke in impatiently, with his blustering fashion of address.
    "Where did you get----?"    But Demarest raised a restraining hand.
    "Wait, please!" he admonished the Inspector.
 "You wait a bit.
" He went  a step toward the young man.
 "Give the boy a chance," he said, and his  voice was very friendly as he went on speaking.
 "Dick, I don't want to  frighten you, but your position is really a dangerous one.
 Your only  chance is to speak with perfect frankness.
 I pledge you my word, I'm  telling the truth, Dick.
" There was profound concern in the lawyer's  thin face, and his voice, trained to oratorical arts, was emotionally  persuasive.
 "Dick, my boy, I want you to forget that I'm the District  Attorney, and remember only that I'm an old friend of yours, and of your  father's, who is trying very hard to help you.
 Surely, you can trust me.
  Now, Dick, tell me: Who shot Griggs?"    There came a long pause.
 Burke's face was avid with desire for  knowledge, with the keen expectancy of the hunter on the trail, which  was characteristic of him in his professional work.
 The District  Attorney himself was less vitally eager, but his curiosity, as well as  his wish to escape from an embarrassing situation, showed openly on  his alert countenance.
 The heavy features of the father were twisting  a little in nervous spasms, for to him this hour was all anguish, since  his only son was in such horrible plight.
 Dick alone seemed almost  tranquil, though the outward calm was belied by the flickering of his  eyelids and the occasional involuntary movement of the lips.
 Finally he  spoke, in a cold, weary voice.
    "I shot Griggs," he said.
    Demarest realized subtly that his plea had failed, but he made ar effort  to resist the impression, to take the admission at its face value.
    "Why?" he demanded.
    Dick's answer came in the like unmeaning tones, and as wearily.
    "Because I thought he was a burglar.
"    The District Attorney was beginning to feel his professional pride  aroused against this young man who so flagrantly repelled his attempts  to learn the truth concerning the crime that had been committed.
 He  resorted to familiar artifices for entangling one questioned.
    "Oh, I see!" he said, in a tone of conviction.
 "Now, let's go back a  little.
 Burke says you told him last night that you had persuaded your  wife to come over to the house, and join you there.
 Is that right?"    "Yes.
" The monosyllable was uttered indifferently.
 "And, while the two  of you were talking," Demarest continued in a matter-of-fact manner.
 He  did not conclude the sentence, but asked instead: "Now, tell me, Dick,  just what did happen, won't you?"    There was no reply; and, after a little interval, the lawyer resumed his  questioning.
    "Did this burglar come into the room?"    Dick nodded an assent.
    "And he attacked you?"    There came another nod of affirmation.
    "And there was a struggle?"    "Yes," Dick said, and now there was resolution in his answer.
    "And you shot him?" Demarest asked, smoothly.
    "Yes," the young man said again.
    "Then," the lawyer countered on the instant, "where did you get the  revolver?"    Dick started to answer without thought:    "Why, I grabbed it----" Then, the significance of this crashed on his  consciousness, and he checked the words trembling on his lips.
 His eyes,  which had been downcast, lifted and glared on the questioner.
 "So," he  said with swift hostility in his voice, "so, you're trying to trap me,  too!" He shrugged his shoulders in a way he had learned abroad.
 "You!  And you talk of friendship.
 I want none of such friendship.
"    Demarest, greatly disconcerted, was skilled, nevertheless, in  dissembling, and he hid his chagrin perfectly.
 There was only reproach  in his voice as he answered stoutly:    "I am your friend, Dick.
"    But Burke would be no longer restrained.
 He had listened with increasing  impatience to the diplomatic efforts of the District Attorney, which had  ended in total rout.
 Now, he insisted on employing his own more drastic,  and, as he believed, more efficacious, methods.
 He stood up, and spoke  in his most threatening manner.
    "You don't want to take us for fools, young man," he said, and his big  tones rumbled harshly through the room.
 "If you shot Griggs in mistake  for a burglar, why did you try to hide the fact? Why did you pretend  to me that you and your wife were alone in the room--when you had _that_  there with you, eh? Why didn't you call for help? Why didn't you  call for the police, as any honest man would naturally under such  circumstances?"    The arraignment was severely logical.
 Dick showed his appreciation of  the justice of it in the whitening of his face, nor did he try to answer  the charges thus hurled at him.
    The father, too, appreciated the gravity of the situation.
 His face was  working, as if toward tears.
    "We're trying to save you," he pleaded, tremulously.
    Burke persisted in his vehement system of attack.
 Now, he again brought  out the weapon that had done Eddie Griggs to death.
    "Where'd you get this gun?" he shouted.
    Dick held his tranquil pose.
    "I won't talk any more," he answered, simply.
 "I must see my wife  first.
" His voice became more aggressive.
 "I want to know what you've  done to her.
"    Burke seized on this opening.
    "Did she kill Griggs?" he questioned, roughly.
    For once, Dick was startled out of his calm.
    "No, no!" he cried, desperately.
    Burke followed up his advantage.
    "Then, who did?" he demanded, sharply.
 "Who did?"    Now, however, the young man had regained his self-control.
 He answered  very quietly, but with an air of finality.
    "I won't say any more until I've talked with a lawyer whom I can trust.
"  He shot a vindictive glance toward Demarest.
    The father intervened with a piteous eagerness.
    "Dick, if you know who killed this man, you must speak to protect  yourself.
"    Burke's voice came viciously.
    "The gun was found on you.
 Don't forget that.
"    "You don't seem to realize the position you're in," the father insisted,  despairingly.
 "Think of me, Dick, my boy.
 If you won't speak for your  own sake, do it for mine.
"    The face of the young man softened as he met his father's beseeching  eyes.
    "I'm sorry, Dad," he said, very gently.
 "But I--well, I can't!"    Again, Burke interposed.
 His busy brain was working out a new scheme for  solving this irritating problem.
    "I'm going to give him a little more time to think things over,"  he said, curtly.
 He went back to his chair.
 "Perhaps he'll get to  understand the importance of what we've been saying pretty soon.
" He  scowled at Dick.
 "Now, young man," he went on briskly, "you want to do  a lot of quick thinking, and a lot of honest thinking, and, when you're  ready to tell the truth, let me know.
"    He pressed the button on his desk, and, as the doorman appeared,  addressed that functionary.
    "Dan, have one of the men take him back.
 You wait outside.
"    Dick, however, did not move.
 His voice came with a note of  determination.
    "I want to know about my wife.
 Where is she?"    Burke disregarded the question as completely as if it had not been  uttered, and went on speaking to the doorman with a suggestion in his  words that was effective.
    "He's not to speak to any one, you understand.
" Then he condescended to  give his attention to the prisoner.
 "You'll know all about your wife,  young man, when you make up your mind to tell me the truth.
"    Dick gave no heed to the Inspector's statement.
 His eyes were fixed on  his father, and there was a great tenderness in their depths.
 And he  spoke very softly:    "Dad, I'm sorry!"    The father's gaze met the son's, and the eyes of the two locked.
 There  was no other word spoken.
 Dick turned, and followed his custodian out  of the office in silence.
 Even after the shutting of the door behind the  prisoner, the pause endured for some moments.
    Then, at last, Burke spoke to the magnate.
    "You see, Mr. Gilder, what we're up against.
 I can't let him go--yet!"    The father strode across the room in a sudden access of rage.
    "He's thinking of that woman," he cried out, in a loud voice.
 "He's  trying to shield her.
"    "He's a loyal kid, at that," Burke commented, with a grudging  admiration.
 "I'll say that much for him.
" His expression grew morose, as  again he pressed the button on his desk.
 "And now," he vouchsafed, "I'll  show you the difference.
" Then, as the doorman reappeared, he gave his  order: "Dan, have the Turner woman brought up.
" He regarded the two men  with his bristling brows pulled down in a scowl.
 "I'll have to try a  different game with her," he said, thoughtfully.
 "She sure is one clever  little dame.
 But, if she didn't do it herself, she knows who did, all  right.
" Again, Burke's voice took on its savage note.
 "And some one's  got to pay for killing Griggs.
 I don't have to explain why to Mr.  Demarest, but to you, Mr. Gilder.
 You see, it's this way: The very  foundations of the work done by this department rest on the use of  crooks, who are willing to betray their pals for coin.
 I told you a  bit about it last night.
 Now, you understand, if Griggs's murder  goes unpunished, it'll put the fear of God into the heart of every  stool-pigeon we employ.
 And then where'd we be? Tell me that!"    The Inspector next called his stenographer, and gave explicit  directions.
 At the back of the room, behind the desk, were three large  windows, which opened on a corridor, and across this was a tier of  cells.
 The stenographer was to take his seat in this corridor, just  outside one of the windows.
 Over the windows, the shades were drawn, so  that he would remain invisible to any one within the office, while yet  easily able to overhear every word spoken in the room.
    When he had completed his instructions to the stenographer, Burke turned  to Gilder and Demarest.
    "Now, this time," he said energetically, "I'll be the one to do the  talking.
 And get this: Whatever you hear me say, don't you be surprised.
  Remember, we're dealing with crooks, and, when you're dealing with  crooks, you have to use crooked ways.
"    There was a brief period of silence.
 Then, the door opened, and Mary  Turner entered the office.
 She walked slowly forward, moving with the  smooth strength and grace that were the proof of perfect health and of  perfect poise, the correlation of mind and body in exactness.
 Her form,  clearly revealed by the clinging evening dress, was a curving group of  graces.
 The beauty of her face was enhanced, rather than lessened, by  the pallor of it, for the fading of the richer colors gave to the fine  features an expression more spiritual, made plainer the underlying  qualities that her accustomed brilliance might half-conceal.
 She paid  absolutely no attention to the other two in the room, but went straight  to the desk, and there halted, gazing with her softly penetrant eyes of  deepest violet into the face of the Inspector.
    Under that intent scrutiny, Burke felt a challenge, set himself to match  craft with craft.
 He was not likely to undervalue the wits of one  who had so often flouted him, who, even now, had placed him in a  preposterous predicament by this entanglement over the death of a spy.
  But he was resolved to use his best skill to disarm her sophistication.
  His large voice was modulated to kindliness as he spoke in a casual  manner.
    "I just sent for you to tell you that you're free.
"    Mary regarded the speaker with an impenetrable expression.
 Her tones as  she spoke were quite as matter-of-fact as his own had been.
 In them was  no wonder, no exultation.
    "Then, I can go," she said, simply.
    "Sure, you can go," Burke replied, amiably.
    Without any delay, yet without any haste, Mary glanced toward Gilder  and Demarest, who were watching the scene closely.
 Her eyes were somehow  appraising, but altogether indifferent.
 Then, she went toward the outer  door of the office, still with that almost lackadaisical air.
    Burke waited rather impatiently until she had nearly reached the door  before he shot his bolt, with a fine assumption of carelessness in the  announcement.
    "Garson has confessed!"    Mary, who readily enough had already guessed the essential hypocrisy of  all this play, turned and confronted the Inspector, and answered without  the least trace of fear, but with the firmness of knowledge:    "Oh, no, he hasn't!"    Her attitude exasperated Burke.
 His voice roared out wrathfully.
    "What's the reason he hasn't?"    The music in the tones of the answer was a vocal rebuke.
    "Because he didn't do it.
" She stated the fact as one without a hint of  any contradictory possibility.
    "Well, he says he did it!" Burke vociferated, still more loudly.
    Mary, in her turn, resorted to a bit of finesse, in order to learn  whether or not Garson had been arrested.
 She spoke with a trace of  indignation.
    "But how could he have done it, when he went----" she began.
    The Inspector fell a victim to her superior craft.
 His question came  eagerly.
    "Where did he go?"    Mary smiled for the first time since she had been in the room, and in  that smile the Inspector realized his defeat in the first passage of  this game of intrigue between them.
    "You ought to know," she said, sedately, "since you have arrested him,  and he has confessed.
"    Demarest put up a hand to conceal his smile over the police official's  chagrin.
 Gilder, staring always at this woman who had come to be his  Nemesis, was marveling over the beauty and verve of the one so hating  him as to plan the ruin of his life and his son's.
    Burke was frantic over being worsted thus.
 To gain a diversion, he  reverted to his familiar bullying tactics.
 His question burst raspingly.
  It was a question that had come to be constant within his brain during  the last few hours, one that obsessed him, that fretted him sorely,  almost beyond endurance.
    "Who shot Griggs?" he shouted.
    Mary rested serene in the presence of this violence.
 Her answer capped  the climax of the officer's exasperation.
    "My husband shot a burglar," she said, languidly.
 And then her insolence  reached its culmination in a query of her own: "Was his name Griggs?" It  was done with splendid art, with a splendid mastery of her own emotions,  for, even as she spoke the words, she was remembering those shuddering  seconds when she had stood, only a few hours ago, gazing down at the  inert bulk that had been a man.
    Burke betook himself to another form of attack.
    "Oh, you know better than that," he declared, truculently.
 "You  see, we've traced the Maxim silencer.
 Garson himself bought it up in  Hartford.
"    For the first time, Mary was caught off her guard.
    "But he told me----" she began, then became aware of her indiscretion,  and checked herself.
    Burke seized on her lapse with avidity.
    "What did he tell you?" he questioned, eagerly.
    Now, Mary had regained her self-command, and she spoke calmly.
    "He told me," she said, without a particle of hesitation, "that he had  never seen one.
 Surely, if he had had anything of the sort, he would  have shown it to me then.
"    "Probably he did, too!" Burke rejoined, without the least suspicion that  his surly utterance touched the truth exactly.
 "Now, see here," he went  on, trying to make his voice affable, though with small success, for he  was excessively irritated by these repeated failures; "I can make it a  lot easier for you if you'll talk.
 Come on, now! Who killed Griggs?"    Mary cast off pretense finally, and spoke malignantly.
    "That's for you to find out," she said, sneering.
    Burke pressed the button on the desk, and, when the doorman appeared,  ordered that the prisoner be returned to her cell.
    But Mary stood rebellious, and spoke with a resumption of her cynical  scorn.
    "I suppose," she said, with a glance of contempt toward Demarest, "that  it's useless for me to claim my constitutional rights, and demand to see  a lawyer?"    Burke, too, had cast off pretense at last.
    "Yes," he agreed, with an evil smirk, "you've guessed it right, the  first time.
"    Mary spoke to the District Attorney.
    "I believe," she said, with a new dignity of bearing, "that such is my  constitutional right, is it not, Mr. Demarest?"    The lawyer sought no evasion of the issue.
 For that matter, he was  coming to have an increasing respect, even admiration, for this young  woman, who endured insult and ignominy with a spirit so sturdy, and  met strategem with other strategem better devised.
 So, now, he made his  answer with frank honesty.
    "It is your constitutional right, Miss Turner.
"    Mary turned her clear eyes on the Inspector, and awaited from that  official a reply that was not forthcoming.
 Truth to tell, Burke was far  from comfortable under that survey.
    "Well, Inspector?" she inquired, at last.
    Burke took refuge, as his wont was when too hard pressed, in a mighty  bellow.
    "The Constitution don't go here!" It was the best he could do, and it  shamed him, for he knew its weakness.
 Again, wrath surged in him, and  it surged high.
 He welcomed the advent of Cassidy, who came hurrying in  with a grin of satisfaction on his stolid face.
    "Say, Chief," the detective said with animation, in response to Burke's  glance of inquiry, "we've got Garson.
"    Mary's face fell, though the change of expression was almost  imperceptible.
 Only Demarest, a student of much experience, observed the  fleeting display of repressed emotion.
 When the Inspector took thought  to look at her, she was as impassive as before.
 Yet, he was minded to  try another ruse in his desire to defeat the intelligence of this woman.
  To this end, he asked Gilder and the District Attorney to withdraw,  while he should have a private conversation with the prisoner.
 As she  listened to his request, Mary smiled again in sphinx-like fashion, and  there was still on her lips an expression that caused the official a  pang of doubt, when, at last, the two were left alone together, and he  darted a surreptitious glance toward her.
 Nevertheless, he pressed on  his device valiantly.
    "Now," he said, with a marked softening of manner, "I'm going to be your  friend.
"    "Are you?" Mary's tone was non-committal.
    "Yes," Burke declared, heartily.
 "And I mean it! Give up the truth about  young Gilder.
 I know he shot Griggs, of course.
 But I'm not taking any  stock in that burglar story--not a little bit! No court would, either.
  What was really back of the killing?" Burke's eyes narrowed cunningly.
  "Was he jealous of Griggs? Well, that's what he might do then.
 He's  always been a worthless young cub.
 A rotten deal like this would  be about his gait, I guess.
.
.
.
 Tell me, now: Why did he shoot Eddie  Griggs?"    There was coarseness a-plenty in the Inspector's pretense, but it  possessed a solitary fundamental virtue: it played on the heart of the  woman whom he questioned, aroused it to wrath in defense of her mate.
 In  a second, all poise fled from this girl whose soul was blossoming in the  blest realization that a man loved her purely, unselfishly.
 Her words  came stumblingly in their haste.
 Her eyes were near to black in their  anger.
    "He didn't kill him! He didn't kill him!" she fairly hissed.
 "Why, he's  the most wonderful man in the world.
 You shan't hurt him! Nobody shall  hurt him! I'll fight to the end of my life for Dick Gilder!"    Burke was beaming joyously.
 At last--a long last!--his finesse had won  the victory over this woman's subtleties.
    "Well, that's just what I thought," he said, with smug content.
 "And  now, then, who did shoot Griggs? We've got every one of the gang.
  They're all crooks.
 See here," he went on, with a sudden change to the  respectful in his manner, "why don't you start fresh? I'll give you  every chance in the world.
 I'm dead on the level with you this time.
"    But he was too late.
 By now, Mary had herself well in hand again, vastly  ashamed of the short period of self-betrayal caused by the official's  artifice against her heart.
 As she listened to the Inspector's  assurances, the mocking expression of her face was not encouraging to  that astute individual, but he persevered manfully.
    "Just you wait," he went on cheerfully, "and I'll prove to you that I'm  on the level about this, that I'm really your friend.
.
.
.
 There was a  letter came for you to your apartment.
 My men brought it down to me.
  I've read it.
 Here it is.
 I'll read it to you!"    He picked up an envelope, which had been lying on the desk, and drew out  the single sheet of paper it contained.
 Mary watched him, wondering much  more than her expression revealed over this new development.
 Then, as  she listened, quick interest touched her features to a new life.
 In her  eyes leaped emotions to make or mar a life.
    This was the letter:    "I can't go without telling you how sorry I am.
 There won't never be a  time that I won't remember it was me got you sent up, that you did time  in my place.
 I ain't going to forgive myself ever, and I swear I'm going  straight always.
    "Your true friend,    "HELEN MORRIS.
"    For once, Burke showed a certain delicacy.
 When he had finished the  reading, he said nothing for a long minute--only, sat with his cunning  eyes on the face of the woman who was immobile there before him.
 And,  as he looked on her in her slender elegance of form and gentlewomanly  loveliness of face, a loveliness intelligent and refined beyond that of  most women, he felt borne in on his consciousness the fact that here  was one to be respected.
 He fought against the impression.
 It was to him  preposterous, for she was one of that underworld against which he was  ruthlessly at war.
 Yet, he could not altogether overcome his instinct  toward a half-reverent admiration.
.
.
.
 And, as the letter proved, she  had been innocent at the outset.
 She had been the victim of a mistaken  justice, made outcast by the law she had never wronged.
.
.
.
 His mood of  respect was inevitable, since he had some sensibilities, though they  were coarsened, and they sensed vaguely the maelstrom of emotions that  now swirled in the girl's breast.
    To Mary Turner, this was the wonderful hour.
 In it, the vindication of  her innocence was made complete.
 The story was there recorded in black  and white on the page written by Helen Morris.
 It mattered little--or  infinitely much!--that it came too late.
 She had gained her evil place  in the world, was a notorious woman in fact, was even now a prisoner  under suspicion of murder.
 Nevertheless, she felt a thrill of ecstasy  over this written document--which it had never occurred to her to wrest  from the girl at the time of the oral confession.
 Now that it had been  proffered, the value of it loomed above almost all things else in the  world.
 It proclaimed undeniably the wrong under which she had suffered.
  She was not the thief the court had adjudged her.
 "Now, there's nobody  here but just you and me.
 Come on, now--put me wise!"    Mary was again the resourceful woman who was glad to pit her brain  against the contriving of those who fought her.
 So, at this moment, she  seemed pliant to the will of the man who urged her thus cunningly.
 Her  quick glance around the office was of a sort to delude the Inspector  into a belief that she was yielding to his lure.
    "Are you sure no one will ever know?" she asked, timorously.
    "Nobody but you and me," Burke declared, all agog with anticipation of  victory at last.
 "I give you my word!"    Mary met the gaze of the Inspector fully.
 In the same instant,  she flashed on him a smile that was dazzling, the smile of a woman  triumphant in her mastery of the situation.
 Her face was radiant,  luminous with honest mirth.
 There was something simple and genuine  in her beauty that thrilled the man before her, the man trying so  vindictively to trap her to her own undoing.
 For all his grossness,  Burke was of shrewd perceptions, and somewhere, half-submerged under  the sordid nature of his calling, was a love of things esthetic, a  responsiveness to the appeals of beauty.
 Now, as his glance searched  the face of the girl who was bubbling with mirth, he experienced an odd  warming of his heart under the spell of her loveliness--a loveliness  wholly feminine, pervasive, wholesome.
 But, too, his soul shook in a  premonition of catastrophe, for there was mischief in the beaming eyes  of softest violet.
 There was a demon of mockery playing in the curves of  the scarlet lips, as she smiled so winsomely.
    All his apprehensions were verified by her utterance.
 It came in a most  casual voice, despite the dancing delight in her face.
 The tones were  drawled in the matter-of-fact fashion of statement that leads a listener  to answer without heed to the exact import of the question, unless very  alert, indeed.
.
.
.
 This is what she said in that so-casual voice:    "I'm not speaking loud enough, am I, stenographer?"    And that industrious writer of shorthand notes, absorbed in his task,  answered instantly from his hidden place in the corridor.
    "No, ma'am, not quite.
"    Mary laughed aloud, while Burke sat dumfounded.
 She rose swiftly, and  went to the nearest window, and with a pull at the cord sent the shade  flying upward.
 For seconds, there was revealed the busy stenographer,  bent over his pad.
 Then, the noise of the ascending shade, which had  been hammering on his consciousness, penetrated, and he looked up.
  Realization came, as he beheld the woman laughing at him through the  window.
 Consternation beset him.
 He knew that, somehow, he had bungled  fatally.
 A groan of distress burst from him, and he fled the place in  ignominious rout.
    There was another whose spirit was equally desirous of flight--Burke!  Yet once again, he was beaten at his own game, his cunning made of no  avail against the clever interpretation of this woman whom he assailed.
  He had no defense to offer.
 He did not care to meet her gaze just  then, since he was learning to respect her as one wronged, where he  had regarded her hitherto merely as of the flotsam and jetsam of the  criminal class.
 So, he avoided her eyes as she stood by the window  regarding him quizzically.
 In a panic of confusion quite new to him in  his years of experience, he pressed the button on his desk.
    The doorman appeared with that automatic precision which made him  valuable in his position, and the Inspector hailed the ready presence  with a feeling of profound relief.
    "Dan, take her back!" he said, feebly.
    Mary was smiling still as she went to the door.
 But she could not resist  the impulse toward retort.
    "Oh, yes," she said, suavely; "you were right on the level with me,  weren't you, Burke? Nobody here but you and me!" The words came in a  sing-song of mockery.
    The Inspector had nothing in the way of answer--only, sat motionless  until the door closed after her.
 Then, left alone, his sole audible  comment was a single word--one he had learned, perhaps, from Aggie  Lynch:    "Hell!"        .
 THE CONFESSION.
    Burke was a persistent man, and he had set himself to getting the  murderer of Griggs.
 Foiled in his efforts thus far by the opposition  of Mary, he now gave himself over to careful thought as to a means  of procedure that might offer the best possibilities of success.
 His  beetling brows were drawn in a frown of perplexity for a full quarter  of an hour, while he rested motionless in his chair, an unlighted  cigar between his lips.
 Then, at last, his face cleared; a grin of  satisfaction twisted his heavy mouth, and he smote the desk joyously.
    "It's a cinch it'll get 'im!" he rumbled, in glee.
    He pressed the button-call, and ordered the doorman to send in Cassidy.
  When the detective appeared a minute later, he went directly to his  subject with a straightforward energy usual to him in his work.
    "Does Garson know we've arrested the Turner girl and young Gilder?" And,  when he had been answered in the negative: "Or that we've got Chicago  Red and Dacey here?"    "No," Cassidy replied.
 "He hasn't been spoken to since we made the  collar.
.
.
.
 He seems worried," the detective volunteered.
    Burke's broad jowls shook from the force with which he snapped his jaws  together.
    "He'll be more worried before I get through with him!" he growled.
  He regarded Cassidy speculatively.
 "Do you remember the Third Degree  Inspector Burns worked on McGloin? Well," he went on, as the detective  nodded assent, "that's what I'm going to do to Garson.
 He's got  imagination, that crook! The things he don't know about are the things  he's afraid of.
 After he gets in here, I want you to take his pals one  after the other, and lock them up in the cells there in the corridor.
  The shades on the corridor windows here will be up, and Garson will see  them taken in.
 The fact of their being there will set his imagination to  working overtime, all right.
"    Burke reflected for a moment, and then issued the final directions for  the execution of his latest plot.
    "When you get the buzzer from me, you have young Gilder and the Turner  woman sent in.
 Then, after a while, you'll get another buzzer.
 When you  hear that, come right in here, and tell me that the gang has squealed.
  I'll do the rest.
 Bring Garson here in just five minutes.
.
.
.
 Tell Dan to  come in.
"    As the detective went out, the doorman promptly entered, and thereat  Burke proceeded with the further instructions necessary to the carrying  out of his scheme.
    "Take the chairs out of the office, Dan," he directed, "except mine and  one other--that one!" He indicated a chair standing a little way from  one end of his desk.
 "Now, have all the shades up.
" He chuckled as he  added: "That Turner woman saved you the trouble with one.
"    As the doorman went out after having fulfilled these commands, the  Inspector lighted the cigar which he had retained still in his mouth,  and then seated himself in the chair that was set partly facing the  windows opening on the corridor.
 He smiled with anticipatory triumph as  he made sure that the whole length of the corridor with the barred  doors of the cells was plainly visible to one sitting thus.
 With a final  glance about to make certain that all was in readiness, he returned to  his chair, and, when the door opened, he was, to all appearances, busily  engaged in writing.
    "Here's Garson, Chief," Cassidy announced.
    "Hello, Joe!" Burke exclaimed, with a seeming of careless friendliness,  as the detective went out, and Garson stood motionless just within the  door.
    "Sit down, a minute, won't you?" the Inspector continued, affably.
 He  did not look up from his writing as he spoke.
    Garson's usually strong face was showing weak with fear.
 His chin, which  was commonly very firm, moved a little from uneasy twitchings of his  lips.
 His clear eyes were slightly clouded to a look of apprehension,  as they roved the room furtively.
 He made no answer to the Inspector's  greeting for a few moments, but remained standing without movement,  poised alertly as if sensing some concealed peril.
 Finally, however,  his anxiety found expression in words.
 His tone was pregnant with alarm,  though he strove to make it merely complaining.
    "Say, what am I arrested for?" he protested.
 "I ain't done anything.
"    Even now, Burke did not look up, and his pen continued to hurry over the  paper.
    "Who told you you were arrested?" he remarked, cheerfully, in his  blandest voice.
    Garson uttered an ejaculation of disgust.
    "I don't have to be told," he retorted, huffily.
 "I'm no college  president, but, when a cop grabs me and brings me down here, I've got  sense enough to know I'm pinched.
"    The Inspector did not interrupt his work, but answered with the utmost  good nature.
    "Is that what they did to you, Joe? I'll have to speak to Cassidy about  that.
 Now, just you sit down, Joe, won't you? I want to have a little  talk with you.
 I'll be through here in a second.
" He went on with the  writing.
    Garson moved forward slightly, to the single chair near the end of the  desk, and there seated himself mechanically.
 His face thus was turned  toward the windows that gave on the corridor, and his eyes grew yet more  clouded as they rested on the grim doors of the cells.
 He writhed in his  chair, and his gaze jumped from the cells to the impassive figure of  the man at the desk.
 Now, the forger's nervousness increased momently it  swept beyond his control.
 Of a sudden, he sprang up, and stepped close  to the Inspector.
    "Say," he said, in a husky voice, "I'd like--I'd like to have a lawyer.
"    "What's the matter with you, Joe?" the Inspector returned, always with  that imperturbable air, and without raising his head from the work that  so engrossed his attention.
 "You know, you're not arrested, Joe.
 Maybe,  you never will be.
 Now, for the love of Mike, keep still, and let me  finish this letter.
"    Slowly, very hesitatingly, Garson went back to the chair, and sank  down on it in a limp attitude of dejection wholly unlike his customary  postures of strength.
 Again, his fear-fascinated eyes went to the row  of cells that stood silently menacing on the other side of the corridor  beyond the windows.
 His face was tinged with gray.
 A physical sickness  was creeping stealthily on him, as his thoughts held insistently to the  catastrophe that threatened.
 His intelligence was too keen to permit  a belief that Burke's manner of almost fulsome kindliness hid nothing  ominous--ominous with a hint of death for him in return for the death he  had wrought.
    Then, terror crystallized.
 His eyes were caught by a figure, the figure  of Cassidy, advancing there in the corridor.
 And with the detective  went a man whose gait was slinking, craven.
 A cell-door swung open, the  prisoner stepped within, the door clanged to, the bolts shot into their  sockets noisily.
    Garson sat huddled, stricken--for he had recognized the victim thrust  into the cell before his eyes.
.
.
.
 It was Dacey, one of his own cronies  in crime--Dacey, who, the night before, had seen him kill Eddie Griggs.
  There was something concretely sinister to Garson in this fact of  Dacey's presence there in the cell.
    Of a sudden, the forger cried out raucously:    "Say, Inspector, if you've got anything on me, I--I would----" The cry  dropped into unintelligible mumblings.
    Burke retained his manner of serene indifference to the other's  agitation.
 Still, his pen hurried over the paper; and he did not trouble  to look up as he expostulated, half-banteringly.
    "Now, now! What's the matter with you, Joe? I told you that I wanted to  ask you a few questions.
 That's all.
"    Garson leaped to his feet again resolutely, then faltered, and  ultimately fell back into the chair with a groan, as the Inspector went  on speaking.
    "Now, Joe, sit down, and keep still, I tell you, and let me get through  with this job.
 It won't take me more than a minute more.
"    But, after a moment, Garson's emotion forced hint to another appeal.
    "Say, Inspector----" he began.
    Then, abruptly, he was silent, his mouth still open to utter the words  that were now held back by horror.
 Again, he saw the detective walking  forward, out there in the corridor.
 And with him, as before, was a  second figure, which advanced slinkingly.
 Garson leaned forward in his  chair, his head thrust out, watching in rigid suspense.
 Again, even  as before, the door swung wide, the prisoner slipped within, the door  clanged shut, the bolts clattered noisily into their sockets.
    And, in the watcher, terror grew--for he had seen the face of Chicago  Red, another of his pals, another who had seen him kill Griggs.
 For a  time that seemed to him long ages of misery, Garson sat staring dazedly  at the closed doors of the tier of cells.
 The peril about him was  growing--growing, and it was a deadly peril! At last, he licked his dry  lips, and his voice broke in a throaty whisper.
    "Say, Inspector, if you've got anything against me, why----"    "Who said there was anything against you, Joe?" Burke rejoined, in a  voice that was genially chiding.
 "What's the matter with you to-day,  Joe? You seem nervous.
" Still, the official kept on with his writing.
    "No, I ain't nervous," Garson cried, with a feverish effort to appear  calm.
 "Why, what makes you think that? But this ain't exactly the place  you'd pick out as a pleasant one to spend the morning.
" He was silent  for a little, trying with all his strength to regain his self-control,  but with small success.
    "Could I ask you a question?" he demanded finally, with more firmness in  his voice.
    "What is it?" Burke said.
    Garson cleared his throat with difficulty, and his voice was thick.
    "I was just going to say--" he began.
 Then, he hesitated, and was  silent, at a loss.
    "Well, what is it, Joe?" the Inspector prompted.
    "I was going to say--that is--well, if it's anything about Mary Turner,  I don't know a thing--not a thing!"    It was the thought of possible peril to her that now, in an instant, had  caused him to forget his own mortal danger.
 Where, before, he had been  shuddering over thoughts of the death-house cell that might be awaiting  him, he now had concern only for the safety of the woman he cherished.
  And there was a great grief in his soul; for it was borne in on him that  his own folly, in disobedience to her command, had led up to the murder  of Griggs--and to all that might come of the crime.
 How could he ever  make amends to her? At least, he could be brave here, for her sake, if  not for his own.
    Burke believed that his opportunity was come.
    "What made you think I wanted to know anything about her?" he  questioned.
    "Oh, I can't exactly say," Garson replied carelessly, in an attempt to  dissimulate his agitation.
 "You were up to the house, you know.
 Don't  you see?"    "I did want to see her, that's a fact," Burke admitted.
 He kept on with  his writing, his head bent low.
 "But she wasn't at her flat.
 I guess she  must have taken my advice, and skipped out.
 Clever girl, that!"    Garson contrived to present an aspect of comparative indifference.
    "Yes," he agreed.
 "I was thinking of going West, myself," he ventured.
    "Oh, were you?" Burke exclaimed; and, now, there was a new note in  his voice.
 His hand slipped into the pocket where was the pistol, and  clutched it.
 He stared at Garson fiercely, and spoke with a rush of the  words:    "Why did you kill Eddie Griggs?"    "I didn't kill him!" The reply was quick enough, but it came weakly.
  Again, Garson was forced to wet his lips with a dry tongue, and to  swallow painfully.
 "I tell you, I didn't kill him!" he repeated at last,  with more force.
    Burke sneered his disbelief.
    "You killed him last night--with this!" he cried, viciously.
 On the  instant, the pistol leaped into view, pointed straight at Garson.
 "Why?"  the Inspector shouted.
 "Come on, now! Why?"    "I didn't, I tell you!" Garson was growing stronger, since at last  the crisis was upon him.
 He got to his feet with lithe swiftness  of movement, and sprang close to the desk.
 He bent his head forward  challengingly, to meet the glare of his accuser's eyes.
 There was no  flinching in his own steely stare.
 His nerves had ceased their jangling  under the tautening of necessity.
    "You did!" Burke vociferated.
 He put his whole will into the assertion  of guilt, to batter down the man's resistance.
 "You did, I tell you! You  did!"    Garson leaned still further forward, until his face was almost level  with the Inspector's.
 His eyes were unclouded now, were blazing.
 His  voice came resonant in its denial.
 The entire pose of him was intrepid,  dauntless.
    "And I tell you, I didn't!"    There passed many seconds, while the two men battled in silence, will  warring against will.
.
.
.
 In the end, it was the murderer who triumphed.
    Suddenly, Burke dropped the pistol into his pocket, and lolled back in  his chair.
 His gaze fell away from the man confronting him.
 In the same  instant, the rigidity of Garson's form relaxed, and he straightened  slowly.
 A tide of secret joy swept through him, as he realized his  victory.
 But his outward expression remained unchanged.
    "Oh, well," Burke exclaimed amiably, "I didn't really think you did,  but I wasn't sure, so I had to take a chance.
 You understand, don't you,  Joe?"    "Sure, I understand," Garson replied, with an amiability equal to the  Inspector's own.
    Burke's manner continued very amicable as he went on speaking.
    "You see, Joe, anyhow, we've got the right party safe enough.
 You can  bet on that!"    Garson resisted the lure.
    "If you don't want me----" he began suggestively; and he turned toward  the door to the outer hall.
 "Why, if you don't want me, I'll--get  along.
"    "Oh, what's the hurry, Joe?" Burke retorted, with the effect of stopping  the other short.
 He pressed the buzzer as the agreed signal to Cassidy.
  "Where did you say Mary Turner was last night?"    At the question, all Garson's fears for the woman rushed back on him  with appalling force.
 Of what avail his safety, if she were still in  peril?    "I don't know where she was," he exclaimed, doubtfully.
 He realized his  blunder even as the words left his lips, and sought to correct it as  best he might.
 "Why, yes, I do, too," he went on, as if assailed by  sudden memory.
 "I dropped into her place kind of late, and they said  she'd gone to bed--headache, I guess.
.
.
.
 Yes, she was home, of course.
  She didn't go out of the house, all night.
" His insistence on the point  was of itself suspicious, but eagerness to protect her stultified his  wits.
    Burke sat grim and silent, offering no comment on the lie.
    "Know anything about young Gilder?" he demanded.
 "Happen to know where  he is now?" He arose and came around the desk, so that he stood close to  Garson, at whom he glowered.
    "Not a thing!" was the earnest answer.
 But the speaker's fear rose  swiftly, for the linking of these names was significant--frightfully  significant!    The inner door opened, and Mary Turner entered the office.
 Garson with  difficulty suppressed the cry of distress that rose to his lips.
 For  a few moments, the silence was unbroken.
 Then, presently, Burke, by a  gesture, directed the girl to advance toward the center of the room.
  As she obeyed, he himself went a little toward the door, and, when it  opened again, and Dick Gilder appeared, he interposed to check the young  man's rush forward as his gaze fell on his bride, who stood regarding  him with sad eyes.
    Garson stared mutely at the burly man in uniform who held their  destinies in the hollow of a hand.
 His lips parted as if he were about  to speak.
 Then, he bade defiance to the impulse.
 He deemed it safer for  all that he should say nothing--now!.
.
.
 And it is very easy to say  a word too many.
 And that one may be a word never to be unsaid--or  gainsaid.
    Then, while still that curious, dynamic silence endured, Cassidy came  briskly into the office.
 By some magic of duty, he had contrived to give  his usually hebetudinous features an expression of enthusiasm.
    "Say, Chief," the detective said rapidly, "they've squealed!"    Burke regarded his aide with an air intolerably triumphant.
 His voice  came smug:    "Squealed, eh?" His glance ran over Garson for a second, then made  its inquisition of Mary and of Dick Gilder.
 He did not give a look to  Cassidy as he put his question.
 "Do they tell the same story?" And then,  when the detective had answered in the affirmative, he went on speaking  in tones ponderous with self-complacency; and, now, his eyes held  sharply, craftily, on the woman.
    "I was right then, after all--right, all the time! Good enough!" Of  a sudden, his voice boomed somberly.
 "Mary Turner, I want you for the  murder of----"    Garson's rush halted the sentence.
 He had leaped forward.
 His face was  rigid.
 He broke on the Inspector's words with a gesture of fury.
 His  voice came in a hiss:    "That's a damned lie!.
.
.
 I did it!"        .
 ANGUISH AND BLISS.
    Joe Garson had shouted his confession without a second of reflection.
  But the result must have been the same had he taken years of thought.
  Between him and her as the victim of the law, there could be no  hesitation for choice.
 Indeed, just now, he had no heed to his own fate.
  The prime necessity was to save her, Mary, from the toils of the law  that were closing around her.
 For himself, in the days to come, there  would be a ghastly dread, but there would never be regret over the  cost of saving her.
 Perhaps, some other he might have let suffer in his  stead--not her! Even, had he been innocent, and she guilty of the crime,  he would still have taken the burden of it on his own shoulders.
 He had  saved her from the waters--he would save her until the end, as far  as the power in him might lie.
 It was thus that, with the primitive  directness of his reverential love for the girl, he counted no sacrifice  too great in her behalf.
 Joe Garson was not a good man, at the world  esteems goodness.
 On the contrary, he was distinctly an evil one,  a menace to the society on which he preyed constantly.
 But his good  qualities, if few, were of the strongest fiber, rooted in the deeps of  him.
 He loathed treachery.
 His one guiltiness in this respect had been,  curiously enough, toward Mary herself, in the scheme of the burglary,  which she had forbidden.
 But, in the last analysis, here his deceit  had been designed to bring affluence to her.
 It was his abhorrence  of treachery among pals that had driven him to the murder of the  stool-pigeon in a fit of ungovernable passion.
 He might have stayed his  hand then, but for the gusty rage that swept him on to the crime.
 None  the less, had he spared the man, his hatred of the betrayer would have  been the same.
.
.
.
 And the other virtue of Joe Garson was the complement  of this--his own loyalty, a loyalty that made him forget self utterly  where he loved.
 The one woman who had ever filled his heart was Mary,  and for her his life were not too much to give.
    The suddenness of it all held Mary voiceless for long seconds.
 She was  frozen with horror of the event.
    When, at last, words came, they were a frantic prayer of protest.
    "No, Joe! No! Don't talk--don't talk!"    Burke, immensely gratified, went nimbly to his chair, and thence  surveyed the agitated group with grisly pleasure.
    "Joe has talked," he said, significantly.
    Mary, shaken as she was by the fact of Garson's confession, nevertheless  retained her presence of mind sufficiently to resist with all her  strength.
    "He did it to protect me," she stated, earnestly.
    The Inspector disdained such futile argument.
 As the doorman appeared in  answer to the buzzer, he directed that the stenographer be summoned at  once.
    "We'll have the confession in due form," he remarked, gazing pleasedly  on the three before him.
    "He's not going to confess," Mary insisted, with spirit.
    But Burke was not in the least impressed.
 He disregarded her completely,  and spoke mechanically to Garson the formal warning required by the law.
    "You are hereby cautioned that anything you say may be used against  you.
" Then, as the stenographer entered, he went on with lively  interest.
 "Now, Joe!"    Yet once again, Mary protested, a little wildly.
    "Don't speak, Joe! Don't say a word till we can get a lawyer for you!"    The man met her pleading eyes steadily, and shook his head in refusal.
    "It's no use, my girl," Burke broke in, harshly.
 "I told you I'd  get you.
 I'm going to try you and Garson, and the whole gang for  murder--yes, every one of you.
.
.
.
 And you, Gilder," he continued,  lowering on the young man who had defied him so obstinately, "you'll go  to the House of Detention as a material witness.
" He turned his gaze to  Garson again, and spoke authoritatively: "Come on now, Joe!"    Garson went a step toward the desk, and spoke decisively.
    "If I come through, you'll let her go--and him?" he added as an  afterthought, with a nod toward Dick Gilder.
    "Oh, Joe, don't!" Mary cried, bitterly.
 "We'll spend every dollar we can  raise to save you!"    "Now, it's no use," the Inspector complained.
 "You're only wasting time.
  He's said that he did it.
 That's all there is to it.
 Now that we're sure  he's our man, he hasn't got a chance in the world.
"    "Well, how about it?" Garson demanded, savagely.
 "Do they go clear, if I  come through?"    "We'll get the best lawyers in the country," Mary persisted,  desperately.
 "We'll save you, Joe--we'll save you!"    Garson regarded the distraught girl with wistful eyes.
 But there was  no trace of yielding in his voice as he replied, though he spoke very  sorrowfully.
    "No, you can't help me," he said, simply.
 "My time has come, Mary.
.
.
.
  And I can save you a lot of trouble.
"    "He's right there," Burke ejaculated.
 "We've got him cold.
 So, what's  the use of dragging you two into it?"    "Then, they go clear?" Garson exclaimed, eagerly.
 "They ain't even to be  called as witnesses?"    Burke nodded assent.
    "You're on!" he agreed.
    "Then, here goes!" Garson cried; and he looked expectantly toward the  stenographer.
    The strain of it all was sapping the will of the girl, who saw the man  she so greatly esteemed for his service to her and his devotion about  to condemn himself to death.
 She grew half-hysterical.
 Her words came  confusedly:    "No, Joe! No, no, no!"    Again, Garson shook his head in absolute refusal of her plea.
    "There's no other way out," he declared, wearily.
 "I'm going  through with it.
" He straightened a little, and again looked at the  stenographer.
 His voice came quietly, without any tremulousnesss.
    "My name is Joe Garson.
"    "Alias?" Burke suggested.
    "Alias nothing!" came the sharp retort.
 "Garson's my monaker.
 I shot  English Eddie, because he was a skunk, and a stool-pigeon, and he got  just what was coming to him.
" Vituperation beyond the mere words beat in  his voice now.
    Burke twisted uneasily in his chair.
    "Now, now!" he objected, severely.
 "We can't take a confession like  that.
"    Garson shook his head--spoke with fiercer hatred, "because he was a  skunk, and a stool-pigeon," he repeated.
 "Have you got it?" And then, as  the stenographer nodded assent, he went on, less violently: "I croaked  him just as he was going to call the bulls with a police-whistle.
 I used  a gun with smokeless powder.
 It had a Maxim silencer on it, so that it  didn't make any noise.
"    Garson paused, and the set despair of his features lightened a little.
  Into his voice came a tone of exultation indescribably ghastly.
 It  was born of the eternal egotism of the criminal, fattening vanity in  gloating over his ingenuity for evil.
 Garson, despite his two great  virtues, had the vices of his class.
 Now, he stared at Burke with a  quizzical grin crooking his lips.
    "Say," he exclaimed, "I'll bet it's the first time a guy was ever  croaked with one of them things! Ain't it?"    The Inspector nodded affirmation.
 There was sincere admiration in  his expression, for he was ready at all times to respect the personal  abilities of the criminals against whom he waged relentless war.
    "That's right, Joe!" he said, with perceptible enthusiasm.
    "Some class to that, eh?" Garson demanded, still with that gruesome air  of boasting.
 "I got the gun, and the Maxim-silencer thing, off a fence  in Boston," he explained.
 "Say, that thing cost me sixty dollars, and  it's worth every cent of the money.
.
.
.
 Why, they'll remember me as the  first to spring one of them things, won't they?"    "They sure will, Joe!" the Inspector conceded.
    "Nobody knew I had it," Garson continued, dropping his braggart manner  abruptly.
    At the words, Mary started, and her lips moved as if she were about to  speak.
    Garson, intent on her always, though he seemed to look only at Burke,  observed the effect on her, and repeated his words swiftly, with a  warning emphasis that gave the girl pause.
    "Nobody knew I had it--nobody in the world!" he declared.
 "And nobody  had anything to do with the killing but me.
"    Burke put a question that was troubling him much, concerning the motive  that lay behind the shooting of Griggs.
    "Was there any bad feeling between you and Eddie Griggs?"    Garson's reply was explicit.
    "Never till that very minute.
 Then, I learned the truth about what  he'd framed up with you.
" The speaker's voice reverted to its former  fierceness in recollection of the treachery of one whom he had trusted.
    "He was a stool-pigeon, and I hated his guts! That's all," he concluded,  with brutal candor.
    The Inspector moved restlessly in his chair.
 He had only detestation  for the slain man, yet there was something morbidly distasteful in the  thought that he himself had contrived the situation which had resulted  in the murder of his confederate.
 It was only by an effort that he shook  off the vague feeling of guilt.
    "Nothing else to say?" he inquired.
    Garson reflected for a few seconds, then made a gesture of negation.
    "Nothing else," he declared.
 "I croaked him, and I'm glad I done it.
 He  was a skunk.
 That's all, and it's enough.
 And it's all true, so help me  God!"    The Inspector nodded dismissal to the stenographer, with an air of  relief.
    "That's all, Williams," he said, heavily.
 "He'll sign it as soon as  you've transcribed the notes.
"    Then, as the stenographer left the room, Burke turned his gaze on the  woman, who stood there in a posture of complete dejection, her white,  anguished face downcast.
 There was triumph in the Inspector's voice  as he addressed her, for his professional pride was full-fed by this  victory over his foes.
 But there was, too, an undertone of a feeling  softer than pride, more generous, something akin to real commiseration  for this unhappy girl who drooped before him, suffering so poignantly  in the knowledge of the fate that awaited the man who had saved her, who  had loved her so unselfishly.
    "Young woman," Burke said briskly, "it's just like I told you.
 You can't  beat the law.
 Garson thought he could--and now----!" He broke off, with  a wave of his hand toward the man who had just sentenced himself to  death in the electric-chair.
    "That's right," Garson agreed, with somber intensity.
 His eyes were  grown clouded again now, and his voice dragged leaden.
 "That's right,  Mary," he repeated dully, after a little pause.
 "You can't beat the  law!"    There followed a period of silence, in which great emotions were vibrant  from heart to heart.
 Garson was thinking of Mary, and, with the thought,  into his misery crept a little comfort.
 At least, she would go free.
  That had been in the bargain with Burke.
 And there was the boy, too.
 His  eyes shot a single swift glance toward Dick Gilder, and his satisfaction  increased as he noted the alert poise of the young man's body, the  strained expression of the strong face, the gaze of absorbed yearning  with which he regarded Mary.
 There could be no doubt concerning the  depth of the lad's love for the girl.
 Moreover, there were manly  qualities in him to work out all things needful for her protection  through life.
 Already, he had proved his devotion, and that abundantly,  his unswerving fidelity to her, and the force within him that made these  worthy in some measure of her.
    Garson felt no least pang of jealousy.
 Though he loved the woman with  the single love of his life, he had never, somehow, hoped aught for  himself.
 There was even something almost of the paternal in the purity  of his love, as if, indeed, by the fact of restoring her to life he had  taken on himself the responsibility of a parent.
 He knew that the boy  worshiped her, would do his best for her, that this best would suffice  for her happiness in time.
 Garson, with the instinct of love, guessed  that Mary had in truth given her heart all unaware to the husband whom  she had first lured only for the lust of revenge.
 Garson nodded his  head in a melancholy satisfaction.
 His life was done: hers was just  beginning, now.
.
.
.
 But she would remember him--oh, yes, always! Mary was  loyal.
    The man checked the trend of his thoughts by a mighty effort of will.
  He must not grow maudlin here.
 He spoke again to Mary, with a certain  dignity.
    "No, you can't beat the law!" He hesitated a little, then went on, with  a certain curious embarrassment.
 "And this same old law says a woman  must stick to her man.
"    The girl's eyes met his with passionate sorrow in their misty deeps.
  Garson gave a significant glance toward Dick Gilder, then his gaze  returned to her.
 There was a smoldering despair in that look.
 There  were, as well, an entreaty and a command.
    "So," he went on, "you must go along with him, Mary.
.
.
.
 Won't you? It's  the best thing to do.
"    The girl could not answer.
 There was a clutch on her throat just then,  which would not relax at the call of her will.
    The tension of a moment grew, became pervasive.
 Burke, accustomed as  he was to scenes of dramatic violence, now experienced an altogether  unfamiliar thrill.
 As for Garson, once again the surge of feeling  threatened to overwhelm his self-control.
 He must not break down! For  Mary's sake, he must show himself stoical, quite undisturbed in this  supreme hour.
    Of a sudden, an inspiration came to him, a means to snap the tension,  to create a diversion wholly efficacious.
 He would turn to his boasting  again, would call upon his vanity, which he knew well as his chief  foible, and make it serve as the foil against his love.
 He strove  manfully to throw off the softer mood.
 In a measure, at least, he  won the fight--though always, under the rush of this vaunting, there  throbbed the anguish of his heart.
    "You want to cut out worrying about me," he counseled, bravely.
 "Why,  I ain't worrying any, myself--not a little bit! You see, it's something  new I've pulled off.
 Nobody ever put over anything like it before.
"    He faced Burke with a grin of gloating again.
    "I'll bet there'll be a lot of stuff in the newspapers about this, and  my picture, too, in most of 'em! What?"    The man's manner imposed on Burke, though Mary felt the torment that his  vainglorying was meant to mask.
    "Say," Garson continued to the Inspector, "if the reporters want any  pictures of me, could I have some new ones taken? The one you've got of  me in the Gallery is over ten years old.
 I've taken off my beard since  then.
 Can I have a new one?" He put the question with an eagerness that  seemed all sincere.
    Burke answered with a fine feeling of generosity.
    "Sure, you can, Joe! I'll send you up to the Gallery right now.
"    "Immense!" Garson cried, boisterously.
 He moved toward Dick Gilder,  walking with a faint suggestion of swagger to cover the nervous tremor  that had seized him.
    "So long, young fellow!" he exclaimed, and held out his hand.
 "You've  been on the square, and I guess you always will be.
"    Dick had no scruple in clasping that extended hand very warmly in his  own.
 He had no feeling of repulsion against this man who had committed  a murder in his presence.
 Though he did not quite understand the other's  heart, his instinct as a lover taught him much, so that he pitied  profoundly--and respected, too.
    "We'll do what we can for you," he said, simply.
    "That's all right," Garson replied, with such carelessness of manner as  he could contrive.
 Then, at last, he turned to Mary.
 This parting must  be bitter, and he braced himself with all the vigors of his will to  combat the weakness that leaped from his soul.
    As he came near, the girl could hold herself in leash no longer.
 She  threw herself on his breast.
 Her arms wreathed about his neck.
 Great  sobs racked her.
    "Oh, Joe, Joe!" The gasping cry was of utter despair.
    Garson's trembling hand patted the girl's shoulder very softly, a caress  of infinite tenderness.
    "That's all right!" he murmured, huskily.
 "That's all right, Mary!"  There was a short silence; and then he went on speaking, more firmly.
  "You know, he'll look after you.
"    He would have said more, but he could not.
 It seemed to him that the  sobs of the girl caught in his own throat.
 Yet, presently, he strove  once again, with every reserve of his strength; and, finally, he so far  mastered himself that he could speak calmly.
 The words were uttered with  a subtle renunciation that was this man's religion.
    "Yes, he'll take care of you.
 Why, I'd like to see the two of you with  about three kiddies playing round the house.
"    He looked up over the girl's shoulder, and beckoned with his head to  Dick, who came forward at the summons.
    "Take good care of her, won't you?"    He disengaged himself gently from the girl's embrace, and set her within  the arms of her husband, where she rested quietly, as if unable to fight  longer against fate's decree.
    "Well, so long!"    He dared not utter another word, but turned blindly, and went, stumbling  a little, toward the doorman, who had appeared in answer to the  Inspector's call.
    "To the Gallery," Burke ordered, curtly.
    Garson went on without ever a glance back.
.
.
.
 His strength was at an  end.
             There was a long silence in the room after Garson's passing.
 It was  broken, at last, by the Inspector, who got up from his chair, and  advanced toward the husband and wife.
 In his hand, he carried a sheet of  paper, roughly scrawled.
 As he stopped before the two, and cleared  his throat, Mary withdrew herself from Dick's arms, and regarded the  official with brooding eyes from out her white face.
 Something strange  in her enemy's expression caught her attention, something that set new  hopes alive within her in a fashion wholly inexplicable, so that she  waited with a sudden, breathless eagerness.
    Burke extended the sheet of paper to the husband.
    "There's a document," he said gruffly.
 "It's a letter from one Helen  Morris, in which she sets forth the interesting fact that she pulled off  a theft in the Emporium, for which your Mrs. Gilder here did time.
 You  know, your father got your Mrs. Gilder sent up for three years for that  same job--which she didn't do! That's why she had such a grudge against  your father, and against the law, too!"    Burke chuckled, as the young man took the paper, wonderingly.
    "I don't know that I blame her much for that grudge, when all's said and  done.
.
.
.
 You give that document to your father.
 It sets her right.
 He's  a just man according to his lights, your father.
 He'll do all he can to  make things right for her, now he knows.
"    Once again, the Inspector paused to chuckle.
    "I guess she'll keep within the law from now on," he continued,  contentedly, "without getting a lawyer to tell her how.
.
.
.
 Now, you two  listen.
 I've got to go out a minute.
 When I get back, I don't want to  find anybody here--not anybody! Do you get me?"    He strode from the room, fearful lest further delay might involve him  in sentimental thanksgivings from one or the other, or both--and Burke  hated sentiment as something distinctly unprofessional.
             When the official was gone, the two stood staring mutely each at the  other through long seconds.
 What she read in the man's eyes set the  woman's heart to beating with a new delight.
 A bloom of exquisite rose  grew in the pallor of her cheeks.
 The misty light in the violet eyes  shone more radiant, yet more softly.
 The crimson lips curved to strange  tenderness.
.
.
.
 What he read in her eyes set the husband's pulses to  bounding.
 He opened his arms in an appeal that was a command.
 Mary went  forward slowly, without hesitation, in a bliss that forgot every sorrow  for that blessed moment, and cast herself on his breast.

                   [Picture: Woman opening window and seeing bird]    HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy  Prince.
  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes  he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his  sword-hilt.
    He was very much admired indeed.
  He is as beautiful as a weathercock,  remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for  having artistic tastes; only not quite so useful, he added, fearing  lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.
    Why cant you be like the Happy Prince? asked a sensible mother of her  little boy who was crying for the moon.
  The Happy Prince never dreams  of crying for anything.
    I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy, muttered a  disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.
    He looks just like an angel, said the Charity Children as they came out  of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white  pinafores.
    How do you know? said the Mathematical Master, you have never seen  one.
    Ah! but we have, in our dreams, answered the children; and the  Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not  approve of children dreaming.
    One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.
  His friends had  gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was  in love with the most beautiful Reed.
  He had met her early in the spring  as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so  attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.
    Shall I love you? said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at  once, and the Reed made him a low bow.
  So he flew round and round her,  touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.
  This was  his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.
    It is a ridiculous attachment, twittered the other Swallows; she has  no money, and far too many relations; and indeed the river was quite  full of Reeds.
  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.
    After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.
  She has no conversation, he said, and I am afraid that she is a  coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.
  And certainly,  whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.
  I  admit that she is domestic, he continued, but I love travelling, and my  wife, consequently, should love travelling also.
    Will you come away with me? he said finally to her; but the Reed shook  her head, she was so attached to her home.
    You have been trifling with me, he cried.
  I am off to the Pyramids.
  Good-bye! and he flew away.
    All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.
  Where  shall I put up? he said; I hope the town has made preparations.
    Then he saw the statue on the tall column.
    I will put up there, he cried; it is a fine position, with plenty of  fresh air.
  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.
    I have a golden bedroom, he said softly to himself as he looked round,  and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under  his wing a large drop of water fell on him.
  What a curious thing! he  cried; there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear  and bright, and yet it is raining.
  The climate in the north of Europe is  really dreadful.
  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her  selfishness.
    Then another drop fell.
    What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off? he said; I  must look for a good chimney-pot, and he determined to fly away.
    But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,  and sawAh! what did he see?    The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were  running down his golden cheeks.
  His face was so beautiful in the  moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.
    Who are you? he said.
    I am the Happy Prince.
    Why are you weeping then? asked the Swallow; you have quite drenched  me.
    When I was alive and had a human heart, answered the statue, I did not  know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where  sorrow is not allowed to enter.
  In the daytime I played with my  companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great  Hall.
  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask  what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.
  My courtiers  called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be  happiness.
  So I lived, and so I died.
  And now that I am dead they have  set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery  of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but  weep.
    What! is he not solid gold? said the Swallow to himself.
  He was too  polite to make any personal remarks out loud.
    Far away, continued the statue in a low musical voice, far away in a  little street there is a poor house.
  One of the windows is open, and  through it I can see a woman seated at a table.
  Her face is thin and  worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she  is a seamstress.
  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for  the loveliest of the Queens maids-of-honour to wear at the next  Court-ball.
  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying  ill.
  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.
  His mother has nothing  to give him but river water, so he is crying.
  Swallow, Swallow, little  Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet  are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.
    I am waited for in Egypt, said the Swallow.
  My friends are flying up  and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.
  Soon they  will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.
  The King is there  himself in his painted coffin.
  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and  embalmed with spices.
  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and  his hands are like withered leaves.
    Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay  with me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and  the mother so sad.
    I dont think I like boys, answered the Swallow.
  Last summer, when I  was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the millers sons,  who were always throwing stones at me.
  They never hit me, of course; we  swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family  famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.
    But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.
  It is very cold here, he said; but I will stay with you for one night,  and be your messenger.
    Thank you, little Swallow, said the Prince.
    So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Princes sword, and  flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.
    He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were  sculptured.
  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.
  A  beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.
  How wonderful  the stars are, he said to her, and how wonderful is the power of love!    I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball, she answered;  I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the  seamstresses are so lazy.
    He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of  the ships.
  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining  with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.
  At last he  came to the poor house and looked in.
  The boy was tossing feverishly on  his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.
  In he  hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the womans thimble.
  Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boys forehead with his  wings.
  How cool I feel, said the boy, I must be getting better; and  he sank into a delicious slumber.
    Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had  done.
  It is curious, he remarked, but I feel quite warm now, although  it is so cold.
    That is because you have done a good action, said the Prince.
  And the  little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.
  Thinking always  made him sleepy.
    When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.
  What a  remarkable phenomenon, said the Professor of Ornithology as he was  passing over the bridge.
  A swallow in winter!  And he wrote a long  letter about it to the local newspaper.
  Every one quoted it, it was full  of so many words that they could not understand.
    To-night I go to Egypt, said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at  the prospect.
  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time  on top of the church steeple.
  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,  and said to each other, What a distinguished stranger! so he enjoyed  himself very much.
    When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.
  Have you any  commissions for Egypt? he cried; I am just starting.
    Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay  with me one night longer?    I am waited for in Egypt, answered the Swallow.
  To-morrow my friends  will fly up to the Second Cataract.
  The river-horse couches there among  the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.
  All  night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he  utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.
  At noon the yellow lions  come down to the waters edge to drink.
  They have eyes like green  beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.
    Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, far away across the  city I see a young man in a garret.
  He is leaning over a desk covered  with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered  violets.
  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a  pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.
  He is trying to finish a  play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any  more.
  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.
    I will wait with you one night longer, said the Swallow, who really had  a good heart.
  Shall I take him another ruby?    Alas!  I have no ruby now, said the Prince; my eyes are all that I  have left.
  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of  India a thousand years ago.
  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.
  He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish  his play.
    Dear Prince, said the Swallow, I cannot do that; and he began to  weep.
    Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, do as I command  you.
    So the Swallow plucked out the Princes eye, and flew away to the  students garret.
  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in  the roof.
  Through this he darted, and came into the room.
  The young man  had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the  birds wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying  on the withered violets.
    I am beginning to be appreciated, he cried; this is from some great  admirer.
  Now I can finish my play, and he looked quite happy.
    The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.
  He sat on the mast of  a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold  with ropes.
  Heave a-hoy! they shouted as each chest came up.
  I am  going to Egypt! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon  rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.
    I am come to bid you good-bye, he cried.
    Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay  with me one night longer?    It is winter, answered the Swallow, and the chill snow will soon be  here.
  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the  crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.
  My companions are  building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves  are watching them, and cooing to each other.
  Dear Prince, I must leave  you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back  two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.
  The ruby  shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the  great sea.
    In the square below, said the Happy Prince, there stands a little  match-girl.
  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all  spoiled.
  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,  and she is crying.
  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is  bare.
  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will  not beat her.
    I will stay with you one night longer, said the Swallow, but I cannot  pluck out your eye.
  You would be quite blind then.
    Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, do as I command  you.
    So he plucked out the Princes other eye, and darted down with it.
  He  swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her  hand.
  What a lovely bit of glass, cried the little girl; and she ran  home, laughing.
    Then the Swallow came back to the Prince.
  You are blind now, he said,  so I will stay with you always.
    No, little Swallow, said the poor Prince, you must go away to Egypt.
    I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the  Princes feet.
    All the next day he sat on the Princes shoulder, and told him stories of  what he had seen in strange lands.
  He told him of the red ibises, who  stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their  beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the  desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the  side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King  of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a  large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and  has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who  sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the  butterflies.
    Dear little Swallow, said the Prince, you tell me of marvellous  things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of  women.
  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.
  Fly over my city, little  Swallow, and tell me what you see there.
    So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in  their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.
  He  flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children  looking out listlessly at the black streets.
  Under the archway of a  bridge two little boys were lying in one anothers arms to try and keep  themselves warm.
  How hungry we are! they said.
  You must not lie  here, shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.
    Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.
    I am covered with fine gold, said the Prince, you must take it off,  leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold  can make them happy.
    Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy  Prince looked quite dull and grey.
  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he  brought to the poor, and the childrens faces grew rosier, and they  laughed and played games in the street.
  We have bread now! they cried.
    Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.
  The streets  looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and  glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of  the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore  scarlet caps and skated on the ice.
    The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave  the Prince, he loved him too well.
  He picked up crumbs outside the  bakers door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself  warm by flapping his wings.
    But at last he knew that he was going to die.
  He had just strength to  fly up to the Princes shoulder once more.
  Good-bye, dear Prince! he  murmured, will you let me kiss your hand?    I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow, said the  Prince, you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,  for I love you.
    It is not to Egypt that I am going, said the Swallow.
  I am going to  the House of Death.
  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?    And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his  feet.
    At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something  had broken.
  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.
  It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.
    Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in  company with the Town Councillors.
  As they passed the column he looked  up at the statue: Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks! he said.
    How shabby indeed! cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with  the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.
    The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is  golden no longer, said the Mayor in fact, he is litttle better than a  beggar!    Little better than a beggar, said the Town Councillors.
    And here is actually a dead bird at his feet! continued the Mayor.
  We  must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die  here.
  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.
    So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.
  As he is no longer  beautiful he is no longer useful, said the Art Professor at the  University.
    Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of  the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.
  We must  have another statue, of course, he said, and it shall be a statue of  myself.
    Of myself, said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.
  When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.
    What a strange thing! said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.
  This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.
  We must throw it  away.
  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also  lying.
    Bring me the two most precious things in the city, said God to one of  His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.
    You have rightly chosen, said God, for in my garden of Paradise this  little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy  Prince shall praise me.
                    [Picture: Decorative graphic of two birds]          The Nightingale and the Rose.
              [Picture: Decorative graphic of young man lying on grass]    SHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses, cried  the young Student; but in all my garden there is no red rose.
    From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she  looked out through the leaves, and wondered.
    No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled  with tears.
  Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!  I have  read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of  philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made  wretched.
    Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale.
  Night after night  have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told  his story to the stars, and now I see him.
  His hair is dark as the  hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but  passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal  upon his brow.
    The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night, murmured the young Student,  and my love will be of the company.
  If I bring her a red rose she will  dance with me till dawn.
  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in  my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will  be clasped in mine.
  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall  sit lonely, and she will pass me by.
  She will have no heed of me, and my  heart will break.
    Here indeed is the true lover, said the Nightingale.
  What I sing of,  he sufferswhat is joy to me, to him is pain.
  Surely Love is a wonderful  thing.
  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.
  Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the  marketplace.
  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be  weighed out in the balance for gold.
    The musicians will sit in their gallery, said the young Student, and  play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound  of the harp and the violin.
  She will dance so lightly that her feet will  not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng  round her.
  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to  give her; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in  his hands, and wept.
    Why is he weeping? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with  his tail in the air.
    Why, indeed? said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a  sunbeam.
    Why, indeed? whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.
    He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale.
    For a red rose? they cried; how very ridiculous! and the little  Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.
    But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Students sorrow, and  she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.
    Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.
  She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed  across the garden.
    In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and  when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.
    Give me a red rose, she cried, and I will sing you my sweetest song.
    But the Tree shook its head.
    My roses are white, it answered; as white as the foam of the sea, and  whiter than the snow upon the mountain.
  But go to my brother who grows  round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.
    So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the  old sun-dial.
    Give me a red rose, she cried, and I will sing you my sweetest song.
    But the Tree shook its head.
    My roses are yellow, it answered; as yellow as the hair of the  mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil  that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.
  But go  to my brother who grows beneath the Students window, and perhaps he will  give you what you want.
    So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath  the Students window.
    Give me a red rose, she cried, and I will sing you my sweetest song.
    But the Tree shook its head.
    My roses are red, it answered, as red as the feet of the dove, and  redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the  ocean-cavern.
  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has  nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no  roses at all this year.
    One red rose is all I want, cried the Nightingale, only one red rose!  Is there no way by which I can get it?    There is a way, answered the Tree; but it is so terrible that I dare  not tell it to you.
    Tell it to me, said the Nightingale, I am not afraid.
    If you want a red rose, said the Tree, you must build it out of music  by moonlight, and stain it with your own hearts-blood.
  You must sing to  me with your breast against a thorn.
  All night long you must sing to me,  and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into  my veins, and become mine.
    Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale,  and Life is very dear to all.
  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood,  and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot  of pearl.
  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the  bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the  hill.
  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird  compared to the heart of a man?    So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.
  She  swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through  the grove.
    The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him,  and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.
    Be happy, cried the Nightingale, be happy; you shall have your red  rose.
  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my  own hearts-blood.
  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a  true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and  mightier than Power, though he is mighty.
  Flame-coloured are his wings,  and coloured like flame is his body.
  His lips are sweet as honey, and  his breath is like frankincense.
    The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not  understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the  things that are written down in books.
    But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the  little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.
    Sing me one last song, he whispered; I shall feel very lonely when you  are gone.
    So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water  bubbling from a silver jar.
    When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book  and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.
    She has form, he said to himself, as he walked away through the  grovethat cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am  afraid not.
  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without  any sincerity.
  She would not sacrifice herself for others.
  She thinks  merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.
  Still,  it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.
  What  a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.
  And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and  began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.
    And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the  Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.
  All night long she sang  with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down  and listened.
  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and  deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.
    She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.
  And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous  rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.
  Pale was it, at  first, as the mist that hangs over the riverpale as the feet of the  morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.
  As the shadow of a rose in  a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the  rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.
    But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.
  Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, or the Day will come  before the rose is finished.
    So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and  louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of  a man and a maid.
    And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the  flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.
  But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the roses heart remained  white, for only a Nightingales hearts-blood can crimson the heart of a  rose.
    And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.
  Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, or the Day will come  before the rose is finished.
    So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn  touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.
  Bitter,  bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of  the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the  tomb.
    And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.
  Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.
    But the Nightingales voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to  beat, and a film came over her eyes.
  Fainter and fainter grew her song,  and she felt something choking her in her throat.
    Then she gave one last burst of music.
  The white Moon heard it, and she  forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.
  The red rose heard it, and  it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold  morning air.
  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke  the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.
  It floated through the reeds  of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.
    Look, look! cried the Tree, the rose is finished now; but the  Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass,  with the thorn in her heart.
    And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.
    Why, what a wonderful piece of luck! he cried; here is a red rose!  I  have never seen any rose like it in all my life.
  It is so beautiful that  I am sure it has a long Latin name; and he leaned down and plucked it.
    Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professors house with the rose  in his hand.
    The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue  silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.
    You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,  cried the Student.
  Here is the reddest rose in all the world.
  You will  wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell  you how I love you.
    But the girl frowned.
    I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered; and, besides,  the Chamberlains nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody  knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.
    Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily;  and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and  a cart-wheel went over it.
    Ungrateful! said the girl.
  I tell you what, you are very rude; and,  after all, who are you?  Only a Student.
  Why, I dont believe you have  even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlains nephew has;  and she got up from her chair and went into the house.
    What a silly thing Love is, said the Student as he walked away.
  It  is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is  always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one  believe things that are not true.
  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and,  as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to  Philosophy and study Metaphysics.
    So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began  to read.
              [Picture: Decorative graphic of nightingale and rose]          The Selfish Giant.
                             [Picture: The Selfish Giant]    EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go  and play in the Giants garden.
    It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.
  Here and there over  the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve  peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of  pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit.
  The birds sat on the  trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in  order to listen to them.
  How happy we are here! they cried to each  other.
               [Picture: Decorative graphic of children in garden]    One day the Giant came back.
  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish  ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.
  After the seven years  were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was  limited, and he determined to return to his own castle.
  When he arrived  he saw the children playing in the garden.
    What are you doing here? he cried in a very gruff voice, and the  children ran away.
    My own garden is my own garden, said the Giant; any one can understand  that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.
  So he built a  high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.
              TRESPASSERS                WILL BE               PROSECUTED    He was a very selfish Giant.
    The poor children had now nowhere to play.
  They tried to play on the  road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did  not like it.
  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons  were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.
  How happy we  were there, they said to each other.
    Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms  and little birds.
  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still  winter.
  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children,  and the trees forgot to blossom.
  Once a beautiful flower put its head  out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for  the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to  sleep.
  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.
  Spring has forgotten this garden, they cried, so we will live here all  the year round.
  The Snow covered up the grass with her great white  cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.
  Then they invited the  North Wind to stay with them, and he came.
  He was wrapped in furs, and  he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.
  This is a delightful spot, he said, we must ask the Hail on a visit.
  So the Hail came.
  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of  the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and  round the garden as fast as he could go.
  He was dressed in grey, and his  breath was like ice.
    I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming, said the  Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white  garden; I hope there will be a change in the weather.
    But the Spring never came, nor the Summer.
  The Autumn gave golden fruit  to every garden, but to the Giants garden she gave none.
  He is too  selfish, she said.
  So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind,  and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.
    One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely  music.
  It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the  Kings musicians passing by.
  It was really only a little linnet singing  outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in  his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the  world.
  Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind  ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open  casement.
  I believe the Spring has come at last, said the Giant; and  he jumped out of bed and looked out.
    What did he see?    He saw a most wonderful sight.
  Through a little hole in the wall the  children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the  trees.
  In every tree that he could see there was a little child.
  And  the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had  covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above  the childrens heads.
  The birds were flying about and twittering with  delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and  laughing.
  It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.
  It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little  boy.
  He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the  tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.
  The poor tree  was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was  blowing and roaring above it.
  Climb up! little boy, said the Tree, and  it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.
    And the Giants heart melted as he looked out.
  How selfish I have  been! he said; now I know why the Spring would not come here.
  I will  put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock  down the wall, and my garden shall be the childrens playground for ever  and ever.
  He was really very sorry for what he had done.
    So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went  out into the garden.
  But when the children saw him they were so  frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.
  Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that  he did not see the Giant coming.
  And the Giant stole up behind him and  took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.
  And the tree  broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the  little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giants  neck, and kissed him.
  And the other children, when they saw that the  Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came  the Spring.
  It is your garden now, little children, said the Giant,  and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.
  And when the people  were going to market at twelve oclock they found the Giant playing with  the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.
    All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to  bid him good-bye.
    But where is your little companion? he said: the boy I put into the  tree.
  The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.
    We dont know, answered the children; he has gone away.
    You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow, said the Giant.
  But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had  never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.
    Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with  the Giant.
  But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.
  The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first  little friend, and often spoke of him.
  How I would like to see him! he  used to say.
    Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble.
  He could not  play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the  children at their games, and admired his garden.
  I have many beautiful  flowers, he said; but the children are the most beautiful flowers of  all.
    One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.
  He  did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring  asleep, and that the flowers were resting.
    Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked.
  It  certainly was a marvellous sight.
  In the farthest corner of the garden  was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.
  Its branches were  all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood  the little boy he had loved.
    Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden.
  He  hastened across the grass, and came near to the child.
  And when he came  quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, Who hath dared to  wound thee?  For on the palms of the childs hands were the prints of  two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.
    Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant; tell me, that I may  take my big sword and slay him.
    Nay! answered the child; but these are the wounds of Love.
    Who art thou? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he  knelt before the little child.
    And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, You let me play once  in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is  Paradise.
    And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying  dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.
                     [Picture: Decorative graphic of wreath]          The Devoted Friend.
                            [Picture: Hans and the Miller]    ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.
  He had  bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long  bit of black india-rubber.
  The little ducks were swimming about in the  pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who  was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand  on their heads in the water.
    You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your  heads, she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them  how it was done.
  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.
  They  were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in  society at all.
    What disobedient children! cried the old Water-rat; they really  deserve to be drowned.
    Nothing of the kind, answered the Duck, every one must make a  beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.
    Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents, said the Water-rat;  I am not a family man.
  In fact, I have never been married, and I never  intend to be.
  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much  higher.
  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or  rarer than a devoted friendship.
    And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend? asked a  Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard  the conversation.
    Yes, that is just what I want to know, said the Duck; and she swam away  to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her  children a good example.
    What a silly question! cried the Water-rat.
  I should expect my  devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.
    And what would you do in return? said the little bird, swinging upon a  silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.
    I dont understand you, answered the Water-rat.
    Let me tell you a story on the subject, said the Linnet.
    Is the story about me? asked the Water-rat.
  If so, I will listen to  it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.
    It is applicable to you, answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and  alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.
    Once upon a time, said the Linnet, there was an honest little fellow  named Hans.
    Was he very distinguished? asked the Water-rat.
    No, answered the Linnet, I dont think he was distinguished at all,  except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.
  He  lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his  garden.
  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.
  Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds-purses, and  Fair-maids of France.
  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac  Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.
  Columbine and Ladysmock,  Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil  and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the  months went by, one flower taking another flowers place, so that there  were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.
    Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all  was big Hugh the Miller.
  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to  little Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over  the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or  filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.
    Real friends should have everything in common, the Miller used to say,  and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend  with such noble ideas.
    Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich  Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred  sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large  flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these  things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the  wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true  friendship.
    So little Hans worked away in his garden.
  During the spring, the  summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and  he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good  deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper  but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.
  In the winter, also, he was  extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.
    There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow  lasts, the Miller used to say to his wife, for when people are in  trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.
  That  at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.
  So I  shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and  he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make  him so happy.
    You are certainly very thoughtful about others, answered the Wife, as  she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; very  thoughtful indeed.
  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about  friendship.
  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful  things as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear  a gold ring on his little finger.
    But could we not ask little Hans up here? said the Millers youngest  son.
  If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and  show him my white rabbits.
    What a silly boy you are! cried the Miller; I really dont know what  is the use of sending you to school.
  You seem not to learn anything.
  Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good  supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is  a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybodys nature.
  I certainly  will not allow Hans nature to be spoiled.
  I am his best friend, and I  will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any  temptations.
  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have  some flour on credit, and that I could not do.
  Flour is one thing, and  friendship is another, and they should not be confused.
  Why, the words  are spelt differently, and mean quite different things.
  Everybody can  see that.
    How well you talk! said the Millers Wife, pouring herself out a large  glass of warm ale; really I feel quite drowsy.
  It is just like being in  church.
    Lots of people act well, answered the Miller; but very few people  talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of  the two, and much the finer thing also; and he looked sternly across the  table at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his  head down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.
  However, he was so young that you must excuse him.
    Is that the end of the story? asked the Water-rat.
    Certainly not, answered the Linnet, that is the beginning.
    Then you are quite behind the age, said the Water-rat.
  Every good  story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the  beginning, and concludes with the middle.
  That is the new method.
  I  heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the  pond with a young man.
  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am  sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,  and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered Pooh!  But pray go on with your story.
  I like the Miller immensely.
  I have all  kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy  between us.
    Well, said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, as  soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale  yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see  little Hans.
    Why, what a good heart you have! cried his Wife; you are always  thinking of others.
  And mind you take the big basket with you for the  flowers.
    So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron  chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.
    Good morning, little Hans, said the Miller.
    Good morning, said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to  ear.
    And how have you been all the winter? said the Miller.
    Well, really, cried Hans, it is very good of you to ask, very good  indeed.
  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring  has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.
    We often talked of you during the winter, Hans, said the Miller, and  wondered how you were getting on.
    That was kind of you, said Hans; I was half afraid you had forgotten  me.
    Hans, I am surprised at you, said the Miller; friendship never  forgets.
  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you dont  understand the poetry of life.
  How lovely your primroses are looking,  by-the-bye!    They are certainly very lovely, said Hans, and it is a most lucky  thing for me that I have so many.
  I am going to bring them into the  market and sell them to the Burgomasters daughter, and buy back my  wheelbarrow with the money.
    Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You dont mean to say you have sold it?  What a very stupid thing to do!    Well, the fact is, said Hans, that I was obliged to.
  You see the  winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to  buy bread with.
  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,  and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last  I sold my wheelbarrow.
  But I am going to buy them all back again now.
    Hans, said the Miller, I will give you my wheelbarrow.
  It is not in  very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong  with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.
  I  know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me  extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the  world.
  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,  besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.
  Yes, you may set your  mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.
    Well, really, that is generous of you, said little Hans, and his funny  round face glowed all over with pleasure.
  I can easily put it in  repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.
    A plank of wood! said the Miller; why, that is just what I want for  the roof of my barn.
  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will  all get damp if I dont stop it up.
  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is  quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.
  I have given  you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.
  Of  course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,  friendship never notices things like that.
  Pray get it at once, and I  will set to work at my barn this very day.
    Certainly, cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the  plank out.
    It is not a very big plank, said the Miller, looking at it, and I am  afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there wont be any left for  you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.
  And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to  give me some flowers in return.
  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it  quite full.
    Quite full? said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a  very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no  flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver  buttons back.
    Well, really, answered the Miller, as I have given you my  wheelbarrow, I dont think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.
  I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true  friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.
    My dear friend, my best friend, cried little Hans, you are welcome to  all the flowers in my garden.
  I would much sooner have your good opinion  than my silver buttons, any day; and he ran and plucked all his pretty  primroses, and filled the Millers basket.
    Good-bye, little Hans, said the Miller, as he went up the hill with  the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.
    Good-bye, said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he  was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.
    The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when  he heard the Millers voice calling to him from the road.
  So he jumped  off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.
    There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.
    Dear little Hans, said the Miller, would you mind carrying this sack  of flour for me to market?    Oh, I am so sorry, said Hans, but I am really very busy to-day.
  I  have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all  my grass to roll.
    Well, really, said the Miller, I think that, considering that I am  going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to  refuse.
    Oh, dont say that, cried little Hans, I wouldnt be unfriendly for  the whole world; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big  sack on his shoulders.
    It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans  had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down  and rest.
  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the  market.
  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour  for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was  afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.
    It has certainly been a hard day, said little Hans to himself as he  was going to bed, but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is  my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.
    Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his  sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.
    Upon my word, said the Miller, you are very lazy.
  Really,  considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might  work harder.
  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly dont like any of  my friends to be idle or sluggish.
  You must not mind my speaking quite  plainly to you.
  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not  your friend.
  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say  exactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to  please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,  and does not mind giving pain.
  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he  prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.
    I am very sorry, said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off  his night-cap, but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for  a little time, and listen to the birds singing.
  Do you know that I  always work better after hearing the birds sing?    Well, I am glad of that, said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the  back, for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,  and mend my barn-roof for me.
    Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his  flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse  the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.
    Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy? he  inquired in a shy and timid voice.
    Well, really, answered the Miller, I do not think it is much to ask  of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of  course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.
    Oh! on no account, cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and  dressed himself, and went up to the barn.
    He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came  to see how he was getting on.
    Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans? cried the  Miller in a cheery voice.
    It is quite mended, answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.
    Ah! said the Miller, there is no work so delightful as the work one  does for others.
    It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk, answered little  Hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, a very great privilege.
  But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.
    Oh! they will come to you, said the Miller, but you must take more  pains.
  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you  will have the theory also.
    Do you really think I shall? asked little Hans.
    I have no doubt of it, answered the Miller, but now that you have  mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive  my sheep to the mountain to-morrow.
    Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next  morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans  started off with them to the mountain.
  It took him the whole day to get  there and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to  sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.
    What a delightful time I shall have in my garden, he said, and he went  to work at once.
    But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his  friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long  errands, or getting him to help at the mill.
  Little Hans was very much  distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had  forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller  was his best friend.
  Besides, he used to say, he is going to give me  his wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.
    So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds  of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a  note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good  scholar.
    Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside  when a loud rap came at the door.
  It was a very wild night, and the wind  was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he  thought it was merely the storm.
  But a second rap came, and then a  third, louder than any of the others.
    It is some poor traveller, said little Hans to himself, and he ran to  the door.
    There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the  other.
    Dear little Hans, cried the Miller, I am in great trouble.
  My little  boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the  Doctor.
  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it  has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead  of me.
  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is  only fair that you should do something for me in return.
    Certainly, cried little Hans, I take it quite as a compliment your  coming to me, and I will start off at once.
  But you must lend me your  lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the  ditch.
    I am very sorry, answered the Miller, but it is my new lantern, and  it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.
    Well, never mind, I will do without it, cried little Hans, and he took  down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler  round his throat, and started off.
    What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans  could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely  stand.
  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking  about three hours, he arrived at the Doctors house, and knocked at the  door.
    Who is there? cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom  window.
    Little Hans, Doctor.
    What do you want, little Hans?    The Millers son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and  the Miller wants you to come at once.
    All right! said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big  boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the  direction of the Millers house, little Hans trudging behind him.
    But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and  little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.
  At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very  dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans  was drowned.
  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating  in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.
    Everybody went to little Hans funeral, as he was so popular, and the  Miller was the chief mourner.
    As I was his best friend, said the Miller, it is only fair that I  should have the best place; so he walked at the head of the procession  in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a  big pocket-handkerchief.
    Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one, said the  Blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated  comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.
    A great loss to me at any rate, answered the Miller; why, I had as  good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really dont know what to do  with it.
  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair  that I could not get anything for it if I sold it.
  I will certainly take  care not to give away anything again.
  One always suffers for being  generous.
    Well? said the Water-rat, after a long pause.
    Well, that is the end, said the Linnet.
    But what became of the Miller? asked the Water-rat.
    Oh!  I really dont know, replied the Linnet; and I am sure that I  dont care.
    It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature, said  the Water-rat.
    I am afraid you dont quite see the moral of the story, remarked the  Linnet.
    The what? screamed the Water-rat.
    The moral.
    Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?    Certainly, said the Linnet.
    Well, really, said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, I think you  should have told me that before you began.
  If you had done so, I  certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said  Pooh, like the critic.
  However, I can say it now; so he shouted out  Pooh at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back  into his hole.
    And how do you like the Water-rat? asked the Duck, who came paddling up  some minutes afterwards.
  He has a great many good points, but for my  own part I have a mothers feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed  bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.
    I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him, answered the Linnet.
  The  fact is, that I told him a story with a moral.
    Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do, said the Duck.
    And I quite agree with her.
         [Picture: Decorative graphic of windmill and overturned barrow]          The Remarkable Rocket.
                           [Picture: The Remarkable Rocket]    THE Kings son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.
  He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.
  She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a  sledge drawn by six reindeer.
  The sledge was shaped like a great golden  swan, and between the swans wings lay the little Princess herself.
  Her  long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny  cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she  had always lived.
  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets  all the people wondered.
  She is like a white rose! they cried, and  they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.
      [Picture: Decorative graphic of young man kissing the princess hand]    At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.
  He had  dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.
  When he saw her he  sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.
    Your picture was beautiful, he murmured, but you are more beautiful  than your picture; and the little Princess blushed.
    She was like a white rose before, said a young Page to his neighbour,  but she is like a red rose now; and the whole Court was delighted.
    For the next three days everybody went about saying, White rose, Red  rose, Red rose, White rose; and the King gave orders that the Pages  salary was to be doubled.
  As he received no salary at all this was not  of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly  published in the Court Gazette.
    When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.
  It was a  magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand  under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.
  Then  there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.
  The Prince and  Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear  crystal.
  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips  touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.
    Its quite clear that they love each other, said the little Page, as  clear as crystal! and the King doubled his salary a second time.
  What  an honour! cried all the courtiers.
    After the banquet there was to be a Ball.
  The bride and bridegroom were  to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the  flute.
  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,  because he was the King.
  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never  quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,  whatever he did, everybody cried out, Charming! charming!    The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be  let off exactly at midnight.
  The little Princess had never seen a  firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal  Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.
    What are fireworks like? she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she  was walking on the terrace.
    They are like the Aurora Borealis, said the King, who always answered  questions that were addressed to other people, only much more natural.
  I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to  appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.
  You must  certainly see them.
    So at the end of the Kings garden a great stand had been set up, and as  soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,  the fireworks began to talk to each other.
    The world is certainly very beautiful, cried a little Squib.
  Just  look at those yellow tulips.
  Why! if they were real crackers they could  not be lovelier.
  I am very glad I have travelled.
  Travel improves the  mind wonderfully, and does away with all ones prejudices.
    The Kings garden is not the world, you foolish squib, said a big Roman  Candle; the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days  to see it thoroughly.
    Any place you love is the world to you, exclaimed a pensive Catherine  Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided  herself on her broken heart; but love is not fashionable any more, the  poets have killed it.
  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed  them, and I am not surprised.
  True love suffers, and is silent.
  I  remember myself onceBut it is no matter now.
  Romance is a thing of the  past.
    Nonsense! said the Roman Candle, Romance never dies.
  It is like the  moon, and lives for ever.
  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love  each other very dearly.
  I heard all about them this morning from a  brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as  myself, and knew the latest Court news.
    But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.
  Romance is dead, Romance is  dead, Romance is dead, she murmured.
  She was one of those people who  think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,  it becomes true in the end.
    Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.
    It came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end  of a long stick.
  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as  to attract attention.
    Ahem! ahem! he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine  Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, Romance is dead.
    Order! order! cried out a Cracker.
  He was something of a politician,  and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew  the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.
    Quite dead, whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.
    As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and  began.
  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating  his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he  was talking.
  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.
    How fortunate it is for the Kings son, he remarked, that he is to be  married on the very day on which I am to be let off.
  Really, if it had  been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;  but, Princes are always lucky.
    Dear me! said the little Squib, I thought it was quite the other way,  and that we were to be let off in the Princes honour.
    It may be so with you, he answered; indeed, I have no doubt that it  is, but with me it is different.
  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come  of remarkable parents.
  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel  of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.
  When she made her  great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went  out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink  stars.
  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very  best gunpowder.
  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French  extraction.
  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would  never come down again.
  He did, though, for he was of a kindly  disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden  rain.
  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering  terms.
  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic  art.
    Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean, said a Bengal Light; I know it is  Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.
    Well, I said Pylotechnic, answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of  voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to  bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of  some importance.
    I was saying, continued the Rocket, I was sayingWhat was I saying?    You were talking about yourself, replied the Roman Candle.
    Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was  so rudely interrupted.
  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,  for I am extremely sensitive.
  No one in the whole world is so sensitive  as I am, I am quite sure of that.
    What is a sensitive person? said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.
    A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other  peoples toes, answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the  Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.
    Pray, what are you laughing at? inquired the Rocket; I am not  laughing.
    I am laughing because I am happy, replied the Cracker.
    That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily.
  What right  have you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.
  In fact, you  should be thinking about me.
  I am always thinking about myself, and I  expect everybody else to do the same.
  That is what is called sympathy.
  It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.
  Suppose,  for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that  would be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy  again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I  know he would not get over it.
  Really, when I begin to reflect on the  importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.
    If you want to give pleasure to others, cried the Roman Candle, you  had better keep yourself dry.
    Certainly, exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;  that is only common sense.
    Common sense, indeed! said the Rocket indignantly; you forget that I  am very uncommon, and very remarkable.
  Why, anybody can have common  sense, provided that they have no imagination.
  But I have imagination,  for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as  being quite different.
  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no  one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.
  Fortunately for  myself, I dont care.
  The only thing that sustains one through life is  the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this  is a feeling that I have always cultivated.
  But none of you have any  hearts.
  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and  Princess had not just been married.
    Well, really, exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, why not?  It is a most  joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the  stars all about it.
  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about  the pretty bride.
    Ah! what a trivial view of life! said the Rocket; but it is only what  I expected.
  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.
  Why,  perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there  is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little  fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps  some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may  go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall  into the deep river and be drowned.
  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor  people, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall  never get over it.
    But they have not lost their only son, said the Roman Candle; no  misfortune has happened to them at all.
    I never said that they had, replied the Rocket; I said that they  might.
  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying  anything more about the matter.
  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.
  But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very  much affected.
    You certainly are! cried the Bengal Light.
  In fact, you are the most  affected person I ever met.
    You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, and you cannot  understand my friendship for the Prince.
    Why, you dont even know him, growled the Roman Candle.
    I never said I knew him, answered the Rocket.
  I dare say that if I  knew him I should not be his friend at all.
  It is a very dangerous thing  to know ones friends.
    You had really better keep yourself dry, said the Fire-balloon.
  That  is the important thing.
    Very important for you, I have no doubt, answered the Rocket, but I  shall weep if I choose; and he actually burst into real tears, which  flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little  beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were  looking for a nice dry spot to live in.
    He must have a truly romantic nature, said the Catherine Wheel, for he  weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about; and she heaved a deep  sigh, and thought about the deal box.
    But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept  saying, Humbug! humbug! at the top of their voices.
  They were  extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called  it humbug.
    Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to  shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.
    The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.
  They danced so  beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and  watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.
    Then ten oclock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the  last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King  sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.
    Let the fireworks begin, said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made  a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.
  He had six  attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a  long pole.
    It was certainly a magnificent display.
    Whizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.
  Boom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.
  Then the Squibs danced all over the  place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.
  Good-bye,  cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.
  Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves  immensely.
  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.
  He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.
  The best  thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it  was of no use.
  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,  except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers  with blossoms of fire.
  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little  Princess laughed with pleasure.
    I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion, said the  Rocket; no doubt that is what it means, and he looked more supercilious  than ever.
    The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.
  This is evidently  a deputation, said the Rocket; I will receive them with becoming  dignity so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if  he were thinking about some very important subject.
  But they took no  notice of him at all till they were just going away.
  Then one of them  caught sight of him.
  Hallo! he cried, what a bad rocket! and he  threw him over the wall into the ditch.
    BAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket? he said, as he whirled through the air;  impossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.
  BAD and GRAND  sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same; and he fell  into the mud.
    It is not comfortable here, he remarked, but no doubt it is some  fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my  health.
  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require  rest.
    Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,  swam up to him.
    A new arrival, I see! said the Frog.
  Well, after all there is nothing  like mud.
  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.
  Do  you think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky  is quite blue and cloudless.
  What a pity!    Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket, and he began to cough.
    What a delightful voice you have! cried the Frog.
  Really it is quite  like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the  world.
  You will hear our glee-club this evening.
  We sit in the old duck  pond close by the farmers house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.
  It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.
  In fact,  it was only yesterday that I heard the farmers wife say to her mother  that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.
  It is  most gratifying to find oneself so popular.
    Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket angrily.
  He was very much annoyed that he  could not get a word in.
    A delightful voice, certainly, continued the Frog; I hope you will  come over to the duck-pond.
  I am off to look for my daughters.
  I have  six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.
  He  is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off  them.
  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I  assure you.
    Conversation, indeed! said the Rocket.
  You have talked the whole time  yourself.
  That is not conversation.
    Somebody must listen, answered the Frog, and I like to do all the  talking myself.
  It saves time, and prevents arguments.
    But I like arguments, said the Rocket.
    I hope not, said the Frog complacently.
  Arguments are extremely  vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.
  Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little  Frog swam away.
    You are a very irritating person, said the Rocket, and very ill-bred.
  I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to  talk about oneself, as I do.
  It is what I call selfishness, and  selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my  temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.
  In fact, you  should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.
  Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I  am going back to Court almost immediately.
  I am a great favourite at  Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my  honour.
  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a  provincial.
    There is no good talking to him, said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on  the top of a large brown bulrush; no good at all, for he has gone away.
    Well, that is his loss, not mine, answered the Rocket.
  I am not going  to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.
  I like  hearing myself talk.
  It is one of my greatest pleasures.
  I often have  long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I  dont understand a single word of what I am saying.
    Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy, said the Dragon-fly;  and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.
    How very silly of him not to stay here! said the Rocket.
  I am sure  that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.
  However,  I dont care a bit.
  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some  day; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.
    After some time a large White Duck swam up to him.
  She had yellow legs,  and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her  waddle.
    Quack, quack, quack, she said.
  What a curious shape you are!  May I  ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?    It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered  the Rocket, otherwise you would know who I am.
  However, I excuse your  ignorance.
  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable  as oneself.
  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up  into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.
    I dont think much of that, said the Duck, as I cannot see what use it  is to any one.
  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw  a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that  would be something.
    My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, I  see that you belong to the lower orders.
  A person of my position is  never useful.
  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than  sufficient.
  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least  of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.
  Indeed, I have  always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who  have nothing whatever to do.
    Well, well, said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and  never quarrelled with any one, everybody has different tastes.
  I hope,  at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.
    Oh! dear no, cried the Rocket.
  I am merely a visitor, a distinguished  visitor.
  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.
  There is  neither society here, nor solitude.
  In fact, it is essentially suburban.
  I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make  a sensation in the world.
    I had thoughts of entering public life once myself, remarked the Duck;  there are so many things that need reforming.
  Indeed, I took the chair  at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning  everything that we did not like.
  However, they did not seem to have much  effect.
  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.
    I am made for public life, said the Rocket, and so are all my  relations, even the humblest of them.
  Whenever we appear we excite great  attention.
  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will  be a magnificent sight.
  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and  distracts ones mind from higher things.
    Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are! said the Duck; and  that reminds me how hungry I feel: and she swam away down the stream,  saying, Quack, quack, quack.
    Come back! come back! screamed the Rocket, I have a great deal to say  to you; but the Duck paid no attention to him.
  I am glad that she has  gone, he said to himself, she has a decidedly middle-class mind; and  he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the  loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came  running down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.
    This must be the deputation, said the Rocket, and he tried to look very  dignified.
    Hallo! cried one of the boys, look at this old stick!  I wonder how it  came here; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.
    OLD Stick! said the Rocket, impossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he  said.
  Gold Stick is very complimentary.
  In fact, he mistakes me for one  of the Court dignitaries!    Let us put it into the fire! said the other boy, it will help to boil  the kettle.
    So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit  the fire.
    This is magnificent, cried the Rocket, they are going to let me off in  broad day-light, so that every one can see me.
    We will go to sleep now, they said, and when we wake up the kettle  will be boiled; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.
    The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.
  At last,  however, the fire caught him.
    Now I am going off! he cried, and he made himself very stiff and  straight.
  I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher  than the moon, much higher than the sun.
  In fact, I shall go so high  that    Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.
    Delightful! he cried, I shall go on like this for ever.
  What a  success I am!    But nobody saw him.
    Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.
    Now I am going to explode, he cried.
  I shall set the whole world on  fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for  a whole year.
  And he certainly did explode.
  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the  gunpowder.
  There was no doubt about it.
    But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound  asleep.
    Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the  back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.
    Good heavens! cried the Goose.
  It is going to rain sticks; and she  rushed into the water.
    I knew I should create a great sensation, gasped the Rocket, and he  went out.

, President Aero Club  of Illinois    1912          PREFACE.
    This book is written for the guidance of the novice in aviation--the  man who seeks practical information as to the theory, construction and  operation of the modern flying machine.
 With this object in view the  wording is intentionally plain and non-technical.
 It contains some  propositions which, so far as satisfying the experts is concerned, might  doubtless be better stated in technical terms, but this would defeat the  main purpose of its preparation.
 Consequently, while fully aware of its  shortcomings in this respect, the authors have no apologies to make.
    In the stating of a technical proposition so it may be clearly  understood by people not versed in technical matters it becomes  absolutely necessary to use language much different from that which an  expert would employ, and this has been done in this volume.
    No man of ordinary intelligence can read this book without obtaining  a clear, comprehensive knowledge of flying machine construction and  operation.
 He will learn, not only how to build, equip, and manipulate  an aeroplane in actual flight, but will also gain a thorough  understanding of the principle upon which the suspension in the air of  an object much heavier than the air is made possible.
    This latter feature should make the book of interest even to those who  have no intention of constructing or operating a flying machine.
 It will  enable them to better understand and appreciate the performances of the  daring men like the Wright brothers, Curtiss, Bleriot, Farman, Paulhan,  Latham, and others, whose bold experiments have made aviation an  actuality.
    For those who wish to engage in the fascinating pastime of construction  and operation it is intended as a reliable, practical guide.
    It may be well to explain that the sub-headings in the articles by Mr.  Chanute were inserted by the authors without his knowledge.
 The purpose  of this was merely to preserve uniformity in the typography of the book.
  This explanation is made in justice to Mr. Chanute.
    THE AUTHORS.
          IN MEMORIAM.
    Octave Chanute, "the father of the modern flying machine," died at his  home in Chicago on November 23, 1910, at the age of 72 years.
 His last  work in the interest of aviation was to furnish the introductory chapter  to the first edition of this volume, and to render valuable assistance  in the handling of the various subjects.
 He even made the trip from his  home to the office of the publishers one inclement day last spring,  to look over the proofs of the book and, at his suggestion, several  important changes were made.
 All this was "a labor of love" on Mr.  Chanute's part.
 He gave of his time and talents freely because he was  enthusiastic in the cause of aviation, and because he knew the authors  of this book and desired to give them material aid in the preparation of  the work--a favor that was most sincerely appreciated.
      The authors desire to make acknowledgment of many courtesies in the way  of valuable advice, information, etc.

 EVOLUTION OF TWO-SURFACE FLYING MACHINE.
    By Octave Chanute.
      I am asked to set forth the development of the "two-surface" type of  flying machine which is now used with modifications by Wright Brothers,  Farman, [1] Delagrange, Herring and others.
    This type originated with Mr. F.
 H.
 Wenham, who patented it in  England in 1866 (No.
 1571), taking out provisional papers only.
 In the  abridgment of British patent Aeronautical Specifications (1893) it is  described as follows:    "Two or more aeroplanes are arranged one above the other, and support a  framework or car containing the motive power.
 The aeroplanes are made of  silk or canvas stretched on a frame by wooden rods or steel ribs.
 When  manual power is employed the body is placed horizontally, and oars or  propellers are actuated by the arms or legs.
    "A start may be obtained by lowering the legs and running down hill or  the machine may be started from a moving carriage.
 One or more screw  propellers may be applied for propelling when steam power is employed.
"    On June 27, 1866, Mr. Wenham read before the "Aeronautical Society of  Great Britain," then recently organized, the ablest paper ever presented  to that society, and thereby breathed into it a spirit which has  continued to this day.
 In this paper he described his observations of  birds, discussed the laws governing flight as to the surfaces and power  required both with wings and screws, and he then gave an account of his  own experiments with models and with aeroplanes of sufficient size to  carry the weight of a man.
    Second Wenham Aeroplane.
    His second aeroplane was sixteen feet from tip to tip.
 A trussed spar at  the bottom carried six superposed bands of thin holland fabric fifteen  inches wide, connected with vertical webs of holland two feet apart,  thus virtually giving a length of wing of ninety-six feet and one  hundred and twenty square feet of supporting surface.
 The man was placed  horizontally on a base board beneath the spar.
 This apparatus when tried  in the wind was found to be unmanageable by reason of the fluttering  motions of the fabric, which was insufficiently stiffened with crinoline  steel, but Mr. Wenham pointed out that this in no way invalidated  the principle of the apparatus, which was to obtain large supporting  surfaces without increasing unduly the leverage and consequent weight of  spar required, by simply superposing the surfaces.
    This principle is entirely sound and it is surprising that it is,  to this day, not realized by those aviators who are hankering for  monoplanes.
    Experiments by Stringfellow.
    The next man to test an apparatus with superposed surfaces was Mr.  Stringfellow, who, becoming much impressed with Mr. Wenham's proposal,  produced a largish model at the exhibition of the Aeronautical Society  in 1868.
 It consisted of three superposed surfaces aggregating 28 square  feet and a tail of 8 square feet more.
 The weight was under 12 pounds  and it was driven by a central propeller actuated by a steam engine  overestimated at one-third of a horsepower.
 It ran suspended to a wire  on its trials but failed of free flight, in consequence of defective  equilibrium.
 This apparatus has since been rebuilt and is now in the  National Museum of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington.
 Linfield's  Unsuccessful Efforts.
    In 1878 Mr. Linfield tested an apparatus in England consisting of a  cigar-shaped car, to which was attached on each side frames five feet  square, containing each twenty-five superposed planes of stretched and  varnished linen eighteen inches wide, and only two inches apart, thus  reminding one of a Spanish donkey with panniers.
 The whole weighed two  hundred and forty pounds.
 This was tested by being mounted on a flat car  behind a locomotive going 40 miles an hour.
 When towed by a line fifteen  feet long the apparatus rose only a little from the car and exhibited  such unstable equilibrium that the experiment was not renewed.
 The lift  was only about one-third of what it would have been had the planes been  properly spaced, say their full width apart, instead of one-ninth as  erroneously devised.
    Renard's "Dirigible Parachute.
"    In 1889 Commandant Renard, the eminent superintendent of the French  Aeronautical Department, exhibited at the Paris Exposition of that year,  an apparatus experimented with some years before, which he termed a  "dirigible parachute.
" It consisted of an oviform body to which were  pivoted two upright slats carrying above the body nine long superposed  flat blades spaced about one-third of their width apart.
 When this  apparatus was properly set at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the  body and dropped from a balloon, it travelled back against the wind for  a considerable distance before alighting.
 The course could be varied  by a rudder.
 No practical application seems to have been made of this  device by the French War Department, but Mr. J.
 P.
 Holland, the  inventor of the submarine boat which bears his name, proposed in 1893  an arrangement of pivoted framework attached to the body of a flying  machine which combines the principle of Commandant Renard with the  curved blades experimented with by Mr. Phillips, now to be noticed, with  the addition of lifting screws inserted among the blades.
    Phillips Fails on Stability Problem.
    In 1893 Mr. Horatio Phillips, of England, after some very interesting  experiments with various wing sections, from which he deduced  conclusions as to the shape of maximum lift, tested an apparatus  resembling a Venetian blind which consisted of fifty wooden slats of  peculiar shape, 22 feet long, one and a half inches wide, and two inches  apart, set in ten vertical upright boards.
 All this was carried upon a  body provided with three wheels.
 It weighed 420 pounds and was driven  at 40 miles an hour on a wooden sidewalk by a steam engine of nine  horsepower which actuated a two-bladed screw.
 The lift was satisfactory,  being perhaps 70 pounds per horsepower, but the equilibrium was quite  bad and the experiments were discontinued.
 They were taken up again in  1904 with a similar apparatus large enough to carry a passenger, but the  longitudinal equilibrium was found to be defective.
 Then in 1907 a new  machine was tested, in which four sets of frames, carrying similar  sets of slat "sustainers" were inserted, and with this arrangement the  longitudinal stability was found to be very satisfactory.
 The whole  apparatus, with the operator, weighed 650 pounds.
 It flew about 200  yards when driven by a motor of 20 to 22 h.
p.
 at 30 miles an hour,  thus exhibiting a lift of about 32 pounds per h.
p.
, while it will be  remembered that the aeroplane of Wright Brothers exhibits a lifting  capacity of 50 pounds to the h.
p.
    Hargrave's Kite Experiments.
    After experimenting with very many models and building no less than  eighteen monoplane flying model machines, actuated by rubber, by  compressed air and by steam, Mr. Lawrence Hargrave, of Sydney, New South  Wales, invented the cellular kite which bears his name and made it known  in a paper contributed to the Chicago Conference on Aerial Navigation  in 1893, describing several varieties.
 The modern construction is well  known, and consists of two cells, each of superposed surfaces with  vertical side fins, placed one behind the other and connected by a  rod or frame.
 This flies with great steadiness without a tail.
 Mr.  Hargrave's idea was to use a team of these kites, below which he  proposed to suspend a motor and propeller from which a line would be  carried to an anchor in the ground.
 Then by actuating the propeller the  whole apparatus would move forward, pick up the anchor and fly away.
 He  said: "The next step is clear enough, namely, that a flying machine with  acres of surface can be safely got under way or anchored and hauled to  the ground by means of the string of kites.
"    The first tentative experiments did not result well and emphasized the  necessity for a light motor, so that Mr. Hargrave has since been engaged  in developing one, not having convenient access to those which have been  produced by the automobile designers and builders.
    Experiments With Glider Model.
    And here a curious reminiscence may be indulged in.
 In 1888 the present  writer experimented with a two-cell gliding model, precisely similar to  a Hargrave kite, as will be confirmed by Mr. Herring.
 It was frequently  tested by launching from the top of a three-story house and glided  downward very steadily in all sorts of breezes, but the angle of descent  was much steeper than that of birds, and the weight sustained per square  foot was less than with single cells, in consequence of the lesser  support afforded by the rear cell, which operated upon air already set  in motion downward by the front cell, so nothing more was done with  it, for it never occurred to the writer to try it as a kite and he thus  missed the distinction which attaches to Hargrave's name.
    Sir Hiram Maxim also introduced fore and aft superposed surfaces in his  wondrous flying machine of 1893, but he relied chiefly for the lift upon  his main large surface and this necessitated so many guys, to prevent  distortion, as greatly to increase the head resistance and this,  together with the unstable equilibrium, made it evident that the design  of the machine would have to be changed.
    How Lilienthal Was Killed.
    In 1895, Otto Lilienthal, the father of modern aviation, the man to  whose method of experimenting almost all present successes are due,  after making something like two thousand glides with monoplanes, added  a superposed surface to his apparatus and found the control of it much  improved.
 The two surfaces were kept apart by two struts or vertical  posts with a few guy wires, but the connecting joints were weak and  there was nothing like trussing.
 This eventually cost his most useful  life.
 Two weeks before that distressing loss to science, Herr Wilhelm  Kress, the distinguished and veteran aviator of Vienna, witnessed a  number of glides by Lilienthal with his double-decked apparatus.
 He  noticed that it was much wracked and wobbly and wrote to me after the  accident: "The connection of the wings and the steering arrangement were  very bad and unreliable.
 I warned Herr Lilienthal very seriously.
 He  promised me that he would soon put it in order, but I fear that he did  not attend to it immediately.
"    In point of fact, Lilienthal had built a new machine, upon a different  principle, from which he expected great results, and intended to make  but very few more flights with the old apparatus.
 He unwisely made one  too many and, like Pilcher, was the victim of a distorted apparatus.
  Probably one of the joints of the struts gave way, the upper surface  blew back and Lilienthal, who was well forward on the lower surface, was  pitched headlong to destruction.
    Experiments by the Writer.
    In 1896, assisted by Mr. Herring and Mr. Avery, I experimented with  several full sized gliding machines, carrying a man.
 The first was a  Lilienthal monoplane which was deemed so cranky that it was discarded  after making about one hundred glides, six weeks before Lilienthal's  accident.
 The second was known as the multiple winged machine and  finally developed into five pairs of pivoted wings, trussed together at  the front and one pair in the rear.
 It glided at angles of descent of 10  or 11 degrees or of one in five, and this was deemed too steep.
 Then  Mr. Herring and myself made computations to analyze the resistances.
 We  attributed much of them to the five front spars of the wings and on  a sheet of cross-barred paper I at once drew the design for a new  three-decked machine to be built by Mr. Herring.
    Being a builder of bridges, I trussed these surfaces together, in order  to obtain strength and stiffness.
 When tested in gliding flight the  lower surface was found too near the ground.
 It was taken off and the  remaining apparatus now consisted of two surfaces connected together  by a girder composed of vertical posts and diagonal ties, specifically  known as a "Pratt truss.
" Then Mr. Herring and Mr. Avery together  devised and put on an elastic attachment to the tail.
 This machine  proved a success, it being safe and manageable.
 Over 700 glides were  made with it at angles of descent of 8 to 10 degrees, or one in six to  one in seven.
    First Proposed by Wenham.
    The elastic tail attachment and the trussing of the connecting frame of  the superposed wings were the only novelties in this machine, for the  superposing of the surfaces had first been proposed by Wenham, but in  accordance with the popular perception, which bestows all the credit  upon the man who adds the last touch making for success to the labors  of his predecessors, the machine has since been known by many persons as  the "Chanute type" of gliders, much to my personal gratification.
    It has since been improved in many ways.
 Wright Brothers, disregarding  the fashion which prevails among birds, have placed the tail in front  of their apparatus and called it a front rudder, besides placing the  operator in horizontal position instead of upright, as I did; and also  providing a method of warping the wings to preserve equilibrium.
 Farman  and Delagrange, under the very able guidance and constructive work of  Voisin brothers, then substituted many details, including a box tail for  the dart-like tail which I used.
 This may have increased the resistance,  but it adds to the steadiness.
 Now the tendency in France seems to be to  go back to the monoplane.
    Monoplane Idea Wrong.
    The advocates of the single supporting surface are probably mistaken.
 It  is true that a single surface shows a greater lift per square foot than  superposed surfaces for a given speed, but the increased weight due to  leverage more than counterbalances this advantage by requiring heavy  spars and some guys.
 I believe that the future aeroplane dynamic flier  will consist of superposed surfaces, and, now that it has been found  that by imbedding suitably shaped spars in the cloth the head resistance  may be much diminished, I see few objections to superposing three, four  or even five surfaces properly trussed, and thus obtaining a compact,  handy, manageable and comparatively light apparatus.
 [2]        .
 THEORY, DEVELOPMENT, AND USE.
      While every craft that navigates the air is an airship, all airships are  not flying machines.
 The balloon, for instance, is an airship, but it is  not what is known among aviators as a flying machine.
 This latter term  is properly used only in referring to heavier-than-air machines which  have no gas-bag lifting devices, and are made to really fly by the  application of engine propulsion.
    Mechanical Birds.
    All successful flying machines--and there are a number of them--are  based on bird action.
 The various designers have studied bird flight  and soaring, mastered its technique as devised by Nature, and the modern  flying machine is the result.
 On an exaggerated, enlarged scale the  machines which are now navigating the air are nothing more nor less than  mechanical birds.
    Origin of the Aeroplane.
    Octave Chanute, of Chicago, may well be called "the developer of the  flying machine.
" Leaving balloons and various forms of gas-bags out  of consideration, other experimenters, notably Langley and Lilienthal,  antedated him in attempting the navigation of the air on aeroplanes,  or flying machines, but none of them were wholly successful, and it  remained for Chanute to demonstrate the practicability of what was then  called the gliding machine.
 This term was adopted because the apparatus  was, as the name implies, simply a gliding machine, being without motor  propulsion, and intended solely to solve the problem of the best form of  construction.
 The biplane, used by Chanute in 1896, is still the basis  of most successful flying machines, the only radical difference being  that motors, rudders, etc.
, have been added.
    Character of Chanute's Experiments.
    It was the privilege of the author of this book to be Mr. Chanute's  guest at Millers, Indiana, in 1896, when, in collaboration with Messrs.
  Herring and Avery, he was conducting the series of experiments which  have since made possible the construction of the modern flying machine  which such successful aviators as the Wright brothers and others are  now using.
 It was a wild country, much frequented by eagles, hawks, and  similar birds.
 The enthusiastic trio, Chanute, Herring and Avery, would  watch for hours the evolutions of some big bird in the air, agreeing  in the end on the verdict, "When we master the principle of that bird's  soaring without wing action, we will have come close to solving the  problem of the flying machine.
"    Aeroplanes of various forms were constructed by Mr. Chanute with the  assistance of Messrs.
 Herring and Avery until, at the time of the  writer's visit, they had settled upon the biplane, or two-surface  machine.
 Mr. Herring later equipped this with a rudder, and made other  additions, but the general idea is still the basis of the Wright,  Curtiss, and other machines in which, by the aid of gasolene motors,  long flights have been made.
    Developments by the Wrights.
    In 1900 the Wright brothers, William and Orville, who were then in  the bicycle business in Dayton, Ohio, became interested in Chanute's  experiments and communicated with him.
 The result was that the Wrights  took up Chanute's ideas and developed them further, making many  additions of their own, one of which was the placing of a rudder in  front, and the location of the operator horizontally on the machine,  thus diminishing by four-fifths the wind resistance of the man's  body.
 For three years the Wrights experimented with the glider before  venturing to add a motor, which was not done until they had thoroughly  mastered the control of their movements in the air.
    Limits of the Flying Machine.
    In the opinion of competent experts it is idle to look for a commercial  future for the flying machine.
 There is, and always will be, a limit to  its carrying capacity which will prohibit its employment for passenger  or freight purposes in a wholesale or general way.
 There are some, of  course, who will argue that because a machine will carry two people  another may be constructed that will carry a dozen, but those who make  this contention do not understand the theory of weight sustentation in  the air; or that the greater the load the greater must be the lifting  power (motors and plane surface), and that there is a limit to these--as  will be explained later on--beyond which the aviator cannot go.
    Some Practical Uses.
    At the same time there are fields in which the flying machine may be  used to great advantage.
 These are:    Sports--Flying machine races or flights will always be popular by reason  of the element of danger.
 It is a strange, but nevertheless a true  proposition, that it is this element which adds zest to all sporting  events.
    Scientific--For exploration of otherwise inaccessible regions such as  deserts, mountain tops, etc.

 MECHANICAL BIRD ACTION    In order to understand the theory of the modern flying machine one must  also understand bird action and wind action.
 In this connection the  following simple experiment will be of interest:    Take a circular-shaped bit of cardboard, like the lid of a hat box, and  remove the bent-over portion so as to have a perfectly flat surface with  a clean, sharp edge.
 Holding the cardboard at arm's length, withdraw  your hand, leaving the cardboard without support.
 What is the result?  The cardboard, being heavier than air, and having nothing to sustain  it, will fall to the ground.
 Pick it up and throw it, with considerable  force, against the wind edgewise.
 What happens? Instead of falling to  the ground, the cardboard sails along on the wind, remaining afloat so  long as it is in motion.
 It seeks the ground, by gravity, only as the  motion ceases, and then by easy stages, instead of dropping abruptly as  in the first instance.
    Here we have a homely, but accurate illustration of the action of the  flying machine.
 The motor does for the latter what the force of your arm  does for the cardboard--imparts a motion which keeps it afloat.
 The only  real difference is that the motion given by the motor is continuous and  much more powerful than that given by your arm.
 The action of the latter  is limited and the end of its propulsive force is reached within a  second or two after it is exerted, while the action of the motor is  prolonged.
    Another Simple Illustration.
    Another simple means of illustrating the principle of flying machine  operation, so far as sustentation and the elevation and depression of  the planes is concerned, is explained in the accompanying diagram.
    A is a piece of cardboard about 2 by 3 inches in size.
 B is a piece of  paper of the same size pasted to one edge of A.
 If you bend the paper  to a curve, with convex side up and blow across it as shown in Figure  C, the paper will rise instead of being depressed.
 The dotted lines show  that the air is passing over the top of the curved paper and yet, no  matter how hard you may blow, the effect will be to elevate the paper,  despite the fact that the air is passing over, instead of under the  curved surface.
    In Figure D we have an opposite effect.
 Here the paper is in a curve  exactly the reverse of that shown in Figure C, bringing the concave side  up.
 Now if you will again blow across the surface of the card the action  of the paper will be downward--it will be impossible to make it rise.
  The harder you blow the greater will be the downward movement.
    Principle In General Use.
    This principle is taken advantage of in the construction of all  successful flying machines.
 Makers of monoplanes and biplanes alike  adhere to curved bodies, with the concave surface facing downward.
  Straight planes were tried for a time, but found greatly lacking in the  power of sustentation.
 By curving the planes, and placing the concave  surface downward, a sort of inverted bowl is formed in which the air  gathers and exerts a buoyant effect.
 Just what the ratio of the curve  should be is a matter of contention.
 In some instances one inch to the  foot is found to be satisfactory; in others this is doubled, and there  are a few cases in which a curve of as much as 3 inches to the foot has  been used.
    Right here it might be well to explain that the word "plane" applied to  flying machines of modern construction is in reality a misnomer.
 Plane  indicates a flat, level surface.
 As most successful flying machines have  curved supporting surfaces it is clearly wrong to speak of "planes," or  "aeroplanes.
" Usage, however, has made the terms convenient and, as they  are generally accepted and understood by the public, they are used in  like manner in this volume.
    Getting Under Headway.
    A bird, on first rising from the ground, or beginning its flight from  a tree, will flap its wings to get under headway.
 Here again we have  another illustration of the manner in which a flying machine gets under  headway--the motor imparts the force necessary to put the machine into  the air, but right here the similarity ceases.
 If the machine is to be  kept afloat the motor must be kept moving.
 A flying machine will not  sustain itself; it will not remain suspended in the air unless it is  under headway.
 This is because it is heavier than air, and gravity draws  it to the ground.
    Puzzle in Bird Soaring.
    But a bird, which is also heavier than air, will remain suspended, in a  calm, will even soar and move in a circle, without apparent movement  of its wings.
 This is explained on the theory that there are generally  vertical columns of air in circulation strong enough to sustain a bird,  but much too weak to exert any lifting power on a flying machine, It is  easy to understand how a bird can remain suspended when the wind is  in action, but its suspension in a seeming dead calm was a puzzle  to scientists until Mr. Chanute advanced the proposition of vertical  columns of air.
    Modeled Closely After Birds.
    So far as possible, builders of flying machines have taken what may  be called "the architecture" of birds as a model.
 This is readily  noticeable in the form of construction.
 When a bird is in motion its  wings (except when flapping) are extended in a straight line at right  angles to its body.
 This brings a sharp, thin edge against the air,  offering the least possible surface for resistance, while at the same  time a broad surface for support is afforded by the flat, under side of  the wings.
 Identically the same thing is done in the construction of the  flying machine.
    Note, for instance, the marked similarity in form as shown in the  illustration in .
 Here A is the bird, and B the general  outline of the machine.
 The thin edge of the plane in the latter is  almost a duplicate of that formed by the outstretched wings of the bird,  while the rudder plane in the rear serves the same purpose as the bird's  tail.
        .
 VARIOUS FORMS OF FLYING MACHINES.
    There are three distinct and radically different forms of flying  machines.
 These are:    Aeroplanes, helicopters and ornithopers.
    Of these the aeroplane takes precedence and is used almost exclusively  by successful aviators, the helicopters and ornithopers having been  tried and found lacking in some vital features, while at the same  time in some respects the helicopter has advantages not found in the  aeroplane.
    What the Helicopter Is.
    The helicopter gets its name from being fitted with vertical propellers  or helices (see illustration) by the action of which the machine is  raised directly from the ground into the air.
 This does away with the  necessity for getting the machine under a gliding headway before  it floats, as is the case with the aeroplane, and consequently the  helicopter can be handled in a much smaller space than is required for  an aeroplane.
 This, in many instances, is an important advantage, but it  is the only one the helicopter possesses, and is more than overcome  by its drawbacks.
 The most serious of these is that the helicopter is  deficient in sustaining capacity, and requires too much motive power.
    Form of the Ornithopter.
    The ornithopter has hinged planes which work like the wings of a bird.
  At first thought this would seem to be the correct principle, and most  of the early experimenters conducted their operations on this line.
 It  is now generally understood, however, that the bird in soaring is in  reality an aeroplane, its extended wings serving to sustain, as well as  propel, the body.
 At any rate the ornithoper has not been successful in  aviation, and has been interesting mainly as an ingenious toy.
 Attempts  to construct it on a scale that would permit of its use by man in actual  aerial flights have been far from encouraging.
    Three Kinds of Aeroplanes.
    There are three forms of aeroplanes, with all of which more or less  success has been attained.
 These are:    The monoplane, a one-surfaced plane, like that used by Bleriot.
    The biplane, a two-surfaced plane, now used by the Wrights, Curtiss,  Farman, and others.
    The triplane, a three-surfaced plane This form is but little used,  its only prominent advocate at present being Elle Lavimer, a Danish  experimenter, who has not thus far accomplished much.
    Whatever of real success has been accomplished in aviation may be  credited to the monoplane and biplane, with the balance in favor of  the latter.
 The monoplane is the more simple in construction and, where  weight-sustaining capacity is not a prime requisite, may probably be  found the most convenient.
 This opinion is based on the fact that the  smaller the surface of the plane the less will be the resistance offered  to the air, and the greater will be the speed at which the machine  may be moved.
 On the other hand, the biplane has a much greater plane  surface (double that of a monoplane of the same size) and consequently  much greater weight-carrying capacity.
    Differences in Biplanes.
    While all biplanes are of the same general construction so far as the  main planes are concerned, each aviator has his own ideas as to the  "rigging.
"    Wright, for instance, places a double horizontal rudder in front, with  a vertical rudder in the rear.
 There are no partitions between the  main planes, and the bicycle wheels used on other forms are replaced by  skids.
    Voisin, on the contrary, divides the main planes with vertical  partitions to increase stability in turning; uses a single-plane  horizontal rudder in front, and a big box-tail with vertical rudder at  the rear; also the bicycle wheels.
    Curtiss attaches horizontal stabilizing surfaces to the upper plane;  has a double horizontal rudder in front, with a vertical rudder  and horizontal stabilizing surfaces in rear.
 Also the bicycle wheel  alighting gear.
        .
 CONSTRUCTING A GLIDING MACHINE.
    First decide upon the kind of a machine you want--monoplane, biplane,  or triplane.
 For a novice the biplane will, as a rule, be found the  most satisfactory as it is more compact and therefore the more easily  handled.
 This will be easily understood when we realize that the surface  of a flying machine should be laid out in proportion to the amount of  weight it will have to sustain.
 The generally accepted rule is that 152  square feet of surface will sustain the weight of an average-sized man,  say 170 pounds.
 Now it follows that if these 152 square feet of surface  are used in one plane, as in the monoplane, the length and width of this  plane must be greater than if the same amount of surface is secured by  using two planes--the biplane.
 This results in the biplane being more  compact and therefore more readily manipulated than the monoplane, which  is an important item for a novice.
    Glider the Basis of Success.
    Flying machines without motors are called gliders.
 In making a flying  machine you first construct the glider.
 If you use it in this form it  remains a glider.
 If you install a motor it becomes a flying machine.
  You must have a good glider as the basis of a successful flying machine.
    It will be well for the novice, the man who has never had any experience  as an aviator, to begin with a glider and master its construction and  operation before he essays the more pretentious task of handling a  fully-equipped flying machine.
 In fact, it is essential that he should  do so.
    Plans for Handy Glider.
    A glider with a spread (advancing edge) of 20 feet, and a breadth or  depth of 4 feet, will be about right to begin with.
 Two planes of this  size will give the 152 square yards of surface necessary to sustain a  man's weight.
 Remember that in referring to flying machine measurements  "spread" takes the place of what would ordinarily be called "length,"  and invariably applies to the long or advancing edge of the machine  which cuts into the air.
 Thus, a glider is spoken of as being 20 feet  spread, and 4 feet in depth.
 So far as mastering the control of the  machine is concerned, learning to balance one's self in the air, guiding  the machine in any desired direction by changing the position of the  body, etc.
, all this may be learned just as readily, and perhaps more  so, with a 20-foot glider than with a larger apparatus.
    Kind of Material Required.
    There are three all-important features in flying machine construction,  viz.
: lightness, strength and extreme rigidity.
 Spruce is the wood  generally used for glider frames.
 Oak, ash and hickory are all stronger,  but they are also considerably heavier, and where the saving of weight  is essential, the difference is largely in favor of spruce.
 This will be  seen in the following table:                       Weight       Tensile          Compressive                  per cubic ft.
   Strength           Strength        Wood         in lbs.

     Hickory           53           12,000          8,500     Oak               50           12,000          9,000     Ash               38           12,000          6,000     Walnut            38            8,000          6,000     Spruce            25            8,000          5,000     Pine              25            5,000          4,500      Considering the marked saving in weight spruce has a greater percentage  of tensile strength than any of the other woods.
 It is also easier to  find in long, straight-grained pieces free from knots, and it is this  kind only that should be used in flying machine construction.
    You will next need some spools or hanks of No.
 6 linen shoe  thread, metal sockets, a supply of strong piano wire, a quantity of  closely-woven silk or cotton cloth, glue, turnbuckles, varnish, etc.
    Names of the Various Parts.
    The long strips, four in number, which form the front and rear edges of  the upper and lower frames, are called the horizontal beams.
 These are  each 20 feet in length.
 These horizontal beams are connected by upright  strips, 4 feet long, called stanchions.
 There are usually 12 of these,  six on the front edge, and six on the rear.
 They serve to hold the upper  plane away from the lower one.
 Next comes the ribs.
 These are 4 feet in  length (projecting for a foot over the rear beam), and while intended  principally as a support to the cloth covering of the planes, also  tend to hold the frame together in a horizontal position just as the  stanchions do in the vertical.
 There are forty-one of these ribs,  twenty-one on the upper and twenty on the lower plane.
 Then come the  struts, the main pieces which join the horizontal beams.
 All of these  parts are shown in the illustrations, reference to which will make the  meaning of the various names clear.
    Quantity and Cost of Material.
    For the horizontal beams four pieces of spruce, 20 feet long, 1 1/2  inches wide and 3/4 inch thick are necessary.
 These pieces must be  straight-grain, and absolutely free from knots.
 If it is impossible to  obtain clear pieces of this length, shorter ones may be spliced, but  this is not advised as it adds materially to the weight.
 The twelve  stanchions should be 4 feet long and 7/8 inch in diameter and rounded  in form so as to offer as little resistance as possible to the wind.
 The  struts, there are twelve of them, are 3 feet long by 11/4 x 1/2 inch.
  For a 20-foot biplane about 20 yards of stout silk or unbleached muslin,  of standard one yard width, will be needed.
 The forty-one ribs are  each 4 feet long, and 1/2 inch square.
 A roll of No.
 12 piano wire,  twenty-four sockets, a package of small copper tacks, a pot of glue, and  similar accessories will be required.
 The entire cost of this material  should not exceed $20.
 The wood and cloth will be the two largest  items, and these should not cost more than $10.
 This leaves $10 for the  varnish, wire, tacks, glue, and other incidentals.
 This estimate is  made for cost of materials only, it being taken for granted that the  experimenter will construct his own glider.
 Should the services of a  carpenter be required the total cost will probably approximate $60 or  $70.
    Application of the Rudders.
    The figures given also include the expense of rudders, but the details  of these have not been included as the glider is really complete without  them.
 Some of the best flights the writer ever saw were made by Mr. A.
  M.
 Herring in a glider without a rudder, and yet there can be no doubt  that a rudder, properly proportioned and placed, especially a rear  rudder, is of great value to the aviator as it keeps the machine with  its head to the wind, which is the only safe position for a novice.
 For  initial educational purposes, however, a rudder is not essential as the  glides will, or should, be made on level ground, in moderate, steady  wind currents, and at a modest elevation.
 The addition of a rudder,  therefore, may well be left until the aviator has become reasonably  expert in the management of his machine.
    Putting the Machine Together.
    Having obtained the necessary material, the first move is to have the  rib pieces steamed and curved.
 This curve may be slight, about 2 inches  for the 4 feet.
 While this is being done the other parts should be  carefully rounded so the square edges will be taken off.
 This may be  done with sand paper.
 Next apply a coat of shellac, and when dry rub  it down thoroughly with fine sand paper.
 When the ribs are curved treat  them in the same way.
    Lay two of the long horizontal frame pieces on the floor 3 feet apart.
  Between these place six of the strut pieces.
 Put one at each end, and  each 4 1/2 feet put another, leaving a 2-foot space in the center.
 This  will give you four struts 4 1/2 feet apart, and two in the center 2 feet  apart, as shown in the illustration.
 This makes five rectangles.
 Be sure  that the points of contact are perfect, and that the struts are exactly  at right angles with the horizontal frames.
 This is a most important  feature because if your frame "skews" or twists you cannot keep it  straight in the air.
 Now glue the ends of the struts to the frame  pieces, using plenty of glue, and nail on strips that will hold the  frame in place while the glue is drying.
 The next day lash the joints  together firmly with the shoe thread, winding it as you would to mend a  broken gun stock, and over each layer put a coating of glue.
 This done,  the other frame pieces and struts may be treated in the same way, and  you will thus get the foundations for the two planes.
    Another Way of Placing Struts.
    In the machines built for professional use a stronger and more certain  form of construction is desired.
 This is secured by the placing the  struts for the lower plane under the frame piece, and those for the  upper plane over it, allowing them in each instance to come out flush  with the outer edges of the frame pieces.
 They are then securely  fastened with a tie plate or clamp which passes over the end of the  strut and is bound firmly against the surface of the frame piece by the  eye bolts of the stanchion sockets.
    Placing the Rib Pieces.
    Take one of the frames and place on it the ribs, with the arched side  up, letting one end of the ribs come flush with the front edge of the  forward frame, and the other end projecting about a foot beyond the rear  frame.
 The manner of fastening the ribs to the frame pieces is optional.
  In some cases they are lashed with shoe thread, and in others clamped  with a metal clamp fastened with 1/2-inch wood screws.
 Where clamps and  screws are used care should be taken to make slight holes in the wood  with an awl before starting the screws so as to lessen any tendency to  split the wood.
 On the top frame, twenty-one ribs placed one foot apart  will be required.
 On the lower frame, because of the opening left for  the operator's body, you will need only twenty.
    Joining the Two Frames.
    The two frames must now be joined together.
 For this you will need  twenty-four aluminum or iron sockets which may be purchased at a  foundry or hardware shop.
 These sockets, as the name implies, provide  a receptacle in which the end of a stanchion is firmly held, and have  flanges with holes for eye-bolts which hold them firmly to the frame  pieces, and also serve to hold the guy wires.
 In addition to these  eye-bolt holes there are two others through which screws are fastened  into the frame pieces.
 On the front frame piece of the bottom plane  place six sockets, beginning at the end of the frame, and locating them  exactly opposite the struts.
 Screw the sockets into position with wood  screws, and then put the eye-bolts in place.
 Repeat the operation on the  rear frame.
 Next put the sockets for the upper plane frame in place.
    You are now ready to bring the two planes together.
 Begin by inserting  the stanchions in the sockets in the lower plane.
 The ends may need a  little rubbing with sandpaper to get them into the sockets, but care  must be taken to have them fit snugly.
 When all the stanchions are in  place on the lower plane, lift the upper plane into position, and fit  the sockets over the upper ends of the stanchions.
    Trussing with Guy Wires.
    The next move is to "tie" the frame together rigidly by the aid of guy  wires.
 This is where the No.
 12 piano wire comes in.
 Each rectangle  formed by the struts and stanchions with the exception of the small  center one, is to be wired separately as shown in the illustration.
 At  each of the eight corners forming the rectangle the ring of one of the  eye-bolts will be found.
 There are two ways of doing this "tieing," or  trussing.
 One is to run the wires diagonally from eye-bolt to eye-bolt,  depending upon main strength to pull them taut enough, and then twist  the ends so as to hold.
 The other is to first make a loop of wire  at each eye-bolt, and connect these loops to the main wires with  turn-buckles.
 This latter method is the best, as it admits of the  tension being regulated by simply turning the buckle so as to draw the  ends of the wire closer together.
 A glance at the illustration will make  this plain, and also show how the wires are to be placed.
 The proper  degree of tension may be determined in the following manner:    After the frame is wired place each end on a saw-horse so as to lift the  entire frame clear of the work-shop floor.
 Get under it, in the center  rectangle and, grasping the center struts, one in each hand, put your  entire weight on the structure.
 If it is properly put together it will  remain rigid and unyielding.
 Should it sag ever so slightly the tension  of the wires must be increased until any tendency to sag, no matter how  slight it may be, is overcome.
    Putting on the Cloth.
    We are now ready to put on the cloth covering which holds the air and  makes the machine buoyant.
 The kind of material employed is of small  account so long as it is light, strong, and wind-proof, or nearly so.
  Some aviators use what is called rubberized silk, others prefer balloon  cloth.
 Ordinary muslin of good quality, treated with a coat of light  varnish after it is in place, will answer all the purposes of the  amateur.
    Cut the cloth into strips a little over 4 feet in length.
 As you have  20 feet in width to cover, and the cloth is one yard wide, you will need  seven strips for each plane, so as to allow for laps, etc.
 This will  give you fourteen strips.
 Glue the end of each strip around the front  horizontal beams of the planes, and draw each strip back, over the ribs,  tacking the edges to the ribs as you go along, with small copper or  brass tacks.
 In doing this keep the cloth smooth and stretched tight.
  Tacks should also be used in addition to the glue, to hold the cloth to  the horizontal beams.
    Next, give the cloth a coat of varnish on the clear, or upper side, and  when this is dry your glider will be ready for use.
    Reinforcing the Cloth.
    While not absolutely necessary for amateur purposes, reinforcement  of the cloth, so as to avoid any tendency to split or tear out from  wind-pressure, is desirable.
 One way of doing this is to tack narrow  strips of some heavier material, like felt, over the cloth where it laps  on the ribs.
 Another is to sew slips or pockets in the cloth itself and  let the ribs run through them.
 Still another method is to sew 2-inch  strips (of the same material as the cover) on the cloth, placing them  about one yard apart, but having them come in the center of each piece  of covering, and not on the laps where the various pieces are joined.
    Use of Armpieces.
    Should armpieces be desired, aside from those afforded by the center  struts, take two pieces of spruce, 3 feet long, by 1 x 1 3/4 inches, and  bolt them to the front and rear beams of the lower plane about 14 inches  apart.
 These will be more comfortable than using the struts, as the  operator will not have to spread his arms so much.
 In using the struts  the operator, as a rule, takes hold of them with his hands, while with  the armpieces, as the name implies, he places his arms over them, one of  the strips coming under each armpit.
    Frequently somebody asks why the ribs should be curved.
 The answer is  easy.
 The curvature tends to direct the air downward toward the rear  and, as the air is thus forced downward, there is more or less of an  impact which assists in propelling the aeroplane upwards.
        .
 LEARNING TO FLY.
    Don't be too ambitious at the start.
 Go slow, and avoid unnecessary  risks.
 At its best there is an element of danger in aviation which  cannot be entirely eliminated, but it may be greatly reduced and  minimized by the use of common sense.
    Theoretically, the proper way to begin a glide is from the top of an  incline, facing against the wind, so that the machine will soar until  the attraction of gravitation draws it gradually to the ground.
 This is  the manner in which experienced aviators operate, but it must be kept in  mind that these men are experts.
 They understand air currents, know how  to control the action and direction of their machines by shifting the  position of their bodies, and by so doing avoid accidents which would be  unavoidable by a novice.
    Begin on Level Ground.
    Make your first flights on level ground, having a couple of men to  assist you in getting the apparatus under headway.
 Take your position in  the center rectangle, back far enough to give the forward edges of the  glider an inclination to tilt upward very slightly.
 Now start and run  forward at a moderately rapid gait, one man at each end of the glider  assisting you.
 As the glider cuts into the air the wind will catch under  the uplifted edges of the curved planes, and buoy it up so that it will  rise in the air and take you with it.
 This rise will not be great, just  enough to keep you well clear of the ground.
 Now project your legs a  little to the front so as to shift the center of gravity a trifle and  bring the edges of the glider on an exact level with the atmosphere.
  This, with the momentum acquired in the start, will keep the machine  moving forward for some distance.
    Effect of Body Movements.
    When the weight of the body is slightly back of the center of gravity  the edges of the advancing planes are tilted slightly upward.
 The glider  in this position acts as a scoop, taking in the air which, in turn,  lifts it off the ground.
 When a certain altitude is reached--this varies  with the force of the wind--the tendency to a forward movement is  lost and the glider comes to the ground.
 It is to prolong the forward  movement as much as possible that the operator shifts the center of  gravity slightly, bringing the apparatus on an even keel as it were by  lowering the advancing edges.
 This done, so long as there is momentum  enough to keep the glider moving, it will remain afloat.
    If you shift your body well forward it will bring the front edges of  the glider down, and elevate the rear ones.
 In this way the air will be  "spilled" out at the rear, and, having lost the air support or buoyancy,  the glider comes down to the ground.
 A few flights will make any  ordinary man proficient in the control of his apparatus by his body  movements, not only as concerns the elevating and depressing of the  advancing edges, but also actual steering.
 You will quickly learn,  for instance, that, as the shifting of the bodily weight backwards  and forwards affects the upward and downward trend of the planes, so a  movement sideways--to the left or the right--affects the direction in  which the glider travels.
    Ascends at an Angle.
    In ascending, the glider and flying machine, like the bird, makes an  angular, not a vertical flight.
 Just what this angle of ascension may be  is difficult to determine.
 It is probable and in fact altogether likely,  that it varies with the force of the wind, weight of the rising body,  power of propulsion, etc.
 This, in the language of physicists, is the  angle of inclination, and, as a general thing, under normal conditions  (still air) should be put down as about one in ten, or 5 3/4 degrees.
  This would be an ideal condition, but it has not, as vet been reached.
  The force of the wind affects the angle considerably, as does also the  weight and velocity of the apparatus.
 In general practice the angle  varies from 23 to 45 degrees.
 At more than 45 degrees the supporting  effort is overcome by the resistance to forward motion.
    Increasing the speed or propulsive force, tends to lessen the angle at  which the machine may be successfully operated because it reduces the  wind pressure.
 Most of the modern flying machines are operated at an  angle of 23 degrees, or less.
    Maintaining an Equilibrium.
    Stable equilibrium is one of the main essentials to successful flight,  and this cannot be preserved in an uncertain, gusty wind, especially by  an amateur.
 The novice should not attempt a glide unless the conditions  are just right.
 These conditions are: A clear, level space, without  obstructions, such as trees, etc.
, and a steady wind of not exceeding  twelve miles an hour.
 Always fly against the wind.
    When a reasonable amount of proficiency in the handling of the machine  on level ground has been acquired the field of practice may be changed  to some gentle slope.
 In starting from a slope it will be found easier  to keep the machine afloat, but the experience at first is likely to be  very disconcerting to a man of less than iron nerve.
 As the glider sails  away from the top of the slope the distance between him and the ground  increases rapidly until the aviator thinks he is up a hundred miles  in the air.
 If he will keep cool, manipulate his apparatus so as to  preserve its equilibrium, and "let nature take its course," he will come  down gradually and safely to the ground at a considerable distance  from the starting place.
 This is one advantage of starting from an  elevation--your machine will go further.
    But, if the aviator becomes "rattled"; if he loses control of his  machine, serious results, including a bad fall with risk of death,  are almost certain.
 And yet this practice is just as necessary as the  initial lessons on level ground.
 When judgment is used, and "haste made  slowly," there is very little real danger.
 While experimenting with  gliders the Wrights made flights innumerable under all sorts of  conditions and never had an accident of any kind.
    Effects of Wind Currents.
    The larger the machine the more difficult it will be to control its  movements in the air, and yet enlargement is absolutely necessary as  weight, in the form of motor, rudder, etc.
, is added.
    Air currents near the surface of the ground are diverted by every  obstruction unless the wind is blowing hard enough to remove the  obstruction entirely.
 Take, for instance, the case of a tree or shrub,  in a moderate wind of from ten to twelve miles an hour.
 As the wind  strikes the tree it divides, part going to one side and part going to  the other, while still another part is directed upward and goes over  the top of the obstruction.
 This makes the handling of a glider on  an obstructed field difficult and uncertain.
 To handle a glider  successfully the place of operation should be clear and the wind  moderate and steady.
 If it is gusty postpone your flight.
 In this  connection it will be well to understand the velocity of the wind, and  what it means as shown in the following table:         Miles per hour Feet per second     Pressure per sq.
 foot            10                14.

6               49.
200    Pressure of wind increases in proportion to the square of the velocity.
  Thus wind at 10 miles an hour has four times the pressure of wind at  5 miles an hour.
 The greater this pressure the large and heavier the  object which can be raised.
 Any boy who has had experience in flying  kites can testify to this, High winds, however, are almost invariably  gusty and uncertain as to direction, and this makes them dangerous for  aviators.
 It is also a self-evident fact that, beyond a certain stage,  the harder the wind blows the more difficult it is to make headway  against it.
    Launching Device for Gliders.
    On page 195 will be found a diagram of the various parts of a launcher  for gliders, designed and patented by Mr. Octave Chanute.
 In describing  this invention in Aeronautics, Mr. Chanute says:    "In practicing, the track, preferably portable, is generally laid in  the direction of the existing wind and the car, preferably a  light platform-car, is placed on the track.
 The truck carrying  the winding-drum and its motor is placed to windward a suitable  distance--say from two hundred to one thousand feet--and is firmly  blocked or anchored in line with the portable track, which is preferably  80 or 100 feet in length.
 The flying or gliding machine to be launched  with its operator is placed on the platform-car at the leeward end of  the portable track.
 The line, which is preferably a flexible combination  wire-and-cord cable, is stretched between the winding-drum on the track  and detachably secured to the flying or gliding machine, preferably by  means of a trip-hoop, or else held in the hand of the operator, so that  the operator may readily detach the same from the flying-machine when  the desired height is attained.
"    How Glider Is Started.
    "Then upon a signal given by the operator the engineer at the motor  puts it into operation, gradually increasing the speed until the line  is wound upon the drum at a maximum speed of, say, thirty miles an  hour.
 The operator of the flying-machine, whether he stands upright and  carries it on his shoulders, or whether he sits or lies down prone upon  it, adjusts the aeroplane or carrying surfaces so that the wind shall  strike them on the top and press downward instead of upward until the  platform-car under action of the winding-drum and line attains the  required speed.
    "When the operator judges that his speed is sufficient, and this depends  upon the velocity of the wind as well as that of the car moving against  the wind, he quickly causes the front of the flying-machine to tip  upward, so that the relative wind striking on the under side of the  planes or carrying surfaces shall lift the flying machine into the air.
  It then ascends like a kite to such height as may be desired by the  operator, who then trips the hook and releases the line from the  machine.
"    What the Operator Does.
    "The operator being now free in the air has a certain initial velocity  imparted by the winding-drum and line and also a potential energy  corresponding to his height above the ground.
 If the flying or gliding  machine is provided with a motor, he can utilize that in his further  flight, and if it is a simple gliding machine without motor he can make  a descending flight through the air to such distance as corresponds to  the velocity acquired and the height gained, steering meanwhile by the  devices provided for that purpose.
    "The simplest operation or maneuver is to continue the flight straight  ahead against the wind; but it is possible to vary this course to the  right or left, or even to return in downward flight with the wind to  the vicinity of the starting-point.
 Upon nearing the ground the operator  tips upward his carrying-surfaces and stops his headway upon the  cushion of increased air resistance so caused.
 The operator is in no way  permanently fastened to his machine, and the machine and the operator  simply rest upon the light platform-car, so that the operator is free  to rise with the machine from the car whenever the required initial  velocity is attained.
    Motor For the Launcher.
    "The motor may be of any suitable kind or construction, but is  preferably an electric or gasolene motor.
 The winding-drum is furnished  with any suitable or customary reversing-guide to cause the line to  wind smoothly and evenly upon the drum.
 The line is preferably a cable  composed of flexible wire and having a cotton or other cord core to  increase its flexibility.
 The line extends from the drum to the flying  or gliding machine.
 Its free end may, if desired, be grasped and held  by the operator until the flying-machine ascends to the desired height,  when by simply letting go of the line the operator may continue his  flight free.
 The line, however, is preferably connected to the flying  or gliding machine directly by a trip-hook having a handle or trip lever  within reach of the operator, so that when he ascends to the required  height he may readily detach the line from the flying or gliding  machine.
"        .
 PUTTING ON THE RUDDER.
    Gliders as a rule have only one rudder, and this is in the rear.
 It  tends to keep the apparatus with its head to the wind.
 Unlike the rudder  on a boat it is fixed and immovable.
 The real motor-propelled flying  machine, generally has both front and rear rudders manipulated by wire  cables at the will of the operator.
    Allowing that the amateur has become reasonably expert in the  manipulation of the glider he should, before constructing an actual  flying machine, equip his glider with a rudder.
    Cross Pieces for Rudder Beam.
    To do this he should begin by putting in a cross piece, 2 feet long by  1/4 x 3/4 inches between the center struts, in the lower plane.
 This may  be fastened to the struts with bolts or braces.
 The former method is  preferable.
 On this cross piece, and on the rear frame of the plane  itself, the rudder beam is clamped and bolted.
 This rudder beam is 8  feet 11 inches long.
 Having put these in place duplicate them in exactly  the same manner and dimensions from the upper frame The cross pieces on  which the ends of the rudder beams are clamped should be placed about  one foot in advance of the rear frame beam.
    The Rudder Itself.
    The next step is to construct the rudder itself.
 This consists of two  sections, one horizontal, the other vertical.
 The latter keeps  the aeroplane headed into the wind, while the former keeps it  steady--preserves the equilibrium.
    The rudder beams form the top and bottom frames of the vertical rudder.
  To these are bolted and clamped two upright pieces, 3 feet, 10 inches  in length, and 3/4 inch in cross section.
 These latter pieces are placed  about two feet apart.
 This completes the framework of the vertical  rudder.
 See next page (59).
    For the horizontal rudder you will require two strips 6 feet long, and  four 2 feet long.
 Find the exact center of the upright pieces on the  vertical rudder, and at this spot fasten with bolts the long pieces of  the horizontal, placing them on the outside of the vertical strips.
 Next  join the ends of the horizontal strips with the 2-foot pieces, using  small screws and corner braces.
 This done you will have two of the  2-foot pieces left.
 These go in the center of the horizontal frame,  "straddling" the vertical strips, as shown in the illustration.
    The framework is to be covered with cloth in the same manner as the  planes.
 For this about ten yards will be needed.
    Strengthening the Rudder.
    To ensure rigidity the rudder must be stayed with guy wires.
 For this  purpose the No.
 12 piano wire is the best.
 Begin by running two of these  wires from the top eye-bolts of stanchions 3 and 4, page 37, to rudder  beam where it joins the rudder planes, fastening them at the bottom.
  Then run two wires from the top of the rudder beam at the same point,  to the bottom eye-bolts of the same stanchions.
 This will give you  four diagonal wires reaching from the rudder beam to the top and bottom  planes of the glider.
 Now, from the outer ends of the rudder frame run  four similar diagonal wires to the end of the rudder beam where it rests  on the cross piece.
 You will then have eight truss wires strengthening  the connection of the rudder to the main body of the glider.
    The framework of the rudder planes is then to be braced in the same way,  which will take eight more wires, four for each rudder plane.
 All the  wires are to be connected at one end with turn-buckles so the tension  may be regulated as desired.
    In forming the rudder frame it will be well to mortise the corners, tack  them together with small nails, and then put in a corner brace in the  inside of each joint.
 In doing this bear in mind that the material to be  thus fastened is light, and consequently the lightest of nails, screws,  bolts and corner pieces, etc.
, is necessary.
        .
 THE REAL FLYING MACHINE.
    We will now assume that you have become proficient enough to warrant an  attempt at the construction of a real flying machine--one that will not  only remain suspended in the air at the will of the operator, but make  respectable progress in whatever direction he may desire to go.
 The  glider, it must be remembered, is not steerable, except to a limited  extent, and moves only in one direction--against the wind.
 Besides this  its power of flotation--suspension in the air--is circumscribed.
    Larger Surface Area Required.
    The real flying machine is the glider enlarged, and equipped with  motor and propeller.
 The first thing to do is to decide upon the size  required.
 While a glider of 20 foot spread is large enough to sustain a  man it could not under any possible conditions, be made to rise with the  weight of the motor, propeller and similar equipment added.
 As the load  is increased so must the surface area of the planes be increased.
  Just what this increase in surface area should be is problematical as  experienced aviators disagree, but as a general proposition it may be  placed at from three to four times the area of a 20-foot glider.
 [3]    Some Practical Examples.
    The Wrights used a biplane 41 feet in spread, and 6 1/2 ft.
 deep.
 This,  for the two planes, gives a total surface area of 538 square feet,  inclusive of auxiliary planes.
 This sustains the engine equipment,  operator, etc.
, a total weight officially announced at 1,070 pounds.
 It  shows a lifting capacity of about two pounds to the square foot of plane  surface, as against a lifting capacity of about 1/2 pound per square  foot of plane surface for the 20-foot glider.
 This same Wright machine  is also reported to have made a successful flight, carrying a total load  of 1,100 pounds, which would be over two pounds for each square foot of  surface area, which, with auxiliary planes, is 538 square feet.
    To attain the same results in a monoplane, the single surface would  have to be 60 feet in spread and 9 feet deep.
 But, while this is the  mathematical rule, Bleriot has demonstrated that it does not always hold  good.
 On his record-breaking trip across the English channel, July 25th,  1909, the Frenchman was carried in a monoplane 24 1/2 feet in spread,  and with a total sustaining surface of 150 1/2 square feet.
 The total  weight of the outfit, including machine, operator and fuel sufficient  for a three-hour run, was only 660 pounds.
 With an engine of (nominally)  25 horsepower the distance of 21 miles was covered in 37 minutes.
    Which is the Best?    Right here an established mathematical quantity is involved.
 A small  plane surface offers less resistance to the air than a large one and  consequently can attain a higher rate of speed.
 As explained further  on in this chapter speed is an important factor in the matter of  weight-sustaining capacity.
 A machine that travels one-third faster  than another can get along with one-half the surface area of the latter  without affecting the load.
 See the closing paragraph of this chapter on  this point.
 In theory the construction is also the simplest, but this is  not always found to be so in practice.
 The designing and carrying  into execution of plans for an extensive area like that of a monoplane  involves great skill and cleverness in getting a framework that will be  strong enough to furnish the requisite support without an undue excess  of weight.
 This proposition is greatly simplified in the biplane and,  while the speed attained by the latter may not be quite so great as that  of the monoplane, it has much larger weight-carrying capacity.
    Proper Sizes For Frame.
    Allowing that the biplane form is selected the construction may be  practically identical with that of the 20-foot glider described in  .
, except as to size and elimination of the armpieces.
 In  size the surface planes should be about twice as large as those of  the 20-foot glider, viz: 40 feet spread instead of 20, and 6 feet deep  instead of 3.
 The horizontal beams, struts, stanchions, ribs, etc.
,  should also be increased in size proportionately.
    While care in the selection of clear, straight-grained timber is  important in the glider, it is still more important in the construction  of a motor-equipped flying machine as the strain on the various parts  will be much greater.
    How to Splice Timbers.
    It is practically certain that you will have to resort to splicing the  horizontal beams as it will be difficult, if not impossible, to find  40-foot pieces of timber totally free from knots and worm holes, and of  straight grain.
    If splicing is necessary select two good 20-foot pieces, 3 inches wide  and 1 1/2 inches thick, and one 10-foot long, of the same thickness and  width.
 Plane off the bottom sides of the 10-foot strip, beginning about  two feet back from each end, and taper them so the strip will be about  3/4 inch thick at the extreme ends.
 Lay the two 20-foot beams end to  end, and under the joint thus made place the 10-foot strip, with the  planed-off ends downward.
 The joint of the 20-foot pieces should be  directly in the center of the 10-foot piece.
 Bore ten holes (with a  1/4-inch augur) equi-distant apart through the 20-foot strips and the  10-foot strip under them.
 Through these holes run 1/4-inch stove bolts  with round, beveled heads.
 In placing these bolts use washers top and  bottom, one between the head and the top beam, and the other between the  bottom beam and the screw nut which holds the bolt.
 Screw the nuts down  hard so as to bring the two beams tightly together, and you will have a  rigid 40-foot beam.
    Splicing with Metal Sleeves.
    An even better way of making a splice is by tonguing and grooving the  ends of the frame pieces and enclosing them in a metal sleeve, but  it requires more mechanical skill than the method first named.
 The  operation of tonguing and grooving is especially delicate and calls for  extreme nicety of touch in the handling of tools, but if this dexterity  is possessed the job will be much more satisfactory than one done with a  third timber.
    As the frame pieces are generally about 1 1/2 inch in diameter, the  tongue and the groove into which the tongue fits must be correspondingly  small.
 Begin by sawing into one side of one of the frame pieces about  4 inches back from the end.
 Make the cut about 1/2 inch deep.
 Then turn  the piece over and duplicate the cut.
 Next saw down from the end  to these cuts.
 When the sawed-out parts are removed you will have a  "tongue" in the end of the frame timber 4 inches long and 1/2 inch  thick.
 The next move is to saw out a 5/8-inch groove in the end of the  frame piece which is to be joined.
 You will have to use a small chisel  to remove the 5/8-inch bit.
 This will leave a groove into which the  tongue will fit easily.
    Joining the Two Pieces.
    Take a thin metal sleeve--this is merely a hollow tube of aluminum  or brass open at each end--8 inches long, and slip it over either the  tongued or grooved end of one of the frame timbers.
 It is well to have  the sleeve fit snugly, and this may necessitate a sand-papering of the  frame pieces so the sleeve will slip on.
    Push the sleeve well back out of the way.
 Cover the tongue thoroughly  with glue, and also put some on the inside of the groove.
 Use plenty  of glue.
 Now press the tongue into the groove, and keep the ends firmly  together until the glue is thoroughly dried.
 Rub off the joint lightly  with sand-paper to remove any of the glue which may have oozed out, and  slip the sleeve into place over the joint.
 Tack the sleeve in position  with small copper tacks, and you will have an ideal splice.
    The same operation is to be repeated on each of the four frame pieces.
  Two 20-foot pieces joined in this way will give a substantial frame, but  when suitable timber of this kind can not be had, three pieces, each 6  feet 11 inches long, may be used.
 This would give 20 feet 9 inches, of  which 8 inches will be taken up in the two joints, leaving the frame 20  feet 1 inch long.
    Installation of Motor.
    Next comes the installation of the motor.
 The kinds and efficiency of  the various types are described in the following chapter (IX).
 All we  are interested in at this point is the manner of installation.
 This  varies according to the personal ideas of the aviator.
 Thus one man puts  his motor in the front of his machine, another places it in the center,  and still another finds the rear of the frame the best.
 All get  good results, the comparative advantages of which it is difficult  to estimate.
 Where one man, as already explained, flies faster than  another, the one beaten from the speed standpoint has an advantage in  the matter of carrying weight, etc.
    The ideas of various well-known aviators as to the correct placing of  motors may be had from the following:    Wrights--In rear of machine and to one side.
    Curtiss--Well to rear, about midway between upper and lower planes.
    Raich--In rear, above the center.
    Brauner-Smith--In exact center of machine.
    Van Anden--In center.
    Herring-Burgess--Directly behind operator.
    Voisin--In rear, and on lower plane.
    Bleriot--In front.
    R.
 E.
 P.
--In front.
    The One Chief Object.
    An even distribution of the load so as to assist in maintaining the  equilibrium of the machine, should be the one chief object in deciding  upon the location of the motor.
 It matters little what particular spot  is selected so long as the weight does not tend to overbalance the  machine, or to "throw it off an even keel.
" It is just like loading  a vessel, an operation in which the expert seeks to so distribute  the weight of the cargo as to keep the vessel in a perfectly upright  position, and prevent a "list" or leaning to one side.
 The more evenly  the cargo is distributed the more perfect will be the equilibrium of the  vessel and the better it can be handled.
 Sometimes, when not properly  stowed, the cargo shifts, and this at once affects the position of the  craft.
 When a ship "lists" to starboard or port a preponderating weight  of the cargo has shifted sideways; if bow or stern is unduly depressed  it is a sure indication that the cargo has shifted accordingly.
 In  either event the handling of the craft becomes not only difficult, but  extremely hazardous.
 Exactly the same conditions prevail in the handling  of a flying machine.
    Shape of Machine a Factor.
    In placing the motor you must be governed largely by the shape and  construction of the flying machine frame.
 If the bulk of the weight  of the machine and auxiliaries is toward the rear, then the natural  location for the motor will be well to the front so as to counterbalance  the excess in rear weight.
 In the same way if the preponderance of the  weight is forward, then the motor should be placed back of the center.
    As the propeller blade is really an integral part of the motor, the  latter being useless without it, its placing naturally depends upon the  location selected for the motor.
    Rudders and Auxiliary Planes.
    Here again there is great diversity of opinion among aviators as to  size, location and form.
 The striking difference of ideas in this  respect is well illustrated in the choice made by prominent makers as  follows:    Voisin--horizontal rudder, with two wing-like planes, in front; box-like  longitudinal stability plane in rear, inside of which is a vertical  rudder.
    Wright--large biplane horizontal rudder in front at considerable  distance--about 10 feet--from the main planes; vertical biplane rudder  in rear; ends of upper and lower main planes made flexible so they may  be moved.
    Curtiss--horizontal biplane rudder, with vertical damping plane between  the rudder planes about 10 feet in front of main planes; vertical rudder  in rear; stabilizing planes at each end of upper main plane.
    Bleriot--V-shaped stabilizing fin, projecting from rear of plane, with  broad end outward; to the broad end of this fin is hinged a vertical  rudder; horizontal biplane rudder, also in rear, under the fin.
    These instances show forcefully the wide diversity of opinion existing  among experienced aviators as to the best manner of placing the rudders  and stabilizing, or auxiliary planes, and make manifest how hopeless  would be the task of attempting to select any one form and advise its  exclusive use.
    Rudder and Auxiliary Construction.
    The material used in the construction of the rudders and auxiliary  planes is the same as that used in the main planes--spruce for the  framework and some kind of rubberized or varnished cloth for the  covering.
 The frames are joined and wired in exactly the same manner  as the frames of the main planes, the purpose being to secure the same  strength and rigidity.
 Dimensions of the various parts depend upon the  plan adopted and the size of the main plane.
    No details as to exact dimensions of these rudders and auxiliary planes  are obtainable.
 The various builders, while willing enough to supply  data as to the general measurements, weight, power, etc.
, of their  machines, appear to have overlooked the details of the auxiliary parts,  thinking, perhaps, that these were of no particular import to the  general public.
 In the Wright machine, the rear horizontal and front  vertical rudders may be set down as being about one-quarter (probably a  little less) the size of the main supporting planes.
    Arrangement of Alighting Gear.
    Most modern machines are equipped with an alighting gear, which not  only serves to protect the machine and aviator from shock or injury in  touching the ground, but also aids in getting under headway.
 All the  leading makes, with the exception of the Wright, are furnished with a  frame carrying from two to five pneumatic rubber-tired bicycle wheels.
  In the Curtiss and Voisin machines one wheel is placed in front and two  in the rear.
 In the Bleriot and other prominent machines the reverse is  the rule--two wheels in front and one in the rear.
 Farman makes use of  five wheels, one in the extreme rear, and four, arranged in pairs, a  little to the front of the center of the main lower plane.
    In place of wheels the Wright machine is equipped with a skid-like  device consisting of two long beams attached to the lower plane by  stanchions and curving up far in front, so as to act as supports to the  horizontal rudder.
    Why Wood Is Favored.
    A frequently asked question is: "Why is not aluminum, or some similar  metal, substituted for wood.
" Wood, particularly spruce, is preferred  because, weight considered, it is much stronger than aluminum, and this  is the lightest of all metals.
 In this connection the following table  will be of interest:                                                          Compressive                     Weight      Tensile Strength         Strength                 per cubic foot    per sq.

 While aluminum has double the strength  of spruce wood it is vastly heavier, and thus the advantage it has in  strength is overbalanced many times by its weight.
 The specific gravity  of aluminum is 2.
50; that of spruce is only 0.

    Things to Be Considered.
    In laying out plans for a flying machine there are five important points  which should be settled upon before the actual work of construction is  started.
 These are:    First--Approximate weight of the machine when finished and equipped.
    Second--Area of the supporting surface required.
    Third--Amount of power that will be necessary to secure the desired  speed and lifting capacity.
    Fourth--Exact dimensions of the main framework and of the auxiliary  parts.
    Fifth--Size, speed and character of the propeller.
    In deciding upon these it will be well to take into consideration  the experience of expert aviators regarding these features as given  elsewhere.
 (See .
)    Estimating the Weights Involved.
    In fixing upon the probable approximate weight in advance of  construction much, of course, must be assumed.
 This means that it will  be a matter of advance estimating.
 If a two-passenger machine is to be  built we will start by assuming the maximum combined weight of the two  people to be 350 pounds.
 Most of the professional aviators are lighter  than this.
 Taking the medium between the weights of the Curtiss and  Wright machines we have a net average of 850 pounds for the framework,  motor, propeller, etc.
 This, with the two passengers, amounts to 1,190  pounds.
 As the machines quoted are in successful operation it will be  reasonable to assume that this will be a safe basis to operate on.
    What the Novice Must Avoid.
    This does not mean, however, that it will be safe to follow these  weights exactly in construction, but that they will serve merely as  a basis to start from.
 Because an expert can turn out a machine,  thoroughly equipped, of 850 pounds weight, it does not follow that a  novice can do the same thing.
 The expert's work is the result of years  of experience, and he has learned how to construct frames and motor  plants of the utmost lightness and strength.
    It will be safer for the novice to assume that he can not duplicate the  work of such men as Wright and Curtiss without adding materially to the  gross weight of the framework and equipment minus passengers.
    How to Distribute the Weight.
    Let us take 1,030 pounds as the net weight of the machine as against the  same average in the Wright and Curtiss machines.
 Now comes the question  of distributing this weight between the framework, motor, and other  equipment.
 As a general proposition the framework should weigh about  twice as much as the complete power plant (this is for amateur work).
    The word "framework" indicates not only the wooden frames of the main  planes, auxiliary planes, rudders, etc.
, but the cloth coverings as  well--everything in fact except the engine and propeller.
    On the basis named the framework would weigh 686 pounds, and the power  plant 344.
 These figures are liberal, and the results desired may be  obtained well within them as the novice will learn as he makes progress  in the work.
    Figuring on Surface Area.
    It was Prof.
 Langley who first brought into prominence in connection  with flying machine construction the mathematical principle that the  larger the object the smaller may be the relative area of support.
 As  explained in , there are mechanical limits as to size which  it is not practical to exceed, but the main principle remains in effect.
    Take two aeroplanes of marked difference in area of surface.
 The larger  will, as a rule, sustain a greater weight in relative proportion to  its area than the smaller one, and do the work with less relative  horsepower.
 As a general thing well-constructed machines will average  a supporting capacity of one pound for every one-half square foot of  surface area.
 Accepting this as a working rule we find that to sustain  a weight of 1,200 pounds--machine and two passengers--we should have 600  square feet of surface.
    Distributing the Surface Area.
    The largest surfaces now in use are those of the Wright, Voisin and  Antoinette machines--538 square feet in each.
 The actual sustaining  power of these machines, so far as known, has never been tested to the  limit; it is probable that the maximum is considerably in excess of what  they have been called upon to show.
 In actual practice the average is a  little over one pound for each one-half square foot of surface area.
    Allowing that 600 square feet of surface will be used, the next question  is how to distribute it to the best advantage.
 This is another important  matter in which individual preference must rule.
 We have seen how the  professionals disagree on this point, some using auxiliary planes  of large size, and others depending upon smaller auxiliaries with an  increase in number so as to secure on a different plan virtually the  same amount of surface.
    In deciding upon this feature the best thing to do is to follow the  plans of some successful aviator, increasing the area of the auxiliaries  in proportion to the increase in the area of the main planes.
 Thus, if  you use 600 square feet of surface where the man whose plans you  are following uses 500, it is simply a matter of making your planes  one-fifth larger all around.
    The Cost of Production.
    Cost of production will be of interest to the amateur who essays to  construct a flying machine.
 Assuming that the size decided upon is  double that of the glider the material for the framework, timber, cloth,  wire, etc.
, will cost a little more than double.
 This is because it must  be heavier in proportion to the increased size of the framework, and  heavy material brings a larger price than the lighter goods.
 If we allow  $20 as the cost of the glider material it will be safe to put down  the cost of that required for a real flying machine framework at $60,  provided the owner builds it himself.
    As regards the cost of motor and similar equipment it can only be said  that this depends upon the selection made.
 There are some reliable  aviation motors which may be had as low as $500, and there are others  which cost as much as $2,000.
    Services of Expert Necessary.
    No matter what kind of a motor may be selected the services of an expert  will be necessary in its proper installation unless the amateur has  considerable genius in this line himself.
 As a general thing $25 should  be a liberal allowance for this work.
 No matter how carefully the engine  may be placed and connected it will be largely a matter of luck if it is  installed in exactly the proper manner at the first attempt.
 The chances  are that several alterations, prompted by the results of trials, will  have to be made.
 If this is the case the expert's bill may readily run  up to $50.
 If the amateur is competent to do this part of the work the  entire item of $50 may, of course, be cut out.
    As a general proposition a fairly satisfactory flying machine, one that  will actually fly and carry the operator with it, may be constructed for  $750, but it will lack the better qualities which mark the higher priced  machines.
 This computation is made on the basis of $60 for material, $50  for services of expert, $600 for motor, etc.
, and an allowance of $40  for extras.
    No man who has the flying machine germ in his system will be long  satisfied with his first moderate price machine, no matter how well it  may work.
 It's the old story of the automobile "bug" over again.
 The man  who starts in with a modest $1,000 automobile invariably progresses by  easy stages to the $4,000 or $5,000 class.
 The natural tendency is to  want the biggest and best attainable within the financial reach of the  owner.
    It's exactly the same way with the flying machine convert.
 The more  proficient he becomes in the manipulation of his car, the stronger  becomes the desire to fly further and stay in the air longer than the  rest of his brethren.
 This necessitates larger, more powerful, and more  expensive machines as the work of the germ progresses.
    Speed Affects Weight Capacity.
    Don't overlook the fact that the greater speed you can attain the  smaller will be the surface area you can get along with.
 If a machine  with 500 square feet of sustaining surface, traveling at a speed of  40 miles an hour, will carry a weight of 1,200 pounds, we can cut the  sustaining surface in half and get along with 250 square feet, provided  a speed of 60 miles an hour can be obtained.
 At 100 miles an hour only  80 square feet of surface area would be required.
 In both instances the  weight sustaining capacity will remain the same as with the 500 square  feet of surface area--1,200 pounds.
    One of these days some mathematical genius will figure out this problem  with exactitude and we will have a dependable table giving the maximum  carrying capacity of various surface areas at various stated speeds,  based on the dimensions of the advancing edges.
 At present it is largely  a matter of guesswork so far as making accurate computation goes.
  Much depends upon the shape of the machine, and the amount of surface  offering resistance to the wind, etc.
        .
 SELECTION OF THE MOTOR.
    Motors for flying machines must be light in weight, of great strength,  productive of extreme speed, and positively dependable in action.
  It matters little as to the particular form, or whether air or water  cooled, so long as the four features named are secured.
 There are at  least a dozen such motors or engines now in use.
 All are of the gasolene  type, and all possess in greater or lesser degree the desired qualities.
  Some of these motors are:    Renault--8-cylinder, air-cooled; 50 horse power; weight 374 pounds.
    Fiat--8-cylinder, air-cooled; 50 horse power; weight 150 pounds.
    Farcot--8-cylinder, air-cooled; from 30 to 100 horse power, according to  bore of cylinders; weight of smallest, 84 pounds.

--10-cylinder, air-cooled; 150 horse power; weight 215 pounds.
    Gnome--7 and 14 cylinders, revolving type, air-cooled; 50 and 100 horse  power; weight 150 and 300 pounds.
    Darracq--2 to 14 cylinders, water cooled; 30 to 200 horse power; weight  of smallest 100 pounds.
    Wright--4-cylinder, water-cooled; 25 horse power; weight 200 pounds.
    Antoinette--8 and 16-cylinder, water-cooled; 50 and 100 horse power;  weight 250 and 500 pounds.
    E.

--8-cylinder, water-cooled; from 30 to 80 horse power, according  to bore of cylinder; weight 150 to 400 pounds.
    Curtiss--8-cylinder, water-cooled; 60 horse power; weight 300 pounds.
    Average Weight Per Horse Power.
    It will be noticed that the Gnome motor is unusually light, being about  three pounds to the horse power produced, as opposed to an average of 4  1/2 pounds per horse power in other makes.
 This result is secured by  the elimination of the fly-wheel, the engine itself revolving, thus  obtaining the same effect that would be produced by a fly-wheel.
 The  Farcot is even lighter, being considerably less than three pounds per  horse power, which is the nearest approach to the long-sought engine  equipment that will make possible a complete flying machine the total  weight of which will not exceed one pound per square foot of area.
    How Lightness Is Secured.
    Thus far foreign manufacturers are ahead of Americans in the production  of light-weight aerial motors, as is evidenced by the Gnome and Farcot  engines, both of which are of French make.
 Extreme lightness is made  possible by the use of fine, specially prepared steel for the cylinders,  thus permitting them to be much thinner than if ordinary forms of steel  were used.
 Another big saving in weight is made by substituting what are  known as "auto lubricating" alloys for bearings.
 These alloys are made  of a combination of aluminum and magnesium.
    Still further gains are made in the use of alloy steel tubing instead of  solid rods, and also by the paring away of material wherever it can be  done without sacrificing strength.
 This plan, with the exclusive use of  the best grades of steel, regardless of cost, makes possible a marked  reduction in weight.
    Multiplicity of Cylinders.
    Strange as it may seem, multiplicity of cylinders does not always add  proportionate weight.
 Because a 4-cylinder motor weighs say 100 pounds,  it does not necessarily follow that an 8-cylinder equipment will weigh  200 pounds.
 The reason of this will be plain when it is understood  that many of the parts essential to a 4-cylinder motor will fill the  requirements of an 8-cylinder motor without enlargement or addition.
    Neither does multiplying the cylinders always increase the horsepower  proportionately.
 If a 4-cylinder motor is rated at 25 horsepower it is  not safe to take it for granted that double the number of cylinders  will give 50 horsepower.
 Generally speaking, eight cylinders, the bore,  stroke and speed being the same, will give double the power that can be  obtained from four, but this does not always hold good.
 Just why this  exception should occur is not explainable by any accepted rule.
    Horse Power and Speed.
    Speed is an important requisite in a flying-machine motor, as the  velocity of the aeroplane is a vital factor in flotation.
 At  first thought, the propeller and similar adjuncts being equal, the  inexperienced mind would naturally argue that a 50-horsepower engine  should produce just double the speed of one of 25-horsepower.
 That  this is a fallacy is shown by actual performances.
 The Wrights, using a  25-horsepower motor, have made 44 miles an hour, while Bleriot, with a  50-horsepower motor, has a record of a short-distance flight at the rate  of 52 miles an hour.
 The fact is that, so far as speed is concerned,  much depends upon the velocity of the wind, the size and shape of the  aeroplane itself, and the size, shape and gearing of the propeller.
 The  stronger the wind is blowing the easier it will be for the aeroplane  to ascend, but at the same time the more difficult it will be to make  headway against the wind in a horizontal direction.
 With a strong head  wind, and proper engine force, your machine will progress to a certain  extent, but it will be at an angle.
 If the aviator desired to keep  on going upward this would be all right, but there is a limit to the  altitude which it is desirable to reach--from 100 to 500 feet for  experts--and after that it becomes a question of going straight ahead.
    Great Waste of Power.
    One thing is certain--even in the most efficient of modern aerial motors  there is a great loss of power between the two points of production and  effect.
 The Wright outfit, which is admittedly one of the most effective  in use, takes one horsepower of force for the raising and propulsion of  each 50 pounds of weight.
 This, for a 25-horsepower engine, would give  a maximum lifting capacity of 1250 pounds.
 It is doubtful if any of  the higher rated motors have greater efficiency.
 As an 8-cylinder motor  requires more fuel to operate than a 4-cylinder, it naturally follows  that it is more expensive to run than the smaller motor, and a normal  increase in capacity, taking actual performances as a criterion, is  lacking.
 In other words, what is the sense of using an 8-cylinder motor  when one of 4 cylinders is sufficient?    What the Propeller Does.
    Much of the efficiency of the motor is due to the form and gearing of  the propeller.
 Here again, as in other vital parts of flying-machine  mechanism, we have a wide divergence of opinion as to the best form.
 A  fish makes progress through the water by using its fins and tail; a  bird makes its way through the air in a similar manner by the use of its  wings and tail.
 In both instances the motive power comes from the body  of the fish or bird.
    In place of fins or wings the flying machine is equipped with a  propeller, the action of which is furnished by the engine.
 Fins and  wings have been tried, but they don't work.
    While operating on the same general principle, aerial propellers are  much larger than those used on boats.
 This is because the boat  propeller has a denser, more substantial medium to work in (water), and  consequently can get a better "hold," and produce more propulsive force  than one of the same size revolving in the air.
 This necessitates the  aerial propellers being much larger than those employed for marine  purposes.
 Up to this point all aviators agree, but as to the best form  most of them differ.
    Kinds of Propellers Used.
    One of the most simple is that used by Curtiss.
 It consists of two  pear-shaped blades of laminated wood, each blade being 5 inches wide  at its extreme point, tapering slightly to the shaft connection.
 These  blades are joined at the engine shaft, in a direct line.
 The propeller  has a pitch of 5 feet, and weighs, complete, less than 10 pounds.
 The  length from end to end of the two blades is 6 1/2 feet.
    Wright uses two wooden propellers, in the rear of his biplane, revolving  in opposite directions.
 Each propeller is two-bladed.
    Bleriot also uses a two-blade wooden propeller, but it is placed in  front of his machine.
 The blades are each about 3 1/2 feet long and have  an acute "twist.
"    Santos-Dumont uses a two-blade wooden propeller, strikingly similar to  the Bleriot.
    On the Antoinette monoplane, with which good records have been made, the  propeller consists of two spoon-shaped pieces of metal, joined at the  engine shaft in front, and with the concave surfaces facing the machine.
    The propeller on the Voisin biplane is also of metal, consisting of two  aluminum blades connected by a forged steel arm.
    Maximum thrust, or stress--exercise of the greatest air-displacing  force--is the object sought.
 This, according to experts, is best  obtained with a large propeller diameter and reasonably low speed.
 The  diameter is the distance from end to end of the blades, which on the  largest propellers ranges from 6 to 8 feet.
 The larger the blade surface  the greater will be the volume of air displaced, and, following this,  the greater will be the impulse which forces the aeroplane ahead.
 In all  centrifugal motion there is more or less tendency to disintegration in  the form of "flying off" from the center, and the larger the revolving  object is the stronger is this tendency.
 This is illustrated in the many  instances in which big grindstones and fly-wheels have burst from being  revolved too fast.
 To have a propeller break apart in the air would  jeopardize the life of the aviator, and to guard against this it has  been found best to make its revolving action comparatively slow.
  Besides this the slow motion (it is only comparatively slow) gives the  atmosphere a chance to refill the area disturbed by one propeller blade,  and thus have a new surface for the next blade to act upon.
    Placing of the Motor.
    As on other points, aviators differ widely in their ideas as to the  proper position for the motor.
 Wright locates his on the lower plane,  midway between the front and rear edges, but considerably to one side of  the exact center.
 He then counter-balances the engine weight by placing  his seat far enough away in the opposite direction to preserve the  center of gravity.
 This leaves a space in the center between the motor  and the operator in which a passenger may be carried without disturbing  the equilibrium.
    Bleriot, on the contrary, has his motor directly in front and preserves  the center of gravity by taking his seat well back, this, with the  weight of the aeroplane, acting as a counter-balance.
    On the Curtiss machine the motor is in the rear, the forward seat of the  operator, and weight of the horizontal rudder and damping plane in front  equalizing the engine weight.
    No Perfect Motor as Yet.
    Engine makers in the United States, England, France and Germany are all  seeking to produce an ideal motor for aviation purposes.
 Many of the  productions are highly creditable, but it may be truthfully said that  none of them quite fill the bill as regards a combination of the minimum  of weight with the maximum of reliable maintained power.
 They are all,  in some respects, improvements upon those previously in use, but the  great end sought for has not been fully attained.
    One of the motors thus produced was made by the French firm of Darracq  at the suggestion of Santos Dumont, and on lines laid down by him.
  Santos Dumont wanted a 2-cylinder horizontal motor capable of developing  30 horsepower, and not exceeding 4 1/2 pounds per horsepower in weight.
    There can be no question as to the ability and skill of the Darracq  people, or of their desire to produce a motor that would bring new  credit and prominence to the firm.
 Neither could anything radically  wrong be detected in the plans.
 But the motor, in at least one important  requirement, fell short of expectations.
    It could not be depended upon to deliver an energy of 30 horsepower  continuously for any length of time.
 Its maximum power could be secured  only in "spurts.
"    This tends to show how hard it is to produce an ideal motor for aviation  purposes.
 Santos Dumont, of undoubted skill and experience as an  aviator, outlined definitely what he wanted; one of the greatest  designers in the business drew the plans, and the famous house of  Darracq bent its best energies to the production.
 But the desired end  was not fully attained.
    Features of Darracq Motor.
    Horizontal motors were practically abandoned some time ago in favor of  the vertical type, but Santos Dumont had a logical reason for reverting  to them.
 He wanted to secure a lower center of gravity than would be  possible with a vertical engine.
 Theoretically his idea was correct as  the horizontal motor lies flat, and therefore offers less resistance to  the wind, but it did not work out as desired.
    At the same time it must be admitted that this Darracq motor is a marvel  of ingenuity and exquisite workmanship.
 The two cylinders, having a bore  of 5 1-10 inches and a stroke of 4 7-10 inches, are machined out of a  solid bar of steel until their weight is only 8 4-5 pounds complete.
  The head is separate, carrying the seatings for the inlet and exhaust  valves, is screwed onto the cylinder, and then welded in position.
 A  copper water-jacket is fitted, and it is in this condition that the  weight of 8 4-5 pounds is obtained.
    On long trips, especially in regions where gasolene is hard to get,  the weight of the fuel supply is an important feature in aviation.
 As a  natural consequence flying machine operators favor the motor of greatest  economy in gasolene consumption, provided it gives the necessary power.
    An American inventor, Ramsey by name, is working on a motor which  is said to possess great possibilities in this line.
 Its distinctive  features include a connecting rod much shorter than usual, and a crank  shaft located the length of the crank from the central axis of the  cylinder.
 This has the effect of increasing the piston stroke, and also  of increasing the proportion of the crank circle during which effective  pressure is applied to the crank.
    Making the connecting rod shorter and leaving the crank mechanism the  same would introduce excessive cylinder friction.
 This Ramsey overcomes  by the location of his crank shaft.
 The effect of the long piston stroke  thus secured, is to increase the expansion of the gases, which in turn  increases the power of the engine without increasing the amount of fuel  used.
    Propeller Thrust Important.
    There is one great principle in flying machine propulsion which must  not be overlooked.
 No matter how powerful the engine may be unless the  propeller thrust more than overcomes the wind pressure there can be no  progress forward.
 Should the force of this propeller thrust and that of  the wind pressure be equal the result is obvious.
 The machine is at a  stand-still so far as forward progress is concerned and is deprived of  the essential advancing movement.
    Speed not only furnishes sustentation for the airship, but adds to the  stability of the machine.
 An aeroplane which may be jerky and uncertain  in its movements, so far as equilibrium is concerned, when moving at  a slow gait, will readily maintain an even keel when the speed is  increased.
    Designs for Propeller Blades.
    It is the object of all men who design propellers to obtain the maximum  of thrust with the minimum expenditure of engine energy.
 With this  purpose in view many peculiar forms of propeller blades have been  evolved.
 In theory it would seem that the best effects could be secured  with blades so shaped as to present a thin (or cutting) edge when they  come out of the wind, and then at the climax of displacement afford a  maximum of surface so as to displace as much air as possible.
 While  this is the form most generally favored there are others in successful  operation.
    There is also wide difference in opinion as to the equipment of the  propeller shaft with two or more blades.
 Some aviators use two and some  four.
 All have more or less success.
 As a mathematical proposition it  would seem that four blades should give more propulsive force than two,  but here again comes in one of the puzzles of aviation, as this result  is not always obtained.
    Difference in Propeller Efficiency.
    That there is a great difference in propeller efficiency is made readily  apparent by the comparison of effects produced in two leading makes of  machines--the Wright and the Voisin.
    In the former a weight of from 1,100 to 1,200 pounds is sustained and  advance progress made at the rate of 40 miles an hour and more, with  half the engine speed of a 25 horse-power motor.
 This would be a  sustaining capacity of 48 pounds per horsepower.
 But the actual capacity  of the Wright machine, as already stated, is 50 pounds per horsepower.
    The Voisin machine, with aviator, weighs about 1,370 pounds, and is  operated with a so-horsepower motor.
 Allowing it the same speed as the  Wright we find that, with double the engine energy, the lifting capacity  is only 27 1/2 pounds per horsepower.
 To what shall we charge this  remarkable difference? The surface of the planes is exactly the same in  both machines so there is no advantage in the matter of supporting area.
    Comparison of Two Designs.
    On the Wright machine two wooden propellers of two blades each (each  blade having a decided "twist") are used.
 As one 25 horsepower motor  drives both propellers the engine energy amounts to just one-half of  this for each, or 12 1/2 horsepower.
 And this energy is utilized at  one-half the normal engine speed.
    On the Voisin a radically different system is employed.
 Here we have  one metal two-bladed propeller with a very slight "twist" to the blade  surfaces.
 The full energy of a 50-horsepower motor is utilized.
    Experts Fail to Agree.
    Why should there be such a marked difference in the results obtained?  Who knows? Some experts maintain that it is because there are two  propellers on the Wright machine and only one on the Voisin, and  consequently double the propulsive power is exerted.
 But this is not a  fair deduction, unless both propellers are of the same size.
 Propulsive  power depends upon the amount of air displaced, and the energy put into  the thrust which displaces the air.
    Other experts argue that the difference in results may be traced to the  difference in blade design, especially in the matter of "twist.
"    The fact is that propeller results depend largely upon the nature of  the aeroplanes on which they are used.
 A propeller, for instance,  which gives excellent results on one type of aeroplane, will not work  satisfactorily on another.
    There are some features, however, which may be safely adopted in  propeller selection.
 These are: As extensive a diameter as possible;  blade area 10 to 15 per cent of the area swept; pitch four-fifths of  the diameter; rotation slow.
 The maximum of thrust effort will be thus  obtained.
        .
 PROPER DIMENSIONS OF MACHINES.
    In laying out plans for a flying machine the first thing to decide upon  is the size of the plane surfaces.
 The proportions of these must be  based upon the load to be carried.
 This includes the total weight of  the machine and equipment, and also the operator.
 This will be a rather  difficult problem to figure out exactly, but practical approximate  figures may be reached.
    It is easy to get at the weight of the operator, motor and propeller,  but the matter of determining, before they are constructed, what the  planes, rudders, auxiliaries, etc.
, will weigh when completed is an  intricate proposition.
 The best way is to take the dimensions of some  successful machine and use them, making such alterations in a minor way  as you may desire.
    Dimensions of Leading Machines.
    In the following tables will be found the details as to surface area,  weight, power, etc.

6    In giving the depth dimensions the length over all--from the extreme  edge of the front auxiliary plane to the extreme tip of the rear is  stated.
 Thus while the dimensions of the main planes of the Wright  machine are 41 feet spread by 6 1/2 feet in depth, the depth over all is  30.
7.
    Figuring Out the Details.
    With this data as a guide it should be comparatively easy to decide  upon the dimensions of the machine required.
 In arriving at the maximum  lifting capacity the weight of the operator must be added.
 Assuming this  to average 170 pounds the method of procedure would be as follows:    Add the weight of the operator to the weight of the complete machine.
  The new Wright machine complete weighs 900 pounds.
 This, plus 170, the  weight of the operator, gives a total of 1,070 pounds.
 There are 538  square feet of supporting surface, or practically one square foot of  surface area to each two pounds of load.
    There are some machines, notably the Bleriot, in which the supporting  power is much greater.
 In this latter instance we find a surface area of  150 1/2 square feet carrying a load of 680 plus 170, or an aggregate of  850 pounds.
 This is the equivalent of five pounds to the square foot.
  This ratio is phenomenally large, and should not be taken as a guide by  amateurs.
    The Matter of Passengers.
    These deductions are based on each machine carrying one passenger, which  is admittedly the limit at present of the monoplanes like those operated  for record-making purposes by Santos-Dumont and Bleriot.
 The biplanes,  however, have a two-passenger capacity, and this adds materially to the  proportion of their weight-sustaining power as compared with the surface  area.
 In the following statement all the machines are figured on the  one-passenger basis.
 Curtiss and Wright have carried two passengers on  numerous occasions, and an extra 170 pounds should therefore be added to  the total weight carried, which would materially increase the capacity.
  Even with the two-passenger load the limit is by no means reached,  but as experiments have gone no further it is impossible to make more  accurate figures.
    Average Proportions of Load.
    It will be interesting, before proceeding to lay out the dimension  details, to make a comparison of the proportion of load effect with  the supporting surfaces of various well-known machines.
 Here are the  figures:    Santos-Dumont--A trifle under four pounds per square foot.
    Bleriot--Five pounds.
    R.
 E.
 P.
--Five pounds.
    Antoinette--About two and one-quarter pounds.
    Curtiss--About two and one-half pounds.
    Wright--Two and one-quarter pounds.
    Farman--A trifle over three pounds.
    Voisin--A little under two and one-half pounds.
    Importance of Engine Power.
    While these figures are authentic, they are in a way misleading, as the  important factor of engine power is not taken into consideration.
 Let us  recall the fact that it is the engine power which keeps the machine in  motion, and that it is only while in motion that the machine will remain  suspended in the air.
 Hence, to attribute the support solely to the  surface area is erroneous.
 True, that once under headway the planes  contribute largely to the sustaining effect, and are absolutely  essential in aerial navigation--the motor could not rise without  them--still, when it comes to a question of weight-sustaining power, we  must also figure on the engine capacity.
    In the Wright machine, in which there is a lifting capacity of  approximately 2 1/4 pounds to the square foot of surface area, an engine  of only 25 horsepower is used.
 In the Curtiss, which has a lifting  capacity of 2 1/2 pounds per square foot, the engine is of 50  horsepower.
 This is another of the peculiarities of aerial construction  and navigation.
 Here we have a gain of 1/4 pound in weight-lifting  capacity with an expenditure of double the horsepower.
 It is this  feature which enables Curtiss to get along with a smaller surface area  of supporting planes at the expense of a big increase in engine power.
  Proper Weight of Machine.
    As a general proposition the most satisfactory machine for amateur  purposes will be found to be one with a total weight-sustaining power of  about 1,200 pounds.
 Deducting 170 pounds as the weight of the operator,  this will leave 1,030 pounds for the complete motor-equipped machine,  and it should be easy to construct one within this limit.
 This implies,  of course, that due care will be taken to eliminate all superfluous  weight by using the lightest material compatible with strength and  safety.
    This plan will admit of 686 pounds weight in the frame work, coverings,  etc.
, and 344 for the motor, propeller, etc.
, which will be ample.
 Just  how to distribute the weight of the planes is a matter which must be  left to the ingenuity of the builder.
    Comparison of Bird Power.
    There is an interesting study in the accompanying illustration.
 Note  that the surface area of the albatross is much smaller than that of the  vulture, although the wing spread is about the same.
 Despite this the  albatross accomplishes fully as much in the way of flight and soaring as  the vulture.
 Why? Because the albaboss is quicker and more powerful in  action.
 It is the application of this same principle in flying machines  which enables those of great speed and power to get along with less  supporting surface than those of slower movement.
    Measurements of Curtiss Machine.
    Some idea of framework proportion may be had from the following  description of the Curtiss machine.
 The main planes have a spread  (width) of 29 feet, and are 4 1/2 feet deep.
 The front double surface  horizontal rudder is 6x2 feet, with an area of 24 square feet.
 To the  rear of the main planes is a single surface horizontal plane 6x2 feet,  with an area of 12 square feet.
 In connection with this is a vertical  rudder 2 1/2 feet square.
 Two movable ailerons, or balancing planes, are  placed at the extreme ends of the upper planes.
 These are 6x2 feet,  and have a combined area of 24 square feet.
 There is also a triangular  shaped vertical steadying surface in connection with the front rudder.
    Thus we have a total of 195 square feet, but as the official figures are  258, and the size of the triangular-shaped steadying surface is unknown,  we must take it for granted that this makes up the difference.
 In  the matter of proportion the horizontal double-plane rudder is about  one-tenth the size of the main plane, counting the surface area of  only one plane, the vertical rudder one-fortieth, and the ailerons  one-twentieth.
        .
 PLANE AND RUDDER CONTROL.
    Having constructed and equipped your machine, the next thing is to  decide upon the method of controlling the various rudders and auxiliary  planes by which the direction and equilibrium and ascending and  descending of the machine are governed.
    The operator must be in position to shift instantaneously the position  of rudders and planes, and also to control the action of the motor.
 This  latter is supposed to work automatically and as a general thing does  so with entire satisfaction, but there are times when the supply of  gasolene must be regulated, and similar things done.
 Airship navigation  calls for quick action, and for this reason the matter of control is an  important one--it is more than important; it is vital.
    Several Methods of Control.
    Some aviators use a steering wheel somewhat after the style of that used  in automobiles, and by this not only manipulate the rudder planes, but  also the flow of gasolene.
 Others employ foot levers, and still others,  like the Wrights, depend upon hand levers.
    Curtiss steers his aeroplane by means of a wheel, but secures the  desired stabilizing effect with an ingenious jointed chair-back.
 This is  so arranged that by leaning toward the high point of his wing planes the  aeroplane is restored to an even keel.
 The steering post of the wheel is  movable backward and forward, and by this motion elevation is obtained.
    The Wrights for some time used two hand levers, one to steer by and warp  the flexible tips of the planes, the other to secure elevation.
 They  have now consolidated all the functions in one lever.
 Bleriot also uses  the single lever control.
    Farman employs a lever to actuate the rudders, but manipulates the  balancing planes by foot levers.
    Santos-Dumont uses two hand levers with which to steer and elevate,  but manipulates the planes by means of an attachment to the back of his  outer coat.
    Connection With the Levers.
    No matter which particular method is employed, the connection between  the levers and the object to be manipulated is almost invariably by  wire.
 For instance, from the steering levers (or lever) two wires  connect with opposite sides of the rudder.
 As a lever is moved so as to  draw in the right-hand wire the rudder is drawn to the right and vice  versa.
 The operation is exactly the same as in steering a boat.
 It  is the same way in changing the position of the balancing planes.
 A  movement of the hands or feet and the machine has changed its course,  or, if the equilibrium is threatened, is back on an even keel.
    Simple as this seems it calls for a cool head, quick eye, and steady  hand.
 The least hesitation or a false movement, and both aviator and  craft are in danger.
    Which Method is Best?    It would be a bold man who would attempt to pick out any one of these  methods of control and say it was better than the others.
 As in other  sections of aeroplane mechanism each method has its advocates who dwell  learnedly upon its advantages, but the fact remains that all the various  plans work well and give satisfaction.
    What the novice is interested in knowing is how the control is effected,  and whether he has become proficient enough in his manipulation of it to  be absolutely dependable in time of emergency.
 No amateur should attempt  a flight alone, until he has thoroughly mastered the steering and plane  control.
 If the services and advice of an experienced aviator are not to  be had the novice should mount his machine on some suitable supports so  it will be well clear of the ground, and, getting into the operator's  seat, proceed to make himself well acquainted with the operation of the  steering wheel and levers.
    Some Things to Be Learned.
    He will soon learn that certain movements of the steering gear produce  certain effects on the rudders.
 If, for instance, his machine is  equipped with a steering wheel, he will find that turning the wheel to  the right turns the aeroplane in the same direction, because the tiller  is brought around to the left.
 In the same way he will learn that a  given movement of the lever throws the forward edge of the main plane  upward, and that the machine, getting the impetus of the wind under the  concave surfaces of the planes, will ascend.
 In the same way it will  quickly become apparent to him that an opposite movement of the lever  will produce an opposite effect--the forward edges of the planes will be  lowered, the air will be "spilled" out to the rear, and the machine will  descend.
    The time expended in these preliminary lessons will be well spent.
 It  would be an act of folly to attempt to actually sail the craft without  them.
        .
 HOW TO USE THE MACHINE.
    It is a mistaken idea that flying machines must be operated at extreme  altitudes.
 True, under the impetus of handsome prizes, and the incentive  to advance scientific knowledge, professional aviators have ascended to  considerable heights, flights at from 500 to 1,500 feet being now  common with such experts as Farman, Bleriot, Latham, Paulhan, Wright and  Curtiss.
 The altitude record at this time is about 4,165 feet, held by  Paulhan.
    One of the instructions given by experienced aviators to pupils, and for  which they insist upon implicit obeyance, is: "If your machine gets more  than 30 feet high, or comes closer to the ground than 6 feet, descend at  once.
" Such men as Wright and Curtiss will not tolerate a violation of  this rule.
 If their instructions are not strictly complied with they  decline to give the offender further lessons.
    Why This Rule Prevails.
    There is good reason for this precaution.
 The higher the altitude the  more rarefied (thinner) becomes the air, and the less sustaining power  it has.
 Consequently the more difficult it becomes to keep in suspension  a given weight.
 When sailing within 30 feet of the ground sustentation  is comparatively easy and, should a fall occur, the results are not  likely to be serious.
 On the other hand, sailing too near the ground  is almost as objectionable in many ways as getting up too high.
 If the  craft is navigated too close to the ground trees, shrubs, fences and  other obstructions are liable to be encountered.
 There is also the  handicap of contrary air currents diverted by the obstructions referred  to, and which will be explained more fully further on.
    How to Make a Start.
    Taking it for granted that the beginner has familiarized himself with  the manipulation of the machine, and especially the control mechanism,  the next thing in order is an actual flight.
 It is probable that his  machine will be equipped with a wheeled alighting gear, as the skids  used by the Wrights necessitate the use of a special starting track.
  In this respect the wheeled machine is much easier to handle so far as  novices are concerned as it may be easily rolled to the trial grounds.
  This, as in the case of the initial experiments, should be a clear,  reasonably level place, free from trees, fences, rocks and similar  obstructions with which there may be danger of colliding.
    The beginner will need the assistance of three men.
 One of these should  take his position in the rear of the machine, and one at each end.
 On  reaching the trial ground the aviator takes his seat in the machine and,  while the men at the ends hold it steady the one in the rear assists in  retaining it until the operator is ready.
 In the meantime the aviator  has started his motor.
 Like the glider the flying machine, in order to  accomplish the desired results, should be headed into the wind.
    When the Machine Rises.
    Under the impulse of the pushing movement, and assisted by the motor  action, the machine will gradually rise from the ground--provided it  has been properly proportioned and put together, and everything is in  working order.
 This is the time when the aviator requires a cool head,  At a modest distance from the ground use the control lever to bring the  machine on a horizontal level and overcome the tendency to rise.
 The  exact manipulation of this lever depends upon the method of control  adopted, and with this the aviator is supposed to have thoroughly  familiarized himself as previously advised in .
    It is at this juncture that the operator must act promptly, but with the  perfect composure begotten of confidence.
 One of the great drawbacks in  aviation by novices is the tendency to become rattled, and this is much  more prevalent than one might suppose, even among men who, under other  conditions, are cool and confident in their actions.
    There is something in the sensation of being suddenly lifted from the  ground, and suspended in the air that is disconcerting at the start,  but this will soon wear off if the experimenter will keep cool.
 A few  successful flights no matter how short they may be, will put a lot of  confidence into him.
    Make Your Flights Short.
    Be modest in your initial flights.
 Don't attempt to match the records  of experienced men who have devoted years to mastering the details of  aviation.
 Paulhan, Farman, Bleriot, Wright, Curtiss, and all the rest of  them began, and practiced for years, in the manner here described, being  content to make just a little advancement at each attempt.
 A flight of  150 feet, cleanly and safely made, is better as a beginning than one of  400 yards full of bungling mishaps.
    And yet these latter have their uses, provided the operator is of a  discerning mind and can take advantage of them as object lessons.
 But,  it is not well to invite them.
 They will occur frequently enough under  the most favorable conditions, and it is best to have them come later  when the feeling of trepidation and uncertainty as to what to do has  worn off.
    Above all, don't attempt to fly too high.
 Keep within a reasonable  distance from the ground--about 25 or 30 feet.
 This advice is not given  solely to lessen the risk of serious accident in case of collapse, but  mainly because it will assist to instill confidence in the operator.
    It is comparatively easy to learn to swim in shallow water, but the  knowledge that one is tempting death in deep water begets timidity.
    Preserving the Equilibrium.
    After learning how to start and stop, to ascend and descend, the next  thing to master is the art of preserving equilibrium, the knack of  keeping the machine perfectly level in the air--on an "even keel," as  a sailor would say.
 This simile is particularly appropriate as all  aviators are in reality sailors, and much more daring ones than those  who course the seas.
 The latter are in craft which are kept afloat by  the buoyancy of the water, whether in motion or otherwise and, so long  as normal conditions prevail, will not sink.
 Aviators sail the air in  craft in which constant motion must be maintained in order to ensure  flotation.
    The man who has ridden a bicycle or motorcycle around curves at anything  like high speed, will have a very good idea as to the principle of  maintaining equilibrium in an airship.
 He knows that in rounding curves  rapidly there is a marked tendency to change the direction of the motion  which will result in an upset unless he overcomes it by an inclination  of his body in an opposite direction.
 This is why we see racers lean  well over when taking the curves.
 It simply must be done to preserve the  equilibrium and avoid a spill.
    How It Works In the Air.
    If the equilibrium of an airship is disturbed to an extent which  completely overcomes the center of gravity it falls according to the  location of the displacement.
 If this displacement, for instance, is at  either end the apparatus falls endways; if it is to the front or rear,  the fall is in the corresponding direction.
    Owing to uncertain air currents--the air is continually shifting and  eddying, especially within a hundred feet or so of the earth--the  equilibrium of an airship is almost constantly being disturbed to some  extent.
 Even if this disturbance is not serious enough to bring on  a fall it interferes with the progress of the machine, and should  be overcome at once.
 This is one of the things connected with aerial  navigation which calls for prompt, intelligent action.
    Frequently, when the displacement is very slight, it may be overcome,  and the craft immediately righted by a mere shifting of the operator's  body.
 Take, for illustration, a case in which the extreme right end  of the machine becomes lowered a trifle from the normal level.
 It is  possible to bring it back into proper position by leaning over to the  left far enough to shift the weight to the counter-balancing point.
 The  same holds good as to minor front or rear displacements.
    When Planes Must Be Used.
    There are other displacements, however, and these are the most frequent,  which can be only overcome by manipulation of the stabilizing planes.
  The method of procedure depends upon the form of machine in use.
 The  Wright machine, as previously explained, is equipped with plane ends  which are so contrived as to admit of their being warped (position  changed) by means of the lever control.
 These flexible tip planes move  simultaneously, but in opposite directions.
 As those on one end rise,  those on the other end fall below the level of the main plane.
 By this  means air is displaced at one point, and an increased amount secured in  another.
    This may seem like a complicated system, but its workings are simple  when once understood.
 It is by the manipulation or warping of these  flexible tips that transverse stability is maintained, and any tendency  to displacement endways is overcome.
 Longitudinal stability is governed  by means of the front rudder.
    Stabilizing planes of some form are a feature, and a necessary feature,  on all flying machines, but the methods of application and manipulation  vary according to the individual ideas of the inventors.
 They all tend,  however, toward the same end--the keeping of the machine perfectly level  when being navigated in the air.
    When to Make a Flight.
    A beginner should never attempt to make a flight when a strong wind is  blowing.
 The fiercer the wind, the more likely it is to be gusty and  uncertain, and the more difficult it will be to control the machine.
  Even the most experienced and daring of aviators find there is a limit  to wind speed against which they dare not compete.
 This is not because  they lack courage, but have the sense to realize that it would be silly  and useless.
    The novice will find a comparatively still day, or one when the wind is  blowing at not to exceed 15 miles an hour, the best for his experiments.
  The machine will be more easily controlled, the trip will be safer, and  also cheaper as the consumption of fuel increases with the speed of the  wind against which the aeroplane is forced.
        .
 PECULIARITIES OF AIRSHIP POWER.
    As a general proposition it takes much more power to propel an airship  a given number of miles in a certain time than it does an automobile  carrying a far heavier load.
 Automobiles with a gross load of 4,000  pounds, and equipped with engines of 30 horsepower, have travelled  considerable distances at the rate of 50 miles an hour.
 This is an  equivalent of about 134 pounds per horsepower.
 For an average modern  flying machine, with a total load, machine and passengers, of 1,200  pounds, and equipped with a 50-horsepower engine, 50 miles an hour  is the maximum.
 Here we have the equivalent of exactly 24 pounds per  horsepower.
 Why this great difference?    No less an authority than Mr. Octave Chanute answers the question in a  plain, easily understood manner.
 He says:    "In the case of an automobile the ground furnishes a stable support;  in the case of a flying machine the engine must furnish the support and  also velocity by which the apparatus is sustained in the air.
"    Pressure of the Wind.
    Air pressure is a big factor in the matter of aeroplane horsepower.
  Allowing that a dead calm exists, a body moving in the atmosphere  creates more or less resistance.
 The faster it moves, the greater is  this resistance.
 Moving at the rate of 60 miles an hour the resistance,  or wind pressure, is approximately 50 pounds to the square foot of  surface presented.
 If the moving object is advancing at a right angle  to the wind the following table will give the horsepower effect of the  resistance per square foot of surface at various speeds.
                                Horse Power            Miles per Hour    per sq.

12    While the pressure per square foot at 60 miles an hour, is only 1.
64  horsepower, at 100 miles, less than double the speed, it has increased  to 13.
12 horsepower, or exactly eight times as much.
 In other words the  pressure of the wind increases with the square of the velocity.
 Wind at  10 miles an hour has four times more pressure than wind at 5 miles an  hour.
    How to Determine Upon Power.
    This element of air resistance must be taken into consideration in  determining the engine horsepower required.
 When the machine is under  headway sufficient to raise it from the ground (about 20 miles an hour),  each square foot of surface resistance, will require nearly nine-tenths  of a horsepower to overcome the wind pressure, and propel the machine  through the air.
 As shown in the table the ratio of power required  increases rapidly as the speed increases until at 60 miles an hour  approximately 3 horsepower is needed.
    In a machine like the Curtiss the area of wind-exposed surface is about  15 square feet.
 On the basis of this resistance moving the machine at 40  miles an hour would require 12 horsepower.
 This computation covers only  the machine's power to overcome resistance.
 It does not cover the power  exerted in propelling the machine forward after the air pressure is  overcome.
 To meet this important requirement Mr. Curtiss finds it  necessary to use a 50-horsepower engine.
 Of this power, as has been  already stated, 12 horsepower is consumed in meeting the wind pressure,  leaving 38 horsepower for the purpose of making progress.
    The flying machine must move faster than the air to which it is opposed.
  Unless it does this there can be no direct progress.
 If the two forces  are equal there is no straight-ahead advancement.
 Take, for sake of  illustration, a case in which an aeroplane, which has developed a speed  of 30 miles an hour, meets a wind velocity of equal force moving in an  opposite direction.
 What is the result? There can be no advance because  it is a contest between two evenly matched forces.
 The aeroplane stands  still.
 The only way to get out of the difficulty is for the operator to  wait for more favorable conditions, or bring his machine to the ground  in the usual manner by manipulation of the control system.
    Take another case.
 An aeroplane, capable of making 50 miles an hour in a  calm, is met by a head wind of 25 miles an hour.
 How much progress does  the aeroplane make? Obviously it is 25 miles an hour over the ground.
    Put the proposition in still another way.
 If the wind is blowing harder  than it is possible for the engine power to overcome, the machine will  be forced backward.
    Wind Pressure a Necessity.
    While all this is true, the fact remains that wind pressure, up to  a certain stage, is an absolute necessity in aerial navigation.
 The  atmosphere itself has very little real supporting power, especially if  inactive.
 If a body heavier than air is to remain afloat it must move  rapidly while in suspension.
    One of the best illustrations of this is to be found in skating over  thin ice.
 Every school boy knows that if he moves with speed he may  skate or glide in safety across a thin sheet of ice that would not  begin to bear his weight if he were standing still.
 Exactly the same  proposition obtains in the case of the flying machine.
    The non-technical reason why the support of the machine becomes easier  as the speed increases is that the sustaining power of the atmosphere  increases with the resistance, and the speed with which the object is  moving increases this resistance.
 With a velocity of 12 miles an hour  the weight of the machine is practically reduced by 230 pounds.
 Thus, if  under a condition of absolute calm it were possible to sustain a weight  of 770 pounds, the same atmosphere would sustain a weight of 1,000  pounds moving at a speed of 12 miles an hour.
 This sustaining power  increases rapidly as the speed increases.
 While at 12 miles the  sustaining power is figured at 230 pounds, at 24 miles it is four times  as great, or 920 pounds.
    Supporting Area of Birds.
    One of the things which all producing aviators seek to copy is the  motive power of birds, particularly in their relation to the area of  support.
 Close investigation has established the fact that the larger  the bird the less is the relative area of support required to secure a  given result.
 This is shown in the following table:                                                       Supporting                    Weight       Surface       Horse      area       Bird         in lbs.

57    So far as known the condor is the largest of modern birds.
 It has a wing  stretch of 10 feet from tip to tip, a supporting area of about 10 square  feet, and weighs 17 pounds.
 It.
 is capable of exerting perhaps 1-30  horsepower.
 (These figures are, of course, approximate.
) Comparing the  condor with the buzzard with a wing stretch of 6 feet, supporting area  of 5 square feet, and a little over 1-100 horsepower, it may be seen  that, broadly speaking, the larger the bird the less surface area  (relatively) is needed for its support in the air.
    Comparison With Aeroplanes.
    If we compare the bird figures with those made possible by the  development of the aeroplane it will be readily seen that man has made a  wonderful advance in imitating the results produced by nature.
 Here are  the figures:                                                           Supporting                       Weight      Surface       Horse      area       Machine         in lbs.

448    While the average supporting surface is in favor of the aeroplane, this  is more than overbalanced by the greater amount of horsepower required  for the weight lifted.
 The average supporting surface in birds is about  three-quarters of a square foot per pound.
 In the average aeroplane it  is about one-half square foot per pound.
 On the other hand the average  aeroplane has a lifting capacity of 24 pounds per horsepower, while the  buzzard, for instance, lifts 5 pounds with 15-100 of a horsepower.
  If the Wright machine--which has a lifting power of 50 pounds per  horsepower--should be alone considered the showing would be much more  favorable to the aeroplane, but it would not be a fair comparison.
    More Surface, Less Power.
    Broadly speaking, the larger the supporting area the less will be the  power required.
 Wright, by the use of 538 square feet of supporting  surface, gets along with an engine of 25 horsepower.
 Curtiss, who uses  only 258 square feet of surface, finds an engine of 50 horsepower is  needed.
 Other things, such as frame, etc.
, being equal, it stands  to reason that a reduction in the area of supporting surface will  correspondingly reduce the weight of the machine.
 Thus we have the  Curtiss machine with its 258 square feet of surface, weighing only 600  pounds (without operator), but requiring double the horsepower of  the Wright machine with 538 square feet of surface and weighing 1,100  pounds.
 This demonstrates in a forceful way the proposition that the  larger the surface the less power will be needed.
    But there is a limit, on account of its bulk and awkwardness in  handling, beyond which the surface area cannot be enlarged.
 Otherwise  it might be possible to equip and operate aeroplanes satisfactorily with  engines of 15 horsepower, or even less.
    The Fuel Consumption Problem.
    Fuel consumption is a prime factor in the production of engine power.
  The veriest mechanical tyro knows in a general way that the more power  is secured the more fuel must be consumed, allowing that there is no  difference in the power-producing qualities of the material used.
 But  few of us understand just what the ratio of increase is, or how it is  caused.
 This proposition is one of keen interest in connection with  aviation.
    Let us cite a problem which will illustrate the point quoted: Allowing  that it takes a given amount of gasolene to propel a flying machine a  given distance, half the way with the wind, and half against it, the  wind blowing at one-half the speed of the machine, what will be the  increase in fuel consumption?    Increase of Thirty Per Cent.
    On the face of it there would seem to be no call for an increase as the  resistance met when going against the wind is apparently offset by the  propulsive force of the wind when the machine is travelling with  it.
 This, however, is called faulty reasoning.
 The increase in fuel  consumption, as figured by Mr. F.
 W.
 Lanchester, of the Royal Society of  Arts, will be fully 30 per cent over the amount required for a similar  operation of the machine in still air.
 If the journey should be made at  right angles to the wind under the same conditions the increase would be  15 per cent.
    In other words Mr. Lanchester maintains that the work done by the motor  in making headway against the wind for a certain distance calls for more  engine energy, and consequently more fuel by 30 per cent, than is saved  by the helping force of the wind on the return journey.
        .
 ABOUT WIND CURRENTS, ETC.
    One of the first difficulties which the novice will encounter is the  uncertainty of the wind currents.
 With a low velocity the wind, some  distance away from the ground, is ordinarily steady.
 As the velocity  increases, however, the wind generally becomes gusty and fitful in its  action.
 This, it should be remembered, does not refer to the velocity of  the machine, but to that of the air itself.
    In this connection Mr. Arthur T.
 Atherholt, president of the Aero  Club of Pennsylvania, in addressing the Boston Society of Scientific  Research, said:    "Probably the whirlpools of Niagara contain no more erratic currents  than the strata of air which is now immediately above us, a fact hard to  realize on account of its invisibility.
"    Changes In Wind Currents.
    While Mr. Atherholt's experience has been mainly with balloons it is all  the more valuable on this account, as the balloons were at the mercy of  the wind and their varying directions afforded an indisputable guide as  to the changing course of the air currents.
 In speaking of this he said:    "In the many trips taken, varying in distance traversed from twenty-five  to 900 miles, it was never possible except in one instance to maintain  a straight course.
 These uncertain currents were most noticeable in  the Gordon-Bennett race from St.
 Louis in 1907.
 Of the nine aerostats  competing in that event, eight covered a more or less direct course  due east and southeast, whereas the writer, with Major Henry B.
 Hersey,  first started northwest, then north, northeast, east, east by south,  and when over the center of Lake Erie were again blown northwest  notwithstanding that more favorable winds were sought for at altitudes  varying from 100 to 3,000 meters, necessitating a finish in Canada  nearly northeast of the starting point.
    "These nine balloons, making landings extending from Lake Ontario,  Canada, to Virginia, all started from one point within the same hour.
    "The single exception to these roving currents occurred on October 21st,  of last year (1909) when, starting from Philadelphia, the wind shifted  more than eight degrees, the greatest variation being at the lowest  altitudes, yet at no time was a height of over a mile reached.
    "Throughout the entire day the sky was overcast, with a thermometer  varying from fifty-seven degrees at 300 feet to forty-four degrees,  Fahrenheit at 5,000 feet, at which altitude the wind had a velocity of  43 miles an hour, in clouds of a cirro-cumulus nature, a landing finally  being made near Tannersville, New York, in the Catskill mountains, after  a voyage of five and one-half hours.
    "I have no knowledge of a recorded trip of this distance and duration,  maintained in practically a straight line from start to finish.
"    This wind disturbance is more noticeable and more difficult to contend  with in a balloon than in a flying machine, owing to the bulk and  unwieldy character of the former.
 At the same time it is not conducive  to pleasant, safe or satisfactory sky-sailing in an aeroplane.
 This is  not stated with the purpose of discouraging aviation, but merely that  the operator may know what to expect and be prepared to meet it.
    Not only does the wind change its horizontal course abruptly and without  notice, but it also shifts in a vertical direction, one second blowing  up, and another down.
 No man has as yet fathomed the why and wherefore  of this erratic action; it is only known that it exists.
    The most stable currents will be found from 50 to 100 feet from the  earth, provided the wind is not diverted by such objects as trees,  rocks, etc.
 That there are equally stable currents higher up is true,  but they are generally to be found at excessive altitudes.
    How a Bird Meets Currents.
    Observe a bird in action on a windy day and you will find it continually  changing the position of its wings.
 This is done to meet the varying  gusts and eddies of the air so that sustentation may be maintained and  headway made.
 One second the bird is bending its wings, altering the  angle of incidence; the next it is lifting or depressing one wing at a  time.
 Still again it will extend one wing tip in advance of the other,  or be spreading or folding, lowering or raising its tail.
    All these motions have a meaning, a purpose.
 They assist the bird in  preserving its equilibrium.
 Without them the bird would be just as  helpless in the air as a human being and could not remain afloat.
    When the wind is still, or comparatively so, a bird, having secured the  desired altitude by flight at an angle, may sail or soar with no wing  action beyond an occasional stroke when it desires to advance.
 But, in a  gusty, uncertain wind it must use its wings or alight somewhere.
    Trying to Imitate the Bird.
    Writing in _Fly_, Mr. William E.
 White says:    "The bird's flight suggests a number of ways in which the equilibrium  of a mechanical bird may be controlled.
 Each of these methods of control  may be effected by several different forms of mechanism.
    "Placing the two wings of an aeroplane at an angle of three to five  degrees to each other is perhaps the oldest way of securing lateral  balance.
 This way readily occurs to anyone who watches a sea gull  soaring.
 The theory of the dihedral angle is that when one wing is  lifted by a gust of wind, the air is spilled from under it; while  the other wing, being correspondingly depressed, presents a greater  resistance to the gust and is lifted restoring the balance.
 A fixed  angle of three to five degrees, however, will only be sufficient for  very light puffs of wind and to mount the wings so that the whole  wing may be moved to change the dihedral angle presents mechanical  difficulties which would be better avoided.
    "The objection of mechanical impracticability applies to any plan  to preserve the balance by shifting weight or ballast.
 The center of  gravity should be lower than the center of the supporting surfaces,  but cannot be made much lower.
 It is a common mistake to assume that  complete stability will be secured by hanging the center of gravity very  low on the principle of the parachute.
 An aeroplane depends upon rapid  horizontal motion for its support, and if the center of gravity be far  below the center of support, every change of speed or wind pressure will  cause the machine to turn about its center of gravity, pitching forward  and backward dangerously.
    Preserving Longitudinal Balance.
    "The birds maintain longitudinal, or fore and aft balance, by elevating  or depressing their tails.
 Whether this action is secured in an  aeroplane by means of a horizontal rudder placed in the rear, or by  deflecting planes placed in front of the main planes, the principle is  evidently the same.
 A horizontal rudder placed well to the rear as in  the Antoinette, Bleriot or Santos-Dumont monoplanes, will be very much  safer and steadier than the deflecting planes in front, as in the Wright  or Curtiss biplanes, but not so sensitive or prompt in action.
    "The natural fore and aft stability is very much strengthened by placing  the load well forward.
 The center of gravity near the front and a  tail or rudder streaming to the rear secures stability as an arrow is  balanced by the head and feathering.
 The adoption of this principle  makes it almost impossible for the aeroplane to turn over.
    The Matter of Lateral Balance.
    "All successful aeroplanes thus far have maintained lateral balance by  the principle of changing the angle of incidence of the wings.
    "Other ways of maintaining the lateral balance, suggested by observation  of the flight of birds are--extending the wing tips and spilling the air  through the pinions; or, what is the same thing, varying the area of the  wings at their extremities.
    "Extending the wing tips seems to be a simple and effective solution of  the problem.
 The tips may be made to swing outward upon a vertical axis  placed at the front edge of the main planes; or they may be hinged to  the ends of the main plane so as to be elevated or depressed through  suitable connections by the aviator; or they may be supported from a  horizontal axis parallel with the ends of the main planes so that they  may swing outward, the aviator controlling both tips through one lever  so that as one tip is extended the other is retracted.
    "The elastic wing pinions of a bird bend easily before the wind,  permitting the gusts to glance off, but presenting always an even and  efficient curvature to the steady currents of the air.
"    High Winds Threaten Stability.
    To ensure perfect stability, without control, either human or automatic,  it is asserted that the aeroplane must move faster than the wind is  blowing.
 So long as the wind is blowing at the rate of 30 miles an hour,  and the machine is traveling 40 or more, there will be little trouble as  regards equilibrium so far as wind disturbance goes, provided the wind  blows evenly and does not come in gusts or eddying currents.
 But when  conditions are reversed--when the machine travels only 30 miles an hour  and the wind blows at the rate of 50, look out for loss of equilibrium.
    One of the main reasons for this is that high winds are rarely steady;  they seldom blow for any length of time at the same speed.
 They are  usually "gusty," the gusts being a momentary movement at a higher speed.
  Tornadic gusts are also formed by the meeting of two opposing currents,  causing a whirling motion, which makes stability uncertain.
 Besides, it  is not unusual for wind of high speed to suddenly change its direction  without warning.
    Trouble With Vertical Columns.
    Vertical currents--columns of ascending air--are frequently encountered  in unexpected places and have more or less tendency, according to their  strength, to make it difficult to keep the machine within a reasonable  distance from the ground.
    These vertical currents are most generally noticeable in the vicinity  of steep cliffs, or deep ravines.
 In such instances they are usually of  considerable strength, being caused by the deflection of strong winds  blowing against the face of the cliffs.
 This deflection exerts a back  pressure which is felt quite a distance away from the point of origin,  so that the vertical current exerts an influence in forcing the machine  upward long before the cliff is reached.
        .
 THE ELEMENT OF DANGER.
    That there is an element of danger in aviation is undeniable, but it is  nowhere so great as the public imagines.
 Men are killed and injured in  the operation of flying machines just as they are killed and injured  in the operation of railways.
 Considering the character of aviation the  percentage of casualties is surprisingly small.
    This is because the results following a collapse in the air are very  much different from what might be imagined.
 Instead of dropping to the  ground like a bullet an aeroplane, under ordinary conditions will, when  anything goes wrong, sail gently downward like a parachute, particularly  if the operator is cool-headed and nervy enough to so manipulate the  apparatus as to preserve its equilibrium and keep the machine on an even  keel.
    Two Fields of Safety.
    At least one prominent aviator has declared that there are two fields  of safety--one close to the ground, and the other well up in the air.
 In  the first-named the fall will be a slight one with little chance of the  operator being seriously hurt.
 From the field of high altitude the the  descent will be gradual, as a rule, the planes of the machine serving to  break the force of the fall.
 With a cool-headed operator in control the  aeroplane may be even guided at an angle (about 1 to 8) in its descent  so as to touch the ground with a gliding motion and with a minimum of  impact.
    Such an experience, of course, is far from pleasant, but it is by no  means so dangerous as might appear.
 There is more real danger in falling  from an elevation of 75 or 100 feet than there is from 1,000 feet, as  in the former case there is no chance for the machine to serve as a  parachute--its contact with the ground comes too quickly.
    Lesson in Recent Accidents.
    Among the more recent fatalities in aviation are the deaths of Antonio  Fernandez and Leon Delagrange.
 The former was thrown to the ground by a  sudden stoppage of his motor, the entire machine seeming to collapse.
 It  is evident there were radical defects, not only in the motor, but in the  aeroplane framework as well.
 At the time of the stoppage it is  estimated that Fernandez was up about 1,500 feet, but the machine got  no opportunity to exert a parachute effect, as it broke up immediately.
  This would indicate a fatal weakness in the structure which, under  proper testing, could probably have been detected before it was used in  flight.
    It is hard to say it, but Delagrange appears to have been culpable to  great degree in overloading his machine with a motor equipment much  heavier than it was designed to sustain.
 He was 65 feet up in the air  when the collapse occurred, resulting in his death.
 As in the case of  Fernandez common-sense precaution would doubtless have prevented the  fatality.
    Aviation Not Extra Hazardous.
    All told there have been, up to the time of this writing (April, 1910),  just five fatalities in the history of power-driven aviation.
 This is  surprisingly low when the nature of the experiments, and the fact that  most of the operators were far from having extended experience, is taken  into consideration.
 Men like the Wrights, Curtiss, Bleriot, Farman,  Paulhan and others, are now experts, but there was a time, and it was  not long ago, when they were unskilled.
 That they, with numerous  others less widely known, should have come safely through their many  experiments would seem to disprove the prevailing idea that aviation is  an extra hazardous pursuit.
    In the hands of careful, quick-witted, nervy men the sailing of an  airship should be no more hazardous than the sailing of a yacht.
 A  vessel captain with common sense will not go to sea in a storm, or  navigate a weak, unseaworthy craft.
 Neither should an aviator attempt to  sail when the wind is high and gusty, nor with a machine which has not  been thoroughly tested and found to be strong and safe.
    Safer Than Railroading.
    Statistics show that some 12,000 people are killed and 72,000 injured  every year on the railroads of the United States.
 Come to think it over  it is small wonder that the list of fatalities is so large.
 Trains  are run at high speeds, dashing over crossings at which collisions are  liable to occur, and over bridges which often collapse or are swept away  by floods.
 Still, while the number of casualties is large, the actual  percentage is small considering the immense number of people involved.
    It is so in aviation.
 The number of casualties is remarkably small in  comparison with the number of flights made.
 In the hands of competent  men the sailing of an airship should be, and is, freer from risk of  accident than the running of a railway train.
 There are no rails  to spread or break, no bridges to collapse, no crossings at which  collisions may occur, no chance for some sleepy or overworked employee  to misunderstand the dispatcher's orders and cause a wreck.
    Two Main Causes of Trouble.
    The two main causes of trouble in an airship leading to disaster may  be attributed to the stoppage of the motor, and the aviator becoming  rattled so that he loses control of his machine.
 Modern ingenuity is  fast developing motors that almost daily become more and more reliable,  and experience is making aviators more and more self-confident in their  ability to act wisely and promptly in cases of emergency.
 Besides this  a satisfactory system of automatic control is in a fair way of being  perfected.
    Occasionally even the most experienced and competent of men in all  callings become careless and by foolish action invite disaster.
 This  is true of aviators the same as it is of railroaders, men who work in  dynamite mills, etc.
 But in nearly every instance the responsibility  rests with the individual; not with the system.
 There are some men  unfitted by nature for aviation, just as there are others unfitted to be  railway engineers.
        .
 RADICAL CHANGES BEING MADE.
    Changes, many of them extremely radical in their nature, are continually  being made by prominent aviators, and particularly those who have won  the greatest amount of success.
 Wonderful as the results have been  few of the aviators are really satisfied.
 Their successes have merely  spurred them on to new endeavors, the ultimate end being the development  of an absolutely perfect aircraft.
    Among the men who have been thus experimenting are the Wright Brothers,  who last year (1909) brought out a craft totally different as regards  proportions and weight from the one used the preceding year.
 One marked  result was a gain of about 3 1/2 miles an hour in speed.
    Dimensions of 1908 Machine.
    The 1908 model aeroplane was 40 by 29 feet over all.
 The carrying  surfaces, that is, the two aerocurves, were 40 by 6 feet, having a  parabolical curve of one in twelve.
 With about 70 square feet of surface  in the rudders, the total surface given was about 550 square feet.
  The engine, which is the invention of the Wright brothers, weighed,  approximately, 200 pounds, and gave about 25 horsepower at 1,400  revolutions per minute.
 The total weight of the aeroplane, exclusive of  passenger, but inclusive of engine, was about 1,150 pounds.
 This result  showed a lift of a fraction over 2 1/4 pounds to the square foot of  carrying surface.
 The speed desired was 40 miles an hour, but the  machine was found to make only a scant 39 miles an hour.
 The upright  struts were about 7/8-inch thick, the skids, 2 1/2 by 1 1/4 inches  thick.
    Dimensions of 1909 Machine.
    The 1909 aeroplane was built primarily for greater speed, and relatively  heavier; to be less at the mercy of the wind.
 This result was obtained  as follows: The aerocurves, or carrying surfaces, were reduced in  dimensions from 40 by 6 feet to 36 by 5 1/2 feet, the curve remaining  the same, one in twelve.
 The upright struts were cut from seven-eighths  inch to five-eighths inch, and the skids from two and one-half by one  and one-quarter to two and one-quarter by one and three-eighths inches.
  This result shows that there were some 81 square feet of carrying  surface missing over that of last year's model.
 and some 25 pounds loss  of weight.
 Relatively, though, the 1909 model aeroplane, while actually  25 pounds lighter, is really some 150 pounds heavier in the air than the  1908 model, owing to the lesser square feet of carrying surface.
    Some of the Results Obtained.
    Reducing the carrying surfaces from 6 to 5 1/2 feet gave two  results--first, less carrying capacity; and, second, less head-on  resistance, owing to the fact that the extent of the parabolic curve  in the carrying surfaces was shortened.
 The "head-on" resistance is  the retardance the aeroplane meets in passing through the air, and is  counted in square feet.
 In the 1908 model the curve being one in twelve  and 6 feet deep, gave 6 inches of head-on resistance.
 The plane being  40 feet spread, gave 6 inches by 40 feet, or 20 square feet of head-on  resistance.
 Increasing this figure by a like amount for each plane, and  adding approximately 10 square feet for struts, skids and wiring, we  have a total of approximately, 50 square feet of surface for "head-on"  resistance.
    In the 1909 aeroplane, shortening the curve 6 inches at the parabolic  end of the curve took off 1 inch of head-on resistance.
 Shortening the  spread of the planes took off between 3 and 4 square feet of head-on  resistance.
 Add to this the total of 7 square feet, less curve surface  and about 1 square foot, less wire and woodwork resistance, and we  have a grand total of, approximately, 12 square feet of less "head-on"  resistance over the 1908 model.
    Changes in Engine Action.
    The engine used in 1909 was the same one used in 1908, though some minor  changes were made as improvements; for instance, a make and break spark  was used, and a nine-tooth, instead of a ten-tooth magneto gear-wheel  was used.
 This increased the engine revolutions per minute from 1,200 to  1,400, and the propeller revolutions per minute from 350 to 371, giving  a propeller thrust of, approximately, 170 foot pounds instead of 153, as  was had last year.
    More Speed and Same Capacity.
    One unsatisfactory feature of the 1909 model over that of 1908,  apparently, was the lack of inherent lateral stability.
 This was caused  by the lesser surface and lesser extent of curvatures at the portions  of the aeroplane which were warped.
 This defect did not show so plainly  after Mr. Orville Wright had become fully proficient in the handling of  the new machine, and with skillful management, the 1909 model aeroplane  will be just as safe and secure as the other though it will take a  little more practice to get that same degree of skill.
    To sum up: The aeroplane used in 1909 was 25 pounds lighter, but really  about 150 pounds heavier in the air, had less head-on resistance, and  greater propeller thrust.
 The speed was increased from about 39 miles  per hour to 42 1/2 miles per hour.
 The lifting capacity remained about  the same, about 450 pounds capacity passenger-weight, with the 1908  machine.
 In this respect, the loss of carrying surface was compensated  for by the increased speed.
    During the first few flights it was plainly demonstrated that it would  need the highest skill to properly handle the aeroplane, as first one  end and then the other would dip and strike the ground, and either tear  the canvas or slew the aeroplane around and break a skid.
    Wrights Adopt Wheeled Gears.
    In still another important respect the Wrights, so far as the output  of one of their companies goes, have made a radical change.
 All the  aeroplanes turned out by the Deutsch Wright Gesellschaft, according to  the German publication, _Automobil-Welt_, will hereafter be equipped  with wheeled running gears and tails.
 The plan of this new machine is  shown in the illustration on page 145.
 The wheels are three in number,  and are attached one to each of the two skids, just under the front edge  of the planes, and one forward of these, attached to a cross-member.
 It  is asserted that with these wheels the teaching of purchasers to operate  the machines is much simplified, as the beginners can make short flights  on their own account without using the starting derrick.
    This is a big concession for the Wrights to make, as they have hitherto  adhered stoutly to the skid gear.
 While it is true they do not control  the German company producing their aeroplanes, yet the nature of their  connection with the enterprise is such that it may be taken for granted  no radical changes in construction would be made without their approval  and consent.
    Only Three Dangerous Rivals.
    Official trials with the 1909 model smashed many records and leave the  Wright brothers with only three dangerous rivals in the field, and with  basic patents which cover the curve, warp and wing-tip devices found on  all the other makes of aeroplanes.
 These three rivals are the Curtiss  and Voisin biplane type and the Bleriot monoplane pattern.
    The Bleriot monoplane is probably the most dangerous rival, as this make  of machine has a record of 54 miles per hour, has crossed the English  channel, and has lifted two passengers besides the operator.
 The  latest type of this machine only weighs 771.
61 pounds complete, without  passengers, and will lift a total passenger weight of 462.
97 pounds,  which is a lift of 5.
21 pounds to the square foot.
 This is a better  result than those published by the Wright brothers, the best noted being  4.
25 pounds per square foot.
    Other Aviators at Work.
    The Wrights, however, are not alone in their efforts to promote the  efficiency of the flying machine.
 Other competent inventive aviators,  notably Curtiss, Voisin, Bleriot and Farman, are close after them.
 The  Wrights, as stated, have a marked advantage in the possession of  patents covering surface plane devices which have thus far been found  indispensable in flying machine construction.
 Numerous law suits growing  out of alleged infringements of these patents have been started, and  others are threatened.
 What effect these actions will have in deterring  aviators in general from proceeding with their experiments remains to be  seen.
    In the meantime the four men named--Curtiss, Voisin, Bleriot and  Farman--are going ahead regardless of consequences, and the inventive  genius of each is so strong that it is reasonable to expect some  remarkable developments in the near future.
    Smallest of Flying Machines.
    To Santos Dumont must be given the credit of producing the smallest  practical flying machine yet constructed.
 True, he has done nothing  remarkable with it in the line of speed, but he has demonstrated the  fact that a large supporting surface is not an essential feature.
    This machine is named "La Demoiselle.
" It is a monoplane of the dihedral  type, with a main plane on each side of the center.
 These main  planes are of 18 foot spread, and nearly 6 1/2 feet in depth, giving  approximately 115 feet of surface area.
 The total weight is 242  pounds, which is 358 pounds less than any other machine which has been  successfully used.
 The total depth from front to rear is 26 feet.
    The framework is of bamboo, strengthened and held taut with wire guys.
    Have One Rule in Mind.
    In this struggle for mastery in flying machine efficiency all the  contestants keep one rule in mind, and this is:    "The carrying capacity of an aeroplane is governed by the peripheral  curve of its carrying surfaces, plus the speed; and the speed  is governed by the thrust of the propellers, less the 'head-on'  resistance.
"    Their ideas as to the proper means of approaching the proposition  may, and undoubtedly are, at variance, but the one rule in solving the  problem of obtaining the greatest carrying capacity combined with the  greatest speed, obtains in all instances.
        .
 SOME OF THE NEW DESIGNS.
    Spurred on by the success attained by the more experienced and better  known aviators numerous inventors of lesser fame are almost daily  producing practical flying machines varying radically in construction  from those now in general use.
    One of these comparatively new designs is the Van Anden biplane, made  by Frank Van Anden of Islip, Long Island, a member of the New York  Aeronautic Society.
 While his machine is wholly experimental, many  successful short flights were made with it last fall (1909).
 One flight,  made October 19th, 1909, is of particular interest as showing the  practicability of an automatic stabilizing device installed by the  inventor.
 The machine was caught in a sudden severe gust of wind and  keeled over, but almost immediately righted itself, thus demonstrating  in a most satisfactory manner the value of one new attachment.
    Features of Van Anden Model.
    In size the surfaces of the main biplane are 26 feet in spread, and 4  feet in depth from front to rear.
 The upper and lower planes are 4 feet  apart.
 Silkolene coated with varnish is used for the coverings.
 Ribs  (spruce) are curved one inch to the foot, the deepest part of the curve  (4 inches) being one foot back from the front edge of the horizontal  beam.
 Struts (also of spruce, as is all the framework) are elliptical in  shape.
 The main beams are in three sections, nearly half round in form,  and joined by metal sleeves.
    There is a two-surface horizontal rudder, 2x2x4 feet, in front.
 This  is pivoted at its lateral center 8 feet from the front edge of the main  planes.
 In the rear is another two-surface horizontal rudder 2x2x2 1/2  feet, pivoted in the same manner as the front one, 15 feet from the rear  edges of the main planes.
    Hinged to the rear central strut of the rear rudder is a vertical rudder  2 feet high by 3 feet in length.
    The Method of Control.
    In the operation of these rudders--both front and rear--and the  elevation and depression of the main planes, the Curtiss system is  employed.
 Pushing the steering-wheel post outward depresses the front  edges of the planes, and brings the machine downward; pulling the  steering-wheel post inward elevates the front edges of the planes and  causes the machine to ascend.
    Turning the steering wheel itself to the right swings the tail rudder to  the left, and the machine, obeying this like a boat, turns in the same  direction as the wheel is turned.
 By like cause turning the wheel to the  left turns the machine to the left.
    Automatic Control of Wings.
    There are two wing tips, each of 6 feet spread (length) and 2 feet from  front to rear.
 These are hinged half way between the main surfaces to  the two outermost rear struts.
 Cables run from these to an automatic  device working with power from the engine, which automatically operates  the tips with the tilting of the machine.
 Normally the wing tips are  held horizontal by stiff springs introduced in the cables outside of the  device.
    It was the successful working of this device which righted the Van  Anden craft when it was overturned in the squall of October 19th, 1909.
  Previous to that occurrence Mr. Van Anden had looked upon the device as  purely experimental, and had admitted that he had grave uncertainty as  to how it would operate in time of emergency.
 He is now quoted as being  thoroughly satisfied with its practicability.
 It is this automatic  device which gives the Van Anden machine at least one distinctively new  feature.
    While on this subject it will not be amiss to add that Mr. Curtiss does  not look kindly on automatic control.
 "I would rather trust to my own  action than that of a machine," he says.
 This is undoubtedly good  logic so far as Mr. Curtiss is concerned, but all aviators are not so  cool-headed and resourceful.
    Motive Power of Van Anden.
    A 50-horsepower "H-F" water cooled motor drives a laminated wood  propeller 6 feet in diameter, with a 17 degree pitch at the extremities,  increasing toward the hub.
 The rear end of the motor is about 6 inches  back from the rear transverse beam and the engine shaft is in a direct  line with the axes of the two horizontal rudders.
 An R.
 I.
 V.
 ball  bearing carries the shaft at this point.
 Flying, the motor turns at  about 800 revolutions per minute, delivering 180 pounds pull.
 A test of  the motor running at 1,200 showed a pull of 250 pounds on the scales.
    Still Another New Aeroplane.
    Another new aeroplane is that produced by A.
 M.
 Herring (an old-timer)  and W.
 S.
 Burgess, under the name of the Herring-Burgess.
 This is also  equipped with an automatic stability device for maintaining the balance  transversely.
 The curvature of the planes is also laid out on new  lines.
 That this new plan is effective is evidenced by the fact that the  machine has been elevated to an altitude of 40 feet by using one-half  the power of the 30-horsepower motor.
    The system of rudder and elevation control is very simple.
 The aviator  sits in front of the lower plane, and extending his arms, grasps two  supports which extend down diagonally in front.
 On the under side of  these supports just beneath his fingers are the controls which operate  the vertical rudder, in the rear.
 Thus, if he wishes to turn to the  right, he presses the control under the fingers of his right hand; if to  the left, that under the fingers of his left hand.
 The elevating rudder  is operated by the aviator's right foot, the control being placed on a  foot-rest.
    Motor Is Extremely Light.
    Not the least notable feature of the craft is its motor.
 Although  developing, under load, 30-horsepower, or that of an ordinary  automobile, it weighs, complete, hardly 100 pounds.
 Having occasion to  move it a little distance for inspection, Mr. Burgess picked it up and  walked off with it--cylinders, pistons, crankcase and all, even the  magneto, being attached.
 There are not many 30-horsepower engines which  can be so handled.
 Everything about it is reduced to its lowest terms  of simplicity, and hence, of weight.
 A single camshaft operates not  only all of the inlet and exhaust valves, but the magneto and gear water  pump, as well.
 The motor is placed directly behind the operator, and the  propeller is directly mounted on the crankshaft.
    This weight of less than 100 pounds, it must be remembered, is not for  the motor alone; it includes the entire power plant equipment.
    The "thrust" of the propeller is also extraordinary, being between 250  and 260 pounds.
 The force of the wind displacement is strong enough to  knock down a good-sized boy as one youngster ascertained when he got  behind the propeller as it was being tested.
 He was not only knocked  down but driven for some distance away from the machine.
 The propeller  has four blades which are but little wider than a lath.
    Machine Built by Students.
    Students at the University of Pennsylvania, headed by Laurence J.
 Lesh,  a protege of Octave Chanute, have constructed a practical aeroplane of  ordinary maximum size, in which is incorporated many new ideas.
 The most  unique of these is to be found in the steering gear, and the provision  made for the accommodation of a pupil while taking lessons under an  experienced aviator.
    Immediately back of the aviator is an extra seat and an extra steering  wheel which works in tandem style with the front wheel.
 By this  arrangement a beginner may be easily and quickly taught to have  perfect control of the machine.
 These tandem wheels are also handy for  passengers who may wish to operate the car independently of one another,  it being understood, of course, that there will be no conflict of  action.
    Frame Size and Engine Power.
    The frame has 36 feet spread and measures 35 feet from the front edge to  the end of the tail in the rear.
 It is equipped with two rear propellers  operated by a Ramsey 8-cylinder motor of 50 horsepower, placed  horizontally across the lower plane, with the crank shaft running clear  through the engine.
    The "Pennsylvania I" is the first two-propeller biplane chainless  car, this scheme having been adopted in order to avoid the crossing of  chains.
 The lateral control is by a new invention by Octave Chanute  and Laurence J.
 Lesh, for which Lesh is now applying for a patent.
 The  device was worked out before the Wright brothers' suit was begun, and is  said to be superior to the Wright warping or the Curtiss ailerons.
 The  landing device is also new in design.
 This aeroplane will weigh about  1,500 pounds, and will carry fuel for a flight of 150 miles, and it is  expected to attain a speed of at least 45 miles an hour.
    There are others, lots of them, too numerous in fact to admit of mention  in a book of this size.
        .
 DEMAND FOR FLYING MACHINES.
    As a commercial proposition the manufacture and sale of motor-equipped  aeroplanes is making much more rapid advance than at first obtained in  the similar handling of the automobile.
 Great, and even phenomenal,  as was the commercial development of the motor car, that of the flying  machine is even greater.
 This is a startling statement, but it is fully  warranted by the facts.
    It is barely more than a year ago (1909) that attention was seriously  attracted to the motor-equipped aeroplane as a vehicle possible of  manipulation by others than professional aviators.
 Up to that time  such actual flights as were made were almost exclusively with the sole  purpose of demonstrating the practicability of the machine, and the  merits of the ideas as to shape, engine power, etc.
, of the various  producers.
    Results of Bleriot's Daring.
    It was not until Bleriot flew across the straits of Dover on July 25th,  1909, that the general public awoke to a full realization of the fact  that it was possible for others than professional aviators to indulge  in aviation.
 Bleriot's feat was accepted as proof that at last  an absolutely new means of sport, pleasure and research, had been  practically developed, and was within the reach of all who had the  inclination, nerve and financial means to adopt it.
    From this event may be dated the birth of the modern flying machine into  the world of business.
 The automobile was taken up by the general public  from the very start because it was a proposition comparatively easy of  demonstration.
 There was nothing mysterious or uncanny in the fact that  a wheeled vehicle could be propelled on solid, substantial roads by  means of engine power.
 And yet it took (comparatively speaking) a long  time to really popularize the motor car.
    Wonderful Results in a Year.
    Men of large financial means engaged in the manufacture of automobiles,  and expended fortunes in attracting public attention to them through the  medium of advertisements, speed and road contests, etc.
 By these means  a mammoth business has been built up, but bringing this business to its  present proportions required years of patient industry and indomitable  pluck.
    At this writing, less than a year from the day when Bleriot crossed the  channel, the actual sales of flying machines outnumber the actual sales  of automobiles in the first year of their commercial development.
 This  may appear incredible, but it is a fact as statistics will show.
    In this connection we should take into consideration the fact that up to  a year ago there was no serious intention of putting flying machines  on the market; no preparations had been made to produce them on a  commercial scale; no money had been expended in advertisements with a  view to selling them.
    Some of the Actual Results.
    Today flying machines are being produced on a commercial basis, and  there is a big demand for them.
 The people making them are overcrowded  with orders.
 Some of the producers are already making arrangements to  enlarge their plants and advertise their product for sale the same as  is being done with automobiles, while a number of flying machine motor  makers are already promoting the sale of their wares in this way.
    Here are a few actual figures of flying machine sales made by the more  prominent producers since July 25th, 1909.
    Santos Dumont, 90 machines; Bleriot, 200; Farman, 130;  Clemenceau-Wright, 80; Voisin, 100; Antoinette, 100.
 Many of these  orders have been filled by delivery of the machines, and in others the  construction work is under way.
    The foregoing are all of foreign make.
 In this country Curtiss and the  Wrights are engaged in similar work, but no actual figures of their  output are obtainable.
    Larger Plants Are Necessary.
    And this situation exists despite the fact that none of the producers  are really equipped with adequate plants for turning out their  machines on a modern, business-like basis.
 The demand was so sudden and  unexpected that it found them poorly prepared to meet it.
 This, however,  is now being remedied by the erection of special plants, the enlargement  of others, and the introduction of new machinery and other labor-saving  conveniences.
    Companies, with large capitalization, to engage in the exclusive  production of airships are being organized in many parts of the world.
  One notable instance of this nature is worth quoting as illustrative  of the manner in which the production of flying machines is being  commercialized.
 This is the formation at Frankfort, Germany, of the  Flugmaschine Wright, G.
 m.
 b.
 H.
, with a capital of $119,000, the  Krupps, of Essen, being interested.
    Prices at Which Machines Sell.
    This wonderful demand from the public has come notwithstanding the fact  that the machines, owing to lack of facilities for wholesale production,  are far from being cheap.
 Such definite quotations as are made are on  the following basis:    Santos Dumont--List price $1,000, but owing to the rush of orders agents  are readily getting from $1,300 to $1,500.
 This is the smallest machine  made.
    Bleriot--List price $2,500.
 This is for the cross-channel type, with  Anzani motor.
    Antoinette--List price from $4,000 to $5,000, according to size.
    Wright--List price $5,600.
    Curtiss--List price $5,000.
    There is, however, no stability in prices as purchasers are almost  invariably ready to pay a considerable premium to facilitate delivery.
    The motor is the most expensive part of the flying machine.
 Motor  prices range from $500 to $2,000, this latter amount being asked for the  Curtiss engine.
    Systematic Instruction of Amateurs.
    In addition to the production of flying machines many of the experienced  aviators are making a business of the instruction of amateurs.
 Curtiss  and the Wrights in this country have a number of pupils, as have also  the prominent foreigners.
 Schools of instruction are being opened in  various parts of the world, not alone as private money-making ventures,  but in connection with public educational institutions.
 One of these  latter is to be found at the University of Barcelona, Spain.
    The flying machine agent, the man who handles the machines on a  commission, has also become a known quantity, and will soon be as  numerous as his brother of the automobile.
 The sign "John Bird, agent  for Skimmer's Flying Machine," is no longer a curiosity.
    Yes, the Airship Is Here.
    From all of which we may well infer that the flying machine in practical  form has arrived, and that it is here to stay.
 It is no exaggeration to  say that the time is close at hand when people will keep flying machines  just as they now keep automobiles, and that pleasure jaunts will be  fully as numerous and popular.
 With the important item of practicability  fully demonstrated, "Come, take a trip in my airship," will have more  real significance than now attaches to the vapid warblings of the  vaudeville vocalist.
    As a further evidence that the airship is really here, and that its  presence is recognized in a business way, the action of life and  accident insurance companies is interesting.
 Some of them are  reconstructing their policies so as to include a special waiver of  insurance by aviators.
 Anything which compels these great corporations  to modify their policies cannot be looked upon as a mere curiosity or  toy.
    It is some consolation to know that the movement in this direction is  not thus far widespread.
 Moreover it is more than probable that the  competition for business will eventually induce the companies to act  more liberally toward aviators, especially as the art of aviation  advances.
        .
 LAW OF THE AIRSHIP.
    Successful aviation has evoked some peculiar things in the way of legal  action and interpretation of the law.
    It is well understood that a man's property cannot be used without his  consent.
 This is an old established principle in common law which holds  good today.
    The limits of a man's property lines, however, have not been so well  understood by laymen.
 According to eminent legal authorities such as  Blackstone, Littleton and Coke, the "fathers of the law," the owner of  realty also holds title above and below the surface, and this theory is  generally accepted without question by the courts.
    Rights of Property Owners.
    In other words the owner of realty also owns the sky above it without  limit as to distance.
 He can dig as deep into his land, or go as high  into the air as he desires, provided he does not trespass upon or injure  similar rights of others.
    The owner of realty may resist by force, all other means having failed,  any trespass upon, or invasion of his property.
 Other people, for  instance, may not enter upon it, or over or under it, without his  express permission and consent.
 There is only one exception, and this is  in the case of public utility corporations such as railways which,  under the law of eminent domain, may condemn a right of way across the  property of an obstinate owner who declines to accept a fair price for  the privilege.
    Privilege Sharply Confined.
    The law of eminent domain may be taken advantage of only by corporations  which are engaged in serving the public.
 It is based upon the principle  that the advancement and improvement of a community is of more  importance and carries with it more rights than the interests of the  individual owner.
 But even in cases where the right of eminent domain is  exercised there can be no confiscation of the individual's property.
    Exercising the right of eminent domain is merely obtaining by public  purchase what is held to be essential to the public good, and which  cannot be secured by private purchase.
 When eminent domain proceedings  are resorted to the court appoints appraisers who determine upon the  value of the property wanted, and this value (in money) is paid to the  owner.
    How It Affects Aviation.
    It should be kept in mind that this privilege of the "right of eminent  domain" is accorded only to corporations which are engaged in serving  the public.
 Individuals cannot take advantage of it.
 Thus far all  aviation has been conducted by individuals; there are no flying machine  or airship corporations regularly engaged in the transportation of  passengers, mails or freight.
    This leads up to the question "What would happen if realty owners  generally, or in any considerable numbers, should prohibit the  navigation of the air above their holdings?" It is idle to say such  a possibility is ridiculous--it is already an actuality in a few  individual instances.
    One property owner in New Jersey, a justice of the peace, maintains a  large sign on the roof of his house warning aviators that they must not  trespass upon his domain.
 That he is acting well within his rights in  doing this is conceded by legal authorities.
    Hard to Catch Offenders.
    But, suppose the alleged trespass is committed, what is the property  owner going to do about it? He must first catch the trespasser and this  would be a pretty hard job.
 He certainly could not overtake him, unless  he kept a racing aeroplane for this special purpose.
 It would be  equally difficult to identify the offender after the offense had been  committed, even if he were located, as aeroplanes carry no license  numbers.
    Allowing that the offender should be caught the only recourse of the  realty owner is an action for damages.
 He may prevent the commission of  the offense by force if necessary, but after it is committed he can only  sue for damages.
 And in doing this he would have a lot of trouble.
    Points to Be Proven.
    One of the first things the plaintiff would be called upon to prove  would be the elevation of the machine.
 If it were reasonably close to  the ground there would, of course, be grave risk of damage to fences,  shrubbery, and other property, and the court would be justified in  holding it to be a nuisance that should be suppressed.
    If, on the other hand; the machine was well up in the air, but going  slowly, or hovering over the plaintiff's property, the court might be  inclined to rule that it could not possibly be a nuisance, but right  here the court would be in serious embarrassment.
 By deciding that it  was not a nuisance he would virtually override the law against invasion  of a man's property without his consent regardless of the nature of the  invasion.
 By the same decision he would also say in effect that, if one  flying machine could do this a dozen or more would have equal right to  do the same thing.
 While one machine hovering over a certain piece of  property may be no actual nuisance a dozen or more in the same position  could hardly be excused.
    Difficult to Fix Damages.
    Such a condition would tend to greatly increase the risk of accident,  either through collision, or by the carelessness of the aviators in  dropping articles which might cause damages to the people or property  below.
 In such a case it would undoubtedly be a nuisance, and in  addition to a fine, the offender would also be liable for the damages.
    Taking it for granted that no actual damage is done, and the owner  merely sues on account of the invasion of his property, how is the  amount of compensation to be fixed upon? The owner has lost nothing; no  part of his possessions has been taken away; nothing has been injured  or destroyed; everything is left in exactly the same condition as before  the invasion.
 And yet, if the law is strictly interpreted, the offender  is liable.
    Right of Way for Airships.
    Somebody has suggested the organization of flying-machine corporations  as common carriers, which would give them the right of eminent domain  with power to condemn a right of way.
 But what would they condemn? There  is nothing tangible in the air.
 Railways in condemning a right of way  specify tangible property (realty) within certain limits.
 How would an  aviator designate any particular right of way through the air a certain  number of feet in width, and a certain distance from the ground?    And yet, should the higher courts hold to the letter of the law and  decide that aviators have no right to navigate their craft over private  property, something will have to be done to get them out of the dilemma,  as aviation is too far advanced to be discarded.
 Fortunately there is  little prospect of any widespread antagonism among property owners so  long as aviators refrain from making nuisances of themselves.
    Possible Solution Offered.
    One possible solution is offered and that is to confine the path of  airships to the public highways so that nobody's property rights would  be invaded.
 In addition, as a matter of promoting safety for both  operators and those who may happen to be beneath the airships as they  pass over a course, adoption of the French rules are suggested.
 These  are as follows:    Aeroplanes, when passing, must keep to the right, and pass at a distance  of at least 150 feet.
 They are free from this rule when flying at  altitudes of more than 100 feet.
 Every machine when flying at night or  during foggy weather must carry a green light on the right, and a red  light on the left, and a white headlight on the front.
    These are sensible rules, but may be improved upon by the addition of a  signal system of some kind, either horn, whistle or bell.
    Responsibility of Aviators.
    Mr. Jay Carver Bossard, in recent numbers of _Fly_, brings out some  curious and interesting legal points in connection with aviation, among  which are the following:    "Private parties who possess aerial craft, and desire to operate the  same in aerial territory other than their own, must obtain from land  owners special permission to do so, such permission to be granted only  by agreement, founded upon a valid consideration.
 Otherwise, passing  over another's land will in each instance amount to a trespass.
    "Leaving this highly technical side of the question, let us turn to  another view: the criminal and tort liability of owners and operators to  airship passengers.
 If A invites B to make an ascension with him in his  machine, and B, knowing that A is merely an enthusiastic amateur and  far from being an expert, accepts and is through A's innocent negligence  injured, he has no grounds for recovery.
 But if A contracts with B, to  transport him from one place to another, for a consideration, and B is  injured by the poor piloting of A, A would be liable to B for damages  which would result.
 Now in order to safeguard such people as B, curious  to the point of recklessness, the law will have to require all airship  operators to have a license, and to secure this license airship pilots  will have to meet certain requirements.
 Here again is a question.
 Who  is going to say whether an applicant is competent to pilot a balloon or  airship?    Fine for an Aeronaut.
    "An aeroplane while maneuvering is suddenly caught by a treacherous gale  and swept to the ground.
 A crowd of people hasten over to see if the  aeronaut is injured, and in doing so trample over Tax-payer Smith's  garden, much to the detriment of his growing vegetables and flowers.
 Who  is liable for the damages? Queer as it may seem, a case very similar to  this was decided in 1823, in the New York supreme court, and it was held  that the aeronaut was liable upon the following grounds: 'To render one  man liable in trespass for the acts of others, it must appear either  that they acted in concert, or that the act of the one, ordinarily and  naturally produced the acts of the others, Ascending in a balloon is not  an unlawful act, but it is certain that the aeronaut has no control  over its motion horizontally, but is at the sport of the wind, and is  to descend when and how he can.
 His reaching the earth is a matter of  hazard.
 If his descent would according to the circumstances draw a crowd  of people around him, either out of curiosity, or for the purpose  of rescuing him from a perilous situation, all this he ought to have  foreseen, and must be responsible for.
'    Air Not Really Free.
    "The general belief among people is, that the air is free.
 Not only free  to breathe and enjoy, but free to travel in, and that no one has any  definite jurisdiction over, or in any part of it.
 Now suppose this were  made a legal doctrine.
 Would a murder perpetrated above the clouds have  to go unpunished? Undoubtedly.
 For felonies committed upon the high seas  ample provision is made for their punishment, but new provisions will  have to be made for crimes committed in the air.
    Relations of Owner and Employee.
    "It is a general rule of law that a master is bound to provide  reasonably safe tools, appliances and machines for his servant.
 How this  rule is going to be applied in cases of aeroplanes, remains to be seen.
  The aeroplane owner who hires a professional aeronaut, that is, one who  has qualified as an expert, owes him very little legal duty to supply  him with a perfect aeroplane.
 The expert is supposed to know as much  regarding the machine as the owner, if not more, and his acceptance of  his position relieves the owner from liability.
 When the owner hires an  amateur aeronaut to run the aeroplane, and teaches him how to manipulate  it, even though the prescribed manner of manipulation will make flight  safe, nevertheless if the machine is visibly defective, or known to be  so, any injury which results to the aeronaut the owner is liable for.
    As to Aeroplane Contracts.
    "At the present time there are many orders being placed with aeroplane  manufacturing companies.
 There are some unique questions to be raised  here under the law of contract.
 It is an elementary principle of law  that no one can be compelled to complete a contract which in itself is  impossible to perform.
 For instance, a contract to row a boat across  the Atlantic in two weeks, for a consideration, could never be enforced  because it is within judicial knowledge that such an undertaking is  beyond human power.
 Again, contracts formed for the doing of acts  contrary to nature are never enforcible, and here is where our  difficulty comes in.
 Is it possible to build a machine or species of  craft which will transport a person or goods through the air? The courts  know that balloons are practical; that is, they know that a bag  filled with gas has a lifting power and can move through the air at an  appreciable height.
 Therefore, a contract to transport a person in such  manner is a good contract, and the conditions being favorable could  undoubtedly be enforced.
 But the passengers' right of action for injury  would be very limited.
    No Redress for Purchasers.
    "In the case of giving warranties on aeroplanes, we have yet to see just  what a court is going to say.
 It is easy enough for a manufacturer to  guarantee to build a machine of certain dimensions and according to  certain specifications, but when he inserts a clause in the contract to  the effect that the machine will raise itself from the surface of the  earth, defy the laws of gravity, and soar in the heavens at the will of  the aviator, he is to say the least contracting to perform a miracle.
    "Until aeroplanes have been made and accepted as practical, no court  will force a manufacturer to turn out a machine guaranteed to fly.
 So  purchasers can well remember that if their machines refuse to fly they  have no redress against the maker, for he can always say, 'The industry  is still in its experimental stage.
' In contracting for an engine no  builder will guarantee that the particular engine will successfully  operate the aeroplane.
 In fact he could never be forced to live up to  such an agreement, should he agree to a stipulation of that sort.
 The  best any engine maker will guarantee is to build an engine according to  specifications.
"        .
 SOARING FLIGHT.
    By Octave Chanute.
    [5] There is a wonderful performance daily exhibited in southern climes  and occasionally seen in northerly latitudes in summer, which has  never been thoroughly explained.
 It is the soaring or sailing flight  of certain varieties of large birds who transport themselves on rigid,  unflapping wings in any desired direction; who in winds of 6 to 20  miles per hour, circle, rise, advance, return and remain aloft for hours  without a beat of wing, save for getting under way or convenience in  various maneuvers.
 They appear to obtain from the wind alone all the  necessary energy, even to advancing dead against that wind.
 This feat is  so much opposed to our general ideas of physics that those who have  not seen it sometimes deny its actuality, and those who have only  occasionally witnessed it subsequently doubt the evidence of their own  eyes.
 Others, who have seen the exceptional performances, speculate on  various explanations, but the majority give it up as a sort of "negative  gravity.
"    Soaring Power of Birds.
    The writer of this paper published in the "Aeronautical Annual" for 1896  and 1897 an article upon the sailing flight of birds, in which he gave  a list of the authors who had described such flight or had advanced  theories for its explanation, and he passed these in review.
 He also  described his own observations and submitted some computations to  account for the observed facts.
 These computations were correct as  far as they went, but they were scanty.
 It was, for instance, shown  convincingly by analysis that a gull weighing 2.
188 pounds, with a total  supporting surface of 2.
015 square feet, a maximum body cross-section  of 0.
126 square feet and a maximum cross-section of wing edges of 0.
098  square feet, patrolling on rigid wings (soaring) on the weather side of  a steamer and maintaining an upward angle or attitude of 5 degrees to 7  degrees above the horizon, in a wind blowing 12.
78 miles an hour, which  was deflected upward 10 degrees to 20 degrees by the side of the steamer  (these all being carefully observed facts), was perfectly sustained at  its own "relative speed" of 17.
88 miles per hour and extracted from  the upward trend of the wind sufficient energy to overcome all the  resistances, this energy amounting to 6.
44 foot-pounds per second.
    Great Power of Gulls.
    It was shown that the same bird in flapping flight in calm air, with an  attitude or incidence of 3 degrees to 5 degrees above the horizon and  a speed of 20.
4 miles an hour was well sustained and expended 5.
88  foot-pounds per second, this being at the rate of 204 pounds sustained  per horsepower.
 It was stated also that a gull in its observed  maneuvers, rising up from a pile head on unflapping wings, then plunging  forward against the wind and subsequently rising higher than his  starting point, must either time his ascents and descents exactly with  the variations in wind velocities, or must meet a wind billow rotating  on a horizontal axis and come to a poise on its crest, thus availing of  an ascending trend.
    But the observations failed to demonstrate that the variations of the  wind gusts and the movements of the bird were absolutely synchronous,  and it was conjectured that the peculiar shape of the soaring wing of  certain birds, as differentiated from the flapping wing, might, when  experimented upon, hereafter account for the performance.
    Mystery to be Explained.
    These computations, however satisfactory they were for the speed of  winds observed, failed to account for the observed spiral soaring of  buzzards in very light winds and the writer was compelled to confess:  "Now, this spiral soaring in steady breezes of 5 to 10 miles per hour  which are apparently horizontal, and through which the bird maintains an  average speed of about 20 miles an hour, is the mystery to be explained.
  It is not accounted for, quantitatively, by any of the theories which  have been advanced, and it is the one performance which has led some  observers to claim that it was done through 'aspiration.
' i, e.
, that  a bird acted upon by a current, actually drew forward into that current  against its exact direction of motion.
"    Buzzards Soar in Dead Calm.
    A still greater mystery was propounded by the few observers who asserted  that they had seen buzzards soaring in a dead calm, maintaining their  elevation and their speed.
 Among these observers was Mr. E.
 C.
 Huffaker,  at one time assistant experimenter for Professor Langley.
 The writer  believed and said then that he must in some way have been mistaken, yet,  to satisfy himself, he paid several visits to Mr. Huffaker, in Eastern  Tennessee and took along his anemometer.
 He saw quite a number of  buzzards sailing at a height of 75 to 100 feet in breezes measuring 5  or 6 miles an hour at the surface of the ground, and once he saw one  buzzard soaring apparently in a dead calm.
    The writer was fairly baffled.
 The bird was not simply gliding,  utilizing gravity or acquired momentum, he was actually circling  horizontally in defiance of physics and mathematics.
 It took two years  and a whole series of further observations to bring those two sciences  into accord with the facts.
    Results of Close Observations.
    Curiously enough the key to the performance of circling in a light wind  or a dead calm was not found through the usual way of gathering human  knowledge, i.
 e.
, through observations and experiment.
 These had failed  because I did not know what to look for.
 The mystery was, in fact,  solved by an eclectic process of conjecture and computation, but once  these computations indicated what observations should be made, the  results gave at once the reasons for the circling of the birds, for  their then observed attitude, and for the necessity of an independent  initial sustaining speed before soaring began.
 Both Mr. Huffaker and  myself verified the data many times and I made the computations.
    These observations disclosed several facts:    1st.
--That winds blowing five to seventeen miles per hour frequently had  rising trends of 10 degrees to 15 degrees, and that upon occasions when  there seemed to be absolutely no wind, there was often nevertheless a  local rising of the air estimated at a rate of four to eight miles or  more per hour.
 This was ascertained by watching thistledown, and rising  fogs alongside of trees or hills of known height.
 Everyone will readily  realize that when walking at the rate of four to eight miles an hour in  a dead calm the "relative wind" is quite inappreciable to the senses and  that such a rising air would not be noticed.
    2nd.
--That the buzzard, sailing in an apparently dead horizontal calm,  progressed at speeds of fifteen to eighteen miles per hour, as measured  by his shadow on the ground.
 It was thought that the air was then  possibly rising 8.
8 feet per second, or six miles per hour.
    3rd.
--That when soaring in very light winds the angle of incidence of  the buzzards was negative to the horizon--i.
 e.
, that when seen coming  toward the eye, the afternoon light shone on the back instead of on the  breast, as would have been the case had the angle been inclined above  the horizon.
    4th.
--That the sailing performance only occurred after the bird had  acquired an initial velocity of at least fifteen or eighteen miles per  hour, either by industrious flapping or by descending from a perch.
    An Interesting Experiment.
    5th.
--That the whole resistance of a stuffed buzzard, at a negative  angle of 3 degrees in a current of air of 15.
52 miles per hour, was 0.
27  pounds.
 This test was kindly made for the writer by Professor A.
 F.
 Zahm  in the "wind tunnel" of the Catholic University at Washington, D.
 C.
,  who, moreover, stated that the resistance of a live bird might be less,  as the dried plumage could not be made to lie smooth.
    This particular buzzard weighed in life 4.
25 pounds, the area of his  wings and body was 4.
57 square feet, the maximum cross-section of  his body was 0.
110 square feet, and that of his wing edges when fully  extended was 0.
244 square feet.
    With these data, it became surprisingly easy to compute the performance  with the coefficients of Lilienthal for various angles of incidence  and to demonstrate how this buzzard could soar horizontally in a dead  horizontal calm, provided that it was not a vertical calm, and that the  air was rising at the rate of four or six miles per hour, the lowest  observed, and quite inappreciable without actual measuring.
    Some Data on Bird Power.
    The most difficult case is purposely selected.
 For if we assume that the  bird has previously acquired an initial minimum speed of seventeen miles  an hour (24.
93 feet per second, nearly the lowest measured), and that  the air was rising vertically six miles an hour (8.
80 feet per second),  then we have as the trend of the "relative wind" encountered:          6        -- = 0.
353, or the tangent of 19 degrees 26'.
        17    which brings the case into the category of rising wind effects.
 But the  bird was observed to have a negative angle to the horizon of about 3  degrees, as near as could be guessed, so that his angle of incidence to  the "relative wind" was reduced to 16 degrees 26'.
    The relative speed of his soaring was therefore:    Velocity = square root of (17 squared + 6 squared) = 18.
03 miles per  hour.
    At this speed, using the Langley co-efficient recently practically  confirmed by the accurate experiments of Mr. Eiffel, the air pressure  would be:    18.
03 squared X 0.
00327 = 1.
063 pounds per square foot.
    If we apply Lilienthal's co-efficients for an angle of 6 degrees 26', we  have for the force in action:       Normal: 4.
57 X 1.
063 X 0.
912 = 4.
42 pounds.
       Tangential: 4.
57 X 1.
063 X 0.
074 = - 0.
359 pounds,     which latter, being negative, is a propelling force.
    Results Astonish Scientists.
    Thus we have a bird weighing 4.
25 pounds not only thoroughly supported,  but impelled forward by a force of 0.
359 pounds, at seventeen miles  per hour, while the experiments of Professor A.
 F.
 Zahm showed that the  resistance at 15.
52 miles per hour was only 0.
27 pounds,                  17 squared     or 0.
27 X ------- = 0.
324 pounds, at seventeen miles an               15.
52 squared     hour.
    These are astonishing results from the data obtained, and they lead to  the inquiry whether the energy of the rising air is sufficient to make  up the losses which occur by reason of the resistance and friction of  the bird's body and wings, which, being rounded, do not encounter air  pressures in proportion to their maximum cross-section.
    We have no accurate data upon the co-efficients to apply and estimates  made by myself proved to be much smaller than the 0.
27 pounds resistance  measured by Professor Zahm, so that we will figure with the latter as  modified.
 As the speed is seventeen miles per hour, or 24.
93 feet per  second, we have for the work:    Work done, 0.
324 X 24.
93 = 8.
07 foot pounds per second.
    Endorsed by Prof.
 Marvin.
    Corresponding energy of rising air is not sufficient at four miles per  hour.
 This amounts to but 2.
10 foot pounds per second, but if we assume  that the air was rising at the rate of seven miles per hour (10.
26 feet  per second), at which the pressure with the Langley coefficient would be  0.
16 pounds per square foot, we have on 4.
57 square feet for energy of  rising air: 4.
57 X 0.
16 X 10.
26 = 7.
50 foot pounds per second, which  is seen to be still a little too small, but well within the limits of  error, in view of the hollow shape of the bird's wings, which receive  greater pressure than the flat planes experimented upon by Langley.
    These computations were chiefly made in January, 1899, and were  communicated to a few friends, who found no fallacy in them, but thought  that few aviators would understand them if published.
 They were then  submitted to Professor C.
 F.
 Marvin of the Weather Bureau, who is well  known as a skillful physicist and mathematician.
 He wrote that they  were, theoretically, entirely sound and quantitatively, probably, as  accurate as the present state of the measurements of wind pressures  permitted.
 The writer determined, however, to withhold publication until  the feat of soaring flight had been performed by man, partly because he  believed that, to ensure safety, it would be necessary that the machine  should be equipped with a motor in order to supplement any deficiency in  wind force.
    Conditions Unfavorable for Wrights.
    The feat would have been attempted in 1902 by Wright brothers if the  local circumstances had been more favorable.
 They were experimenting on  "Kill Devil Hill," near Kitty Hawk, N.
 C.
 This sand hill, about 100  feet high, is bordered by a smooth beach on the side whence come the  sea breezes, but has marshy ground at the back.
 Wright brothers were  apprehensive that if they rose on the ascending current of air at the  front and began to circle like the birds, they might be carried by the  descending current past the back of the hill and land in the marsh.
  Their gliding machine offered no greater head resistance in proportion  than the buzzard, and their gliding angles of descent are practically as  favorable, but the birds performed higher up in the air than they.
    Langley's Idea of Aviation.
    Professor Langley said in concluding his paper upon "The Internal Work  of the Wind":    "The final application of these principles to the art of aerodromics  seems, then, to be, that while it is not likely that the perfected  aerodrome will ever be able to dispense altogether with the ability  to rely at intervals on some internal source of power, it will not be  indispensable that this aerodrome of the future shall, in order to go  any distance--even to circumnavigate the globe without alighting--need  to carry a weight of fuel which would enable it to perform this journey  under conditions analogous to those of a steamship, but that the fuel  and weight need only be such as to enable it to take care of itself in  exceptional moments of calm.
"    Now that dynamic flying machines have been evolved and are being brought  under control, it seems to be worth while to make these computations and  the succeeding explanations known, so that some bold man will attempt  the feat of soaring like a bird.
 The theory underlying the performance  in a rising wind is not new, it has been suggested by Penaud and others,  but it has attracted little attention because the exact data and  the maneuvers required were not known and the feat had not yet been  performed by a man.
 The puzzle has always been to account for the  observed act in very light winds, and it is hoped that by the present  selection of the most difficult case to explain--i.
 e.
, the soaring in a  dead horizontal calm--somebody will attempt the exploit.
    Requisites for Soaring Flights.
    The following are deemed to be the requisites and maneuvers to master  the secrets of soaring flight:    1st--Develop a dynamic flying machine weighing about one pound per  square foot of area, with stable equilibrium and under perfect control,  capable of gliding by gravity at angles of one in ten (5 3/4 degrees) in  still air.
    2nd.
--Select locations where soaring birds abound and occasions where  rising trends of gentle winds are frequent and to be relied on.
    3rd.
--Obtain an initial velocity of at least 25 feet per second before  attempting to soar.
    4th.
--So locate the center of gravity that the apparatus shall assume a  negative angle, fore and aft, of about 3 degrees.
    Calculations show, however, that sufficient propelling force may still  exist at 0 degrees, but disappears entirely at +4 degrees.
    5th.
--Circle like the bird.
 Simultaneously with the steering, incline  the apparatus to the side toward which it is desired to turn, so that  the centrifugal force shall be balanced by the centripetal force.
 The  amount of the required inclination depends upon the speed and on the  radius of the circle swept over.
    6th.
--Rise spirally like the bird.
 Steer with the horizontal rudder, so  as to descend slightly when going with the wind and to ascend when going  against the wind.
 The bird circles over one spot because the rising  trends of wind are generally confined to small areas or local chimneys,  as pointed out by Sir H.
 Maxim and others.
    7th.
--Once altitude is gained, progress may be made in any direction by  gliding downward by gravity.
    The bird's flying apparatus and skill are as yet infinitely superior  to those of man, but there are indications that within a few years the  latter may evolve more accurately proportioned apparatus and obtain  absolute control over it.
    It is hoped, therefore, that if there be found no radical error in the  above computations, they will carry the conviction that soaring flight  is not inaccessible to man, as it promises great economies of motive  power in favorable localities of rising winds.
    The writer will be grateful to experts who may point out any mistake  committed in data or calculations, and will furnish additional  information to any aviator who may wish to attempt the feat of soaring.

 FLYING MACHINES VS.
 BALLOONS.
    While wonderful success has attended the development of the dirigible  (steerable) balloon the most ardent advocates of this form of aerial  navigation admit that it has serious drawbacks.
 Some of these may be  described as follows:    Expense and Other Items.
    Great Initial Expense.
--The modern dirigible balloon costs a fortune.
  The Zeppelin, for instance, costs more than $100,000 (these are official  figures).
    Expense of Inflation.
--Gas evaporates rapidly, and a balloon must  be re-inflated, or partially re-inflated, every time it is used.
 The  Zeppelin holds 460,000 cubic feet of gas which, even at $1 per thousand,  would cost $460.
    Difficulty of Obtaining Gas.
--If a balloon suddenly becomes deflated, by  accident or atmospheric conditions, far from a source of gas supply, it  is practically worthless.
 Gas must be piped to it, or the balloon carted  to the gas house--an expensive proceeding in either event.
    Lack of Speed and Control.
    Lack of Speed.
--Under the most favorable conditions the maximum speed  of a balloon is 30 miles an hour.
 Its great bulk makes the high speed  attained by flying machines impossible.
    Difficulty of Control.
--While the modern dirigible balloon is readily  handled in calm or light winds, its bulk makes it difficult to control  in heavy winds.
    The Element of Danger.
--Numerous balloons have been destroyed by  lightning and similar causes.
 One of the largest of the Zeppelins was  thus lost at Stuttgart in 1908.
    Some Balloon Performances.
    It is only a matter of fairness to state that, under favorable  conditions, some very creditable records have been made with modern  balloons, viz:    November 23d, 1907, the French dirigible Patrie, travelled 187 miles in  6 hours and 45 minutes against a light wind.
 This was a little over 28  miles an hour.
    The Clement-Bayard, another French machine, sold to the Russian  government, made a trip of 125 miles at a rate of 27 miles an hour.
    Zeppelin No.
 3, carrying eight passengers, and having a total lifting  capacity of 5,500 pounds of ballast in addition to passengers, weight  of equipment, etc.
, was tested in October, 1906, and made 67 miles in 2  hours and 17 minutes, about 30 miles an hour.
    These are the best balloon trips on record, and show forcefully the  limitations of speed, the greatest being not over 30 miles an hour.
    Speed of Flying Machines.
    Opposed to the balloon performances we have flying machine trips (of  authentic records) as follows:    Bleriot--monoplane--in 1908--52 miles an hour.
    Delagrange--June 22, 1908--10 1/2 miles in 16 minutes, approximately 42  miles an hour.
    Wrights--October, 1905--the machine was then in its infancy--24 miles  in 38 minutes, approximately 44 miles an hour.
 On December 31, 1908, the  Wrights made 77 miles in 2 hours and 20 minutes.
    Lambert, a pupil of the Wrights, and using a Wright biplane, on October  18, 1909, covered 29.
82 miles in 49 minutes and 39 seconds, being at  the rate of 36 miles an hour.
 This flight was made at a height of 1,312  feet.
    Latham--October 21, 1909--made a short flight, about 11 minutes, in  the teeth of a 40 mile gale, at Blackpool, Eng.
 He used an Antoniette  monoplane, and the official report says: "This exhibition of nerve,  daring and ability is unparalled in the history of aviation.
"    Farman--October 20, 1909--was in the air for 1 hour, 32 min.
, 16  seconds, travelling 47 miles, 1,184 yards, a duration record for  England.
    Paulhan--January 18, 1901--47 1/2 miles at the rate of 45 miles an hour,  maintaining an altitude of from 1,000 to 2,000 feet.
    Expense of Producing Gas.
    Gas is indispensable in the operation of dirigible balloons, and gas  is expensive.
 Besides this it is not always possible to obtain it in  sufficient quantities even in large cities, as the supply on hand is  generally needed for regular customers.
 Such as can be had is either  water or coal gas, neither of which is as efficient in lifting power as  hydrogen.
    Hydrogen is the lightest and consequently the most buoyant of all known  gases.
 It is secured commercially by treating zinc or iron with dilute  sulphuric or hydrochloric acid.
 The average cost may be safely placed  at $10 per 1,000 feet so that, to inflate a balloon of the size of the  Zeppelin, holding 460,000 cubic feet, would cost $4,600.
    Proportions of Materials Required.
    In making hydrogen gas it is customary to allow 20 per cent for loss  between the generation and the introduction of the gas into the balloon.
  Thus, while the formula calls for iron 28 times heavier than the weight  of the hydrogen required, and acid 49 times heavier, the real quantities  are 20 per cent greater.
 Hydrogen weighs about 0.
09 ounce to the cubic  foot.
 Consequently if we need say 450,000 cubic feet of gas we must have  2,531.
25 pounds in weight.
 To produce this, allowing for the 20 percent  loss, we must have 35 times its weight in iron, or over 44 tons.
 Of acid  it would take 60 times the weight of the gas, or nearly 76 tons.
    In Time of Emergency.
    These figures are appalling, and under ordinary conditions would be  prohibitive, but there are times when the balloon operator, unable to  obtain water or coal gas, must foot the bills.
 In military maneuvers,  where the field of operation is fixed, it is possible to furnish  supplies of hydrogen gas in portable cylinders, but on long trips  where sudden leakage or other cause makes descent in an unexpected spot  unavoidable, it becomes a question of making your own hydrogen gas or  deserting the balloon.
 And when this occurs the balloonist is up against  another serious proposition--can he find the necessary zinc or iron? Can  he get the acid?    Balloons for Commercial Use.
    Despite all this the balloon has its uses.
 If there is to be such a  thing as aerial navigation in a commercial way--the carrying of freight  and passengers--it will come through the employment of such monster  balloons as Count Zeppelin is building.
 But even then the carrying  capacity must of necessity be limited.
 The latest Zeppelin creation,  a monster in size, is 450 feet long, and 42 1/2 feet in diameter.
 The  dimensions are such as to make all other balloons look like pigmies;  even many ocean-going steamers are much smaller, and yet its passenger  capacity is very small.
 On its 36-hour flight in May, 1909, the  Zeppelin, carried only eight passengers.
 The speed, however, was quite  respectable, 850 miles being covered in the 36 hours, a trifle over 23  miles an hour.
 The reserve buoyancy, that is the total lifting capacity  aside from the weight of the airship and its equipment, is estimated at  three tons.
        .
 PROBLEMS OF AERIAL FLIGHT.
    In a lecture before the Royal Society of Arts, reported in Engineering,  F.
 W.
 Lanchester took the position that practical flight was not the  abstract question which some apparently considered it to be, but a  problem in locomotive engineering.
 The flying machine was a locomotive  appliance, designed not merely to lift a weight, but to transport it  elsewhere, a fact which should be sufficiently obvious.
 Nevertheless one  of the leading scientific men of the day advocated a type in which  this, the main function of the flying machine, was overlooked.
 When  the machine was considered as a method of transport, the vertical screw  type, or helicopter, became at once ridiculous.
 It had, nevertheless,  many advocates who had some vague and ill-defined notion of subsequent  motion through the air after the weight was raised.
    Helicopter Type Useless.
    When efficiency of transport was demanded, the helicopter type was  entirely out of court.
 Almost all of its advocates neglected the effect  of the motion of the machine through the air on the efficiency of the  vertical screws.
 They either assumed that the motion was so slow as not  to matter, or that a patch of still air accompanied the machine in its  flight.
 Only one form of this type had any possibility of success.
 In  this there were two screws running on inclined axles--one on each  side of the weight to be lifted.
 The action of such inclined screw was  curious, and in a previous lecture he had pointed out that it was almost  exactly the same as that of a bird's wing.
 In high-speed racing craft  such inclined screws were of necessity often used, but it was at  a sacrifice of their efficiency.
 In any case the efficiency of the  inclined-screw helicopter could not compare with that of an aeroplane,  and that type might be dismissed from consideration so soon as  efficiency became the ruling factor of the design.
    Must Compete With Locomotive.
    To justify itself the aeroplane must compete, in some regard or other,  with other locomotive appliances, performing one or more of the purposes  of locomotion more efficiently than existing systems.
 It would be no use  unless able to stem air currents, so that its velocity must be greater  than that of the worst winds liable to be encountered.
 To illustrate the  limitations imposed on the motion of an aeroplane by wind velocity, Mr.  Lanchester gave the diagrams shown in Figs.
 1 to 4.
 The circle in each  case was, he said, described with a radius equal to the speed of the  aeroplane in still air, from a center placed "down-wind" from the  aeroplane by an amount equal to the velocity of the wind.
    Fig.
 1 therefore represented the case in which the air was still, and  in this case the aeroplane represented by _A_ had perfect liberty of  movement in any direction    In Fig.
 2 the velocity of the wind was half that of the aeroplane, and  the latter could still navigate in any direction, but its speed against  the wind was only one-third of its speed with the wind.
    In Fig.
 3 the velocity of the wind was equal to that of the aeroplane,  and then motion against the wind was impossible; but it could move to  any point of the circle, but not to any point lying to the left of the  tangent _A_ _B_.
 Finally, when the wind had a greater speed than the  aeroplane, as in Fig.
 4, the machine could move only in directions  limited by the tangents _A_ _C_ and _A_ _D_.
    Matter of Fuel Consumption.
    Taking the case in which the wind had a speed equal to half that of the  aeroplane, Mr. Lanchester said that for a given journey out and home,  down wind and back, the aeroplane would require 30 per cent more fuel  than if the trip were made in still air; while if the journey was made  at right angles to the direction of the wind the fuel needed would be 15  per cent more than in a calm.
 This 30 per cent extra was quite a heavy  enough addition to the fuel; and to secure even this figure it was  necessary that the aeroplane should have a speed of twice that of the  maximum wind in which it was desired to operate the machine.
 Again, as  stated in the last lecture, to insure the automatic stability of the  machine it was necessary that the aeroplane speed should be largely in  excess of that of the gusts of wind liable to be encountered.
    Eccentricities of the Wind.
    There was, Mr. Lanchester said, a loose connection between the average  velocity of the wind and the maximum speed of the gusts.
 When the  average speed of the wind was 40 miles per hour, that of the gusts might  be equal or more.
 At one moment there might be a calm or the direction  of the wind even reversed, followed, the next moment, by a violent gust.
  About the same minimum speed was desirable for security against gusts as  was demanded by other considerations.
 Sixty miles an hour was the least  figure desirable in an aeroplane, and this should be exceeded as much as  possible.
 Actually, the Wright machine had a speed of 38 miles per hour,  while Farman's Voisin machine flew at 45 miles per hour.
    Both machines were extremely sensitive to high winds, and the speaker,  in spite of newspaper reports to the contrary, had never seen either  flown in more than a gentle breeze.
 The damping out of the oscillations  of the flight path, discussed in the last lecture, increased with the  fourth power of the natural velocity of flight, and rapid damping  formed the easiest, and sometimes the only, defense against dangerous  oscillations.
 A machine just stable at 35 miles per hour would have  reasonably rapid damping if its speed were increased to 60 miles per  hour.
    Thinks Use Is Limited.
    It was, the lecturer proceeded, inconceivable that any very extended use  should be made of the aeroplane unless the speed was much greater than  that of the motor car.
 It might in special cases be of service,  apart from this increase of speed, as in the exploration of countries  destitute of roads, but it would have no general utility.
 With an  automobile averaging 25 to 35 miles per hour, almost any part of Europe,  Russia excepted, was attainable in a day's journey.
 A flying machine  of but equal speed would have no advantages, but if the speed could be  raised to 90 or 100 miles per hour, the whole continent of Europe  would become a playground, every part being within a daylight flight of  Berlin.
 Further, some marine craft now had speeds of 40 miles per hour,  and efficiently to follow up and report movements of such vessels an  aeroplane should travel at 60 miles per hour at least.
 Hence from  all points of view appeared the imperative desirability of very high  velocities of flight.
 The difficulties of achievement were, however,  great.
    Weight of Lightest Motors.
    As shown in the first lecture of his course, the resistance to motion  was nearly independent of the velocity, so that the total work done in  transporting a given weight was nearly constant.
 Hence the question of  fuel economy was not a bar to high velocities of flight, though should  these become excessive, the body resistance might constitute a large  proportion of the total.
 The horsepower required varied as the  velocity, so the factor governing the maximum velocity of flight was  the horsepower that could be developed on a given weight.
 At present the  weight per horsepower of feather-weight motors appeared to range from  2 1/4 pounds up to 7 pounds per brake horsepower, some actual figures  being as follows:             Antoinette.

6 lbs.
    Automobile engines, on the other hand, commonly weighed 12 pounds to 13  pounds per brake horsepower.
    For short flights fuel economy was of less importance than a saving  in the weight of the engine.
 For long flights, however, the case  was different.
 Thus, if the gasolene consumption was 1/2 pound per  horsepower hour, and the engine weighed 3 pounds per brake horsepower,  the fuel needed for a six-hour flight would weigh as much as the engine,  but for half an hour's flight its weight would be unimportant.
    Best Means of Propulsion.
    The best method of propulsion was by the screw, which acting in air  was subject to much the same conditions as obtained in marine work.
  Its efficiency depended on its diameter and pitch and on its position,  whether in front of or behind the body propelled.
 From this theory  of dynamic support, Mr. Lanchester proceeded, the efficiency of each  element of a screw propeller could be represented by curves such as were  given in his first lecture before the society, and from these curves the  over-all efficiency of any proposed propeller could be computed, by mere  inspection, with a fair degree of accuracy.
 These curves showed that the  tips of long-bladed propellers were inefficient, as was also the portion  of the blade near the root.
 In actual marine practice the blade from  boss to tip was commonly of such a length that the over-all efficiency  was 95 per cent of that of the most efficient element of it.
    Advocates Propellers in Rear.
    From these curves the diameter and appropriate pitch of a screw could  be calculated, and the number of revolutions was then fixed.
 Thus, for a  speed of 80 feet per second the pitch might come out as 8 feet, in which  case the revolutions would be 600 per minute, which might, however, be  too low for the motor.
 It was then necessary either to gear down the  propeller, as was done in the Wright machine, or, if it was decided to  drive it direct, to sacrifice some of the efficiency of the propeller.
  An analogous case arose in the application of the steam turbine to the  propulsion of cargo boats, a problem as yet unsolved.
 The propeller  should always be aft, so that it could abstract energy from the wake  current, and also so that its wash was clear of the body propelled.
 The  best possible efficiency was about 70 per cent, and it was safe to rely  upon 66 per cent.
    Benefits of Soaring Flight.
    There was, Mr. Lanchester proceeded, some possibility of the aeronaut  reducing the power needed for transport by his adopting the principle of  soaring flight, as exemplified by some birds.
 There were, he continued,  two different modes of soaring flight.
 In the one the bird made use of  the upward current of air often to be found in the neighborhood of steep  vertical cliffs.
 These cliffs deflected the air upward long before it  actually reached the cliff, a whole region below being thus the seat of  an upward current.
 Darwin has noted that the condor was only to be found  in the neighborhood of such cliffs.
 Along the south coast also the gulls  made frequent use of the up currents due to the nearly perpendicular  chalk cliffs along the shore.
    In the tropics up currents were also caused by temperature differences.
  Cumulus clouds, moreover, were nearly always the terminations of such  up currents of heated air, which, on cooling by expansion in the upper  regions, deposited their moisture as fog.
 These clouds might, perhaps,  prove useful in the future in showing the aeronaut where up currents  were to be found.
 Another mode of soaring flight was that adopted by  the albatross, which took advantage of the fact that the air moved  in pulsations, into which the bird fitted itself, being thus able to  extract energy from the wind.
 Whether it would be possible for the  aeronaut to employ a similar method must be left to the future to  decide.
    Main Difficulties in Aviation.
    In practical flight difficulties arose in starting and in alighting.
  There was a lower limit to the speed at which the machine was stable,  and it was inadvisable to leave the ground till this limit was attained.
  Similarly, in alighting it was inexpedient to reduce the speed below the  limit of stability.
 This fact constituted a difficulty in the adoption  of high speeds, since the length of run needed increased in proportion  to the square of the velocity.
 This drawback could, however, be  surmounted by forming starting and alighting grounds of ample size.
  He thought it quite likely in the future that such grounds would be  considered as essential to the flying machine as a seaport was to an  ocean-going steamer or as a road was to the automobile.
    Requisites of Flying Machine.
    Flying machines were commonly divided into monoplanes and biplanes,  according as they had one or two supporting surfaces.
 The distinction  was not, however, fundamental.
 To get the requisite strength some  form of girder framework was necessary, and it was a mere question of  convenience whether the supporting surface was arranged along both  the top and the bottom of this girder, or along the bottom only.
 The  framework adopted universally was of wood braced by ties of pianoforte  wire, an arrangement giving the stiffness desired with the least  possible weight.
 Some kind of chassis was also necessary.
        .
 AMATEURS MAY USE WRIGHT PATENTS.
    Owing to the fact that the Wright brothers have enjoined a number of  professional aviators from using their system of control, amateurs have  been slow to adopt it.
 They recognize its merits, and would like to use  the system, but have been apprehensive that it might involve them in  litigation.
 There is no danger of this, as will be seen by the following  statement made by the Wrights:    What Wright Brothers Say.
    "Any amateur, any professional who is not exhibiting for money, is at  liberty to use our patented devices.
 We shall be glad to have them do  so, and there will be no interference on our part, by legal action, or  otherwise.
 The only men we proceed against are those who, without our  permission, without even asking our consent, coolly appropriate the  results of our labors and use them for the purpose of making money.
  Curtiss, Delagrange, Voisin, and all the rest of them who have used our  devices have done so in money-making exhibitions.
 So long as there  is any money to be made by the use of the products of our brains, we  propose to have it ourselves.
 It is the only way in which we can get  any return for the years of patient work we have given to the problem of  aviation.
 On the other hand, any man who wants to use these devices for  the purpose of pleasure, or the advancement of science, is welcome to do  so, without money and without price.
 This is fair enough, is it not?"    Basis of the Wright Patents.
    In a flying machine a normally flat aeroplane having lateral marginal  portions capable of movement to different positions above or below the  normal plane of the body of the aeroplane, such movement being about  an axis transverse to the line of flight, whereby said lateral marginal  portions may be moved to different angles relatively to the normal  plane of the body of the aeroplane, so as to present to the atmosphere  different angles of incidence, and means for so moving said lateral  marginal portions, substantially as described.
    Application of vertical struts near the ends having flexible joints.
    Means for simultaneously imparting such movement to said lateral  portions to different angles relatively to each other.
    Refers to the movement of the lateral portions on the same side to the  same angle.
    Means for simultaneously moving vertical rudder so as to present to  the wind that side thereof nearest the side of the aeroplane having the  smallest angle of incidence.
    Lateral stability is obtained by warping the end wings by moving the  lever at the right hand of the operator, connection being made by wires  from the lever to the wing tips.
 The rudder may also be curved or warped  in similar manner by lever action.
    Wrights Obtain an Injunction.
    In January, 1910, Judge Hazel, of the United States Circuit Court,  granted a preliminary injunction restraining the Herring-Curtiss  Co.
, and Glenn H.
 Curtiss, from manufacturing, selling, or using for  exhibition purposes the machine known as the Curtiss aeroplane.
 The  injunction was obtained on the ground that the Curtiss machine is an  infringement upon the Wright patents in the matter of wing warping and  rudder control.
    It is not the purpose of the authors to discuss the subject pro or con.
  Such discussion would have no proper place in a volume of this kind.
 It  is enough to say that Curtiss stoutly insists that his machine is not  an infringement of the Wright patents, although Judge Hazel evidently  thinks differently.
    What the Judge Said.
    In granting the preliminary injunction the judge said:    "Defendants claim generally that the difference in construction of their  apparatus causes the equilibrium or lateral balance to be maintained and  its aerial movement secured upon an entirely different principle from  that of complainant; the defendants' aeroplanes are curved, firmly  attached to the stanchions and hence are incapable of twisting or  turning in any direction; that the supplementary planes or so-called  rudders are secured to the forward stanchion at the extreme lateral ends  of the planes and are adjusted midway between the upper and lower  planes with the margins extending beyond the edges; that in moving the  supplementary planes equal and uniform angles of incidence are presented  as distinguished from fluctuating angles of incidence.
 Such claimed  functional effects, however, are strongly contradicted by the expert  witness for complainant.
    Similar to Plan of Wrights.
    "Upon this contention it is sufficient to say that the affidavits for  the complainant so clearly define the principle of operation of the  flying machines in question that I am reasonably satisfied that there  is a variableness of the angle of incidence in the machine of defendants  which is produced when a supplementary plane on one side is tilted  or raised and the other stimultaneously tilted or lowered.
 I am also  satisfied that the rear rudder is turned by the operator to the side  having the least angle of incidence and that such turning is done at the  time the supplementary planes are raised or depressed to prevent tilting  or upsetting the machine.
 On the papers presented I incline to the view,  as already indicated, that the claims of the patent in suit should be  broadly construed; and when given such construction, the elements of  the Wright machine are found in defendants' machine performing the  same functional result.
 There are dissimilarities in the defendants'  structure--changes of form and strengthening of parts--which may be  improvements, but such dissimilarities seem to me to have no bearing  upon the means adopted to preserve the equilibrium, which means are the  equivalent of the claims in suit and attain an identical result.
    Variance From Patent Immaterial.
    "Defendants further contend that the curved or arched surfaces of the  Wright aeroplanes in commercial use are departures from the patent,  which describes 'substantially flat surfaces,' and that such a  construction would be wholly impracticable.
 The drawing, Fig.
 3,  however, attached to the specification, shows a curved line inward of  the aeroplane with straight lateral edges, and considering such drawing  with the terminology of the specification, the slight arching of the  surface is not thought a material departure; at any rate, the patent in  issue does not belong to the class of patents which requires narrowing  to the details of construction.
"    "June Bug" First Infringement.
    Referring to the matter of priority, the judge said:    "Indeed, no one interfered with the rights of the patentees by  constructing machines similar to theirs until in July, 1908, when  Curtiss exhibited a flying machine which he called the 'June Bug.
' He  was immediately notified by the patentees that such machine with its  movable surfaces at the tips of wings infringed the patent in suit, and  he replied that he did not intend to publicly exhibit the machine for  profit, but merely was engaged in exhibiting it for scientific purposes  as a member of the Aerial Experiment Association.
 To this the patentees  did not object.
 Subsequently, however, the machine, with supplementary  planes placed midway between the upper and lower aeroplanes, was  publicly exhibited by the defendant corporation and used by Curtiss in  aerial flights for prizes and emoluments.
 It further appears that the  defendants now threaten to continue such use for gain and profit, and to  engage in the manufacture and sale of such infringing machines, thereby  becoming an active rival of complainant in the business of constructing  flying machines embodying the claims in suit, but such use of the  infringing machines it is the duty of this court, on the papers  presented, to enjoin.
    "The requirements in patent causes for the issuance of an injunction  pendente lite--the validity of the patent, general acquiescence by the  public and infringement by the defendants--are so reasonably clear that  I believe if not probable the complainant may succeed at final hearing,  and therefore, status quo should be preserved and a preliminary  injunction granted.
    "So ordered.
"    Points Claimed By Curtiss.
    That the Herring-Curtiss Co.
 will appeal is a certainty.
 Mr. Emerson R.
  Newell, counsel for the company, states its case as follows:    "The Curtiss machine has two main supporting surfaces, both of which are  curved    and are absolutely rigid at all times and cannot be moved,  warped or distorted in any manner.
 The front horizontal rudder is used  for the steering up or down, and the rear vertical rudder is used only  for steering to the right or left, in the same manner as a boat is  steered by its rudder.
 The machine is provided at the rear with a fixed  horizontal surface, which is not present in the machine of the patent,  and which has a distinct advantage in the operation of defendants'  machine, as will be hereafter discussed.
    Does Not Warp Main Surface.
    "Defendants' machine does not use the warping of the main supporting  surfaces in restoring the lateral equilibrium, but has two comparatively  small pivoted balancing surfaces or rudders.
 When one end of the machine  is tipped up or down from the normal, these planes may be thrown in  opposite directions by the operator, and so steer each end of the  machine up or down to its normal level, at which time tension upon them  is released and they are moved back by the pressure of the wind to their  normal position.
    Rudder Used Only For Steering.
    "When defendants' balancing surfaces are moved they present equal angles  of incidence to the normal rush of air and equal resistances, at each  side of the machine, and there is therefore no tendency to turn around a  vertical axis as is the case of the machine of the patent, consequently  no reason or necessity for turning the vertical rear rudder in  defendants' machine to counteract any such turning tendency.
 At any  rate, whatever may be the theories in regard to this matter, the fact is  that the operator of defendants' machine does not at any time turn his  vertical rudder to counteract any turning tendency clue to the side  balancing surfaces, but only uses it to steer the machine the same as a  boat is steered.
"    Aero Club Recognizes Wrights.
    The Aero Club of America has officially recognized the Wright patents.
  This course was taken following a conference held April 9th, 1910,  participated in by William Wright and Andrew Freedman, representing the  Wright Co.
, and the Aero Club's committee, of Philip T.
 Dodge, W.
 W.
  Miller, L.
 L.
 Gillespie, Wm.
 H.
 Page and Cortlandt F.
 Bishop.
    At this meeting arrangements were made by which the Aero Club recognizes  the Wright patents and will not give its section to any open meet  where the promoters thereof have not secured a license from the Wright  Company.
    The substance of the agreement was that the Aero Club of America  recognizes the rights of the owners of the Wright patents under  the decisions of the Federal courts and refuses to countenance the  infringement of those patents as long as these decisions remain in  force.
    In the meantime, in order to encourage aviation, both at home and  abroad, and in order to permit foreign aviators to take part in aviation  contests in this country it was agreed that the Aero Club of America, as  the American representative of the International Aeronautic Federation,  should approve only such public contests as may be licensed by the  Wright Company and that the Wright Company, on the other hand, should  encourage the holding of open meets or contests where ever approved as  aforesaid by the Aero Club of America by granting licenses to promoters  who make satisfactory arrangements with the company for its compensation  for the use of its patents.
 At such licensed meet any machine of any  make may participate freely without securing any further license or  permit.
 The details and terms of all meets will be arranged by the  committee having in charge the interests of both organizations.
        .
 HINTS ON PROPELLER CONSTRUCTION.
    Every professional aviator has his own ideas as to the design of  the propeller, one of the most important features of flying-machine  construction.
 While in many instances the propeller, at a casual glance,  may appear to be identical, close inspection will develop the fact  that in nearly every case some individual idea of the designer has been  incorporated.
 Thus, two propellers of the two-bladed variety, while of  the same general size as to length and width of blade, will vary greatly  as to pitch and "twist" or curvature.
    What the Designers Seek.
    Every designer is seeking for the same result--the securing of the  greatest possible thrust, or air displacement, with the least possible  energy.
    The angles of any screw propeller blade having a uniform or true pitch  change gradually for every increased diameter.
 In order to give a  reasonably clear explanation, it will be well to review in a primary way  some of the definitions or terms used in connection with and applied to  screw propellers.
    Terms in General Use.
    Pitch.
--The term "pitch," as applied to a screw propeller, is the  theoretical distance through which it would travel without slip in one  revolution, and as applied to a propeller blade it is the angle at  which the blades are set so as to enable them to travel in a spiral path  through a fixed distance theoretically without slip in one revolution.
    Pitch speed.
--The term "pitch speed" of a screw propeller is the speed  in feet multiplied by the number of revolutions it is caused to make  in one minute of time.
 If a screw propeller is revolved 600 times  per minute, and if its pitch is 7 ft.
, then the pitch speed of such a  propeller would be 7x600 revolutions, or 4200 ft.
 per minute.
    Uniform pitch.
--A true pitch screw propeller is one having its blades  formed in such a manner as to enable all of its useful portions, from  the portion nearest the hub to its outer portion, to travel at a uniform  pitch speed.
 Or, in other words, the pitch is uniform when the projected  area of the blade is parallel along its full length and at the same time  representing a true sector of a circle.
    All screw propellers having a pitch equal to their diameters have the  same angle for their blades at their largest diameter.
    When Pitch Is Not Uniform.
    A screw propeller not having a uniform pitch, but having the same angle  for all portions of its blades, or some arbitrary angle not a true  pitch, is distinguished from one having a true pitch in the variation of  the pitch speeds that the various portions of its blades are forced to  travel through while traveling at its maximum pitch speed.
    On this subject Mr. R.
 W.
 Jamieson says in Aeronautics:    "Take for example an 8-foot screw propeller having an 8-foot pitch at  its largest diameter.
 If the angle is the same throughout its entire  blade length, then all the porions of its blades approaching the hub  from its outer portion would have a gradually decreasing pitch.
 The  2-foot portion would have a 2-foot pitch; the 3-foot portion a 3-foot  pitch, and so on to the 8-foot portion which would have an 8-foot pitch.
  When this form of propeller is caused to revolve, say 500 r.
p.
m.
, the  8-foot portion would have a calculated pitch speed of 8 feet by 500  revolutions, or 4,000 feet per min.
; while the 2-foot portion would have  a calculated pitch speed of 500 revolutions by 2 feet, or 1,000 feet per  minute.
    Effect of Non-Uniformity.
    "Now, as all of the portions of this type of screw propeller must travel  at some pitch speed, which must have for its maximum a pitch speed  in feet below the calculated pitch speed of the largest diameter, it  follows that some portions of its blades would perform useful work  while the action of the other portions would be negative--resisting  the forward motion of the portions having a greater pitch speed.
 The  portions having a pitch speed below that at which the screw is traveling  cease to perform useful work after their pitch speed has been exceeded  by the portions having a larger diameter and a greater pitch speed.
    "We might compare the larger and smaller diameter portions of this form  of screw propeller, to two power-driven vessels connected with a line,  one capable of traveling 20 miles per hour, the other 10 miles per hour.
  It can be readily understood that the boat capable of traveling 10 miles  per hour would have no useful effect to help the one traveling 20 miles  per hour, as its action would be such as to impose a dead load upon the  latter's progress.
"    The term "slip," as applied to a screw propeller, is the distance  between its calculated pitch speed and the actual distance it travels  through under load, depending upon the efficiency and proportion of its  blades and the amount of load it has to carry.
    The action of a screw propeller while performing useful work might be  compared to a nut traveling on a threaded bolt; little resistance is  offered to its forward motion while it spins freely without load, but  give it a load to carry; then it will take more power to keep up its  speed; if too great a load is applied the thread will strip, and so  it is with a screw propeller gliding spirally on the air.
 A propeller  traveling without load on to new air might be compared to the nut  traveling freely on the bolt.
 It would consume but little power and it  would travel at nearly its calculated pitch speed, but give it work to  do and then it will take power to drive it.
    There is a reaction caused from the propeller projecting air backward  when it slips, which, together with the supporting effect of the blades,  combine to produce useful work or pull on the object to be carried.
    A screw propeller working under load approaches more closely to its  maximum efficiency as it carries its load with a minimum amount of slip,  or nearing its calculated pitch speed.
    Why Blades Are Curved.
    It has been pointed out by experiment that certain forms of curved  surfaces as applied to aeroplanes will lift more per horse power, per  unit of square foot, while on the other hand it has been shown that a  flat surface will lift more per horse power, but requires more area of  surface to do it.
    As a true pitch screw propeller is virtually a rotating aeroplane, a  curved surface may be advantageously employed when the limit of size  prevents using large plane surfaces for the blades.
    Care should be exercised in keeping the chord of any curve to be used  for the blades at the proper pitch angle, and in all cases propeller  blades should be made rigid so as to preserve the true angle and not be  distorted by centrifugal force or from any other cause, as flexibility  will seriously affect their pitch speed and otherwise affect their  efficiency.
    How to Determine Angle.
    To find the angle for the proper pitch at any point in the diameter of  a propeller, determine the circumference by multiplying the diameter by  3.
1416, which represent by drawing a line to scale in feet.
 At the end  of this line draw another line to represent the desired pitch in feet.
  Then draw a line from the point representing the desired pitch in feet  to the beginning of the circumference line.
 For example:    If the propeller to be laid out is 7 feet in diameter, and is to have  a 7-foot pitch, the circumference will be 21.
99 feet.
 Draw a diagram  representing the circumference line and pitch in feet.
 If this diagram  is wrapped around a cylinder the angle line will represent a true thread  7 feet in diameter and 7 feet long, and the angle of the thread will be  17 3/4 degrees.
    Relation of Diameter to Circumference.
    Since the areas of circles decrease as the diameter lessens, it follows  that if a propeller is to travel at a uniform pitch speed, the volume of  its blade displacement should decrease as its diameter becomes less, so  as to occupy a corresponding relation to the circumferences of larger  diameters, and at the same time the projected area of the blade must be  parallel along its full length and should represent a true sector of a  circle.
    Let us suppose a 7-foot circle to be divided into 20 sectors, one of  which represents a propeller blade.
 If the pitch is to be 7 feet, then  the greatest depth of the angle would be 1/20 part of the pitch, or 4  2/10 inch.
 If the line representing the greatest depth of the angle is  kept the same width as it approaches the hub, the pitch will be uniform.
  If the blade is set at an angle so its projected area is 1/20 part of  the pitch, and if it is moved through 20 divisions for one revolution,  it would have a travel of 7 feet.
        .
 NEW MOTORS AND DEVICES.
    Since the first edition of this book was printed, early in 1910, there  has been a remarkable advance in the construction of aeroplane motors,  which has resulted in a wonderful decrease in the amount of surface area  from that formerly required.
 Marked gain in lightness and speed of  the motor has enabled aviators to get along, in some instances, with  one-quarter of the plane supporting area previously used.
 The first  Wright biplane, propelled by a motor of 25 h.
p.
, productive of a fair  average speed of 30 miles an hour, had a plane surface of 538 square  feet.
 Now, by using a specially designed motor of 65 h.
 p.
, capable  of developing a speed of from 70 to 80 miles an hour, the Wrights are  enabled to successfully navigate a machine the plane area of which is  about 130 square feet.
 This apparatus is intended to carry only one  person (the operator).
 At Belmont Park, N.
 Y.
, the Wrights demonstrated  that the small-surfaced biplane is much faster, easier to manage in the  hands of a skilled manipulator, and a better altitude climber than the  large and cumbersome machines with 538 square feet of surface heretofore  used by them.
    In this may be found a practical illustration of the principle that  increased speed permits of a reduction in plane area in mathematical  ratio to the gain in speed.
 The faster any object can be made to move  through the air, the less will be the supporting surface required to  sustain a given weight.
 But, there is a limit beyond which the plane  surface cannot be reduced with safety.
 Regard must always be had to  the securing of an ample sustaining surface so that in case of motor  stoppage there will be sufficient buoyancy to enable the operator to  descend safely.
    The baby Wright used at the Belmont Park (N.
 Y.
) aviation meet in the  fall of 1910, had a plane length of 19 feet 6 inches, and an extreme  breadth of 21 feet 6 inches, with a total surface area of 146 square  feet.
 It was equipped with a new Wright 8-cylinder motor of 60 h.
 p.
,  and two Wright propellers of 8 feet 6 inches diameter and 500 r.
 p.
 m.
  It was easily the fastest machine at the meet.
 After the tests, Wilbur  Wright said:    "It is our intention to put together a machine with specially designed  propellers, specially designed gears and a motor which will give us 65  horsepower at least.
 We will then be able, after some experimental work  we are doing now, to send forth a machine that will make a new speed  record.
"    In the new Wright machines the front elevating planes for up-and-down  control have been eliminated, and the movements of the apparatus are now  regulated solely by the rear, or "tail" control.
    A Powerful Light Motor.
    Another successful American aviation motor is the aeromotor,  manufactured by the Detroit Aeronautic Construction.
 Aeromotors are made  in four models as follows:    Model 1.
--4-cylinder, 30-40 h.
 p.
, weight 200 pounds.
    Model 2.
--4-cylinder, (larger stroke and bore) 40-50 h.
 p.
, weight 225  pounds.
    Model 3.
--6-cylinder.
 50-60 h.
 p.
, weight 210 pounds.
    Model 4.
--6-cylinder, 60-75 h.
 p.
, weight 275 pounds.
    This motor is of the 4-cycle, vertical, water-cooled type.
 Roberts  Aviation Motor.
    One of the successful aviation motors of American make, is that produced  by the Roberts Motor Co.
, of Sandusky, Ohio.
 It is designed by E.
 W.
  Roberts, M.
 E.
, who was formerly chief assistant and designer for Sir  Hiram Maxim, when the latter was making his celebrated aeronautical  experiments in England in 1894-95.
 This motor is made in both the  4- and 6-cylinder forms.
 The 4-cylinder motor weighs complete with Bosch  magneto and carbureter 165 pounds, and will develop 40 actual brake  h.
 p.
 at 1,000 r.
 p.
 m.
, 46 h.
 p.
 at 1,200 and 52 h.
 p.
 at 1,400.
 The  6-cylinder weighs 220 pounds and will develop 60 actual brake h.
 p.
 at  1,000 r.
 p.
 m.
, 69 h.
 p.
 at 1,200 and 78 h.
 p.
 at 1,500.
    Extreme lightness has been secured by doing away with all superfluous  parts, rather than by a shaving down of materials to a dangerous  thinness.
 For example, there is neither an intake or exhaust manifold on  the motor.
 The distributing valve forms a part of the crankcase as  does the water intake, and the gear pump.
 Magnalium takes the place of  aluminum in the crankcase, because it is not only lighter but stronger  and can be cast very thin.
 The crankshaft is 2 1/2-inch diameter with a  2 1/4-inch hole, and while it would be strong enough in ordinary 40  per cent carbon steel it is made of steel twice the strength of that  customarily employed.
 Similar care has been exercised on other parts and  the result is a motor weighing 4 pounds per h.
 p.
    The Rinek Motor.
    The Rinek aviation motor, constructed by the Rinek Aero Mfg.
 Co.
, of  Easton, Pa.
, is another that is meeting with favor among aviators.
 Type  B-8 is an 8-cylinder motor, the cylinders being set at right angles,  on a V-shaped crank case.
 It is water cooled, develops 50-60 h.
 p.
, the  minimum at 1,220 r.
 p.
 m.
, and weighs 280 pounds with all accessories.
  Type B-4, a 4-cylinder motor, develops 30 h.
 p.
 at 1,800 r.
 p.
 m.
, and  weighs 130 pounds complete.
 The cylinders in both motors are made of  cast iron with copper water jackets.
    The Overhead Camshaft Boulevard.
    The overhead camshaft Boulevard is still another form of aviation motor  which has been favorably received.
 This is the product of the Boulevard  Engine Co.
, of St.
 Louis.
 It is made with 4 and 8 cylinders.
 The former  develops 30-35 h.
 p.
 at 1,200 r.
 p.
 m.
, and weighs 130 pounds.
 The  8-cylinder motor gives 60-70 h.
 p.
 at 1,200 r.
 p.
 m.
, and weighs 200  pounds.
 Simplicity of construction is the main feature of this motor,  especially in the manipulation of the valves.
        .
 MONOPLANES, TRIPLANES, MULTIPLANES.
    Until recently, American aviators had not given serious attention to  any form of flying machines aside from biplanes.
 Of the twenty-one  monoplanes competing at the International meet at Belmont Park, N.
 Y.
,  in November, 1910, only three makes were handled by Americans.
 Moissant  and Drexel navigated Bleriot machines, Harkness an Antoinette, and Glenn  Curtiss a single decker of his own construction.
 On the other hand the  various foreign aviators who took part in the meet unhesitatingly gave  preference to monoplanes.
    Whatever may have been the cause of this seeming prejudice against  the monoplane on the part of American air sailors, it is slowly being  overcome.
 When a man like Curtiss, who has attained great success with  biplanes, gives serious attention to the monoplane form of construction  and goes so far as to build and successfully operate a single surface  machine, it may be taken for granted that the monoplane is a fixture in  this country.
    Dimensions of Monoplanes.
    The makes, dimensions and equipment of the various monoplanes used at  Belmont Park are as follows:    Bleriot--(Moissant, operator)--plane length 23 feet, extreme breadth 28  feet, surface area 160 square feet, 7-cylinder, 50 h.
 p.
 Gnome engine,  Chauviere propeller, 7 feet 6 inches diameter, 1,200 r.
 p.
 m.
    Bleriot--(Drexel, operator)--exactly the same as Moissant's machine.
    Antoinette--(Harkness, operator)--plane length 42 feet, extreme breadth  46 feet, surface area 377 square feet, Emerson 6-cylinder, 50 h.
 p.
  motor, Antoinette propeller, 7 feet 6 inches diameter, 1,200 r.
 p.
 m.
    Curtiss--(Glenn H.
 Curtiss, operator)--plane length 25 feet, extreme  breadth 26 feet, surface area 130 square feet, Curtiss 8-cylinder, 60 h.
  p.
 motor, Paragon propeller, 7 feet in diameter, 1,200 r.
 p.
 m.
    With one exception Curtiss had the smallest machine of any of those  entering into competition.
 The smallest was La Demoiselle, made by  Santos-Dumont, the proportions of which were: plane length 20 feet,  extreme breadth 18 feet, surface area 100 square feet, Clement-Bayard  2-cylinder, 30 h.
 p.
 motor, Chauviere propeller, 6 feet 6 inches in  diameter, 1,100 r.
 p.
 m.
    Winnings Made with Monoplanes.
    Operators of monoplanes won a fair share of the cash prizes.
 They won  $30,283 out of a total of $63,250, to say nothing about Grahame-White's  winnings.
 The latter won $13,600, but part of his winning flights were  made in a Bleriot monoplane, and part in a Farman machine.
 Aside from  Grahame-White the winnings were divided as follows: Moissant (Bleriot)  $13,350; Latham (Antoinette) $8,183; Aubrun (Bleriot) $2,400; De Lesseps  (Bleriot) $2,300; Drexel (Bleriot) $1,700; Radley (Bleriot) $1,300;  Simon (Bleriot) $750; Andemars (Clement-Bayard) $100; Barrier (Bleriot)  $100.
    Out of a total of $30,283, operators of Bleriot machines won $21,900,  again omitting Grahame-White's share.
 If the winnings with monoplane and  biplane could be divided so as to show the amount won with each type  of machine the credit side of the Bleriot account would be materially  enlarged.
    The Most Popular Monoplanes.
    While the number of successful monoplanes is increasing rapidly, and  there is some feature of advantage in nearly all the new makes, interest  centers chiefly in the Santos-Dumont, Antoinette and Bleriot machines.
  This is because more has been accomplished with them than with any of  the others, possibly because they have had greater opportunities.
    For the guidance of those who may wish to build a machine of the  monoplane type after the Santos-Dumont or Bleriot models, the following  details will be found useful.
    Santos-Dumont--The latest production of this maker is called the "No.
 20  Baby.
" It is of 18 feet spread, and 20 feet over all in depth.
 It stands  4 feet 2 inches in height, not counting the propeller.
 When this latter  is in a vertical position the extreme height of the machine is 7 feet  5 inches.
 It is strictly a one-man apparatus.
 The total surface area  is 115 square feet.
 The total weight of the monoplane with engine and  propeller is 352 pounds.
 Santos-Dumont weighs 110 pounds, so the entire  weight carried while in flight is 462 pounds, or about 3.
6 pounds per  square foot of surface.
    Bamboo is used in the construction of the body frame, and also for the  frame of the tail.
 The body frame consists of three bamboo poles about  2 inches in diameter at the forward end and tapering to about 1 inch at  the rear.
 These poles are jointed with brass sockets near the rear of  the main plane so they may be taken apart easily for convenience in  housing or transportation.
 The main plane is built upon four transverse  spars of ash, set at a slight dihedral angle, two being placed on each  side of the central bamboo.
 These spars are about 2 inches wide by 1  1/8-inch deep for a few feet each side of the center of the machine, and  from there taper down to an inch in depth at the center bamboo, and at  their outer ends, but the width remains the same throughout their entire  length.
 The planes are double surfaced with silk and laced above and  below the bamboo ribs which run fore and aft under the main spars and  terminate in a forked clip through which a wire is strung for lacing on  the silk.
 The tail consists of a horizontal and vertical surface placed  on a universal joint about 10 feet back of the rear edge of the main  plane.
 Both of these surfaces are flat and consist of a silk covering  stretched upon bamboo ribs.
 The horizontal surface is 6 feet 5 inches  across, and 4 feet 9 inches from front to back.
 The vertical surface  is of the same width (6 feet 5 inches) but is only 3 feet 7 inches  from front to back.
 All the details of construction are shown in the  accompanying illustration.
    Power is furnished by a very light (110 pounds) Darracq motor, of the  double-opposed-cylinder type.
 It has a bore of 4.
118 inches, and stroke  of 4.
724 inches, runs at 1,800 r.
 p.
 m.
, and with a 6 1/2-foot propeller  develops a thrust of 242 1/2 pounds when the monoplane is held steady.
    Bleriot--No.
 XI, the latest of the Bleriot productions, and the greatest  record maker of the lot, is 28 feet in spread of main plane, and depth  of 6 feet in largest part.
 This would give a main surface of 168 square  feet, but as the ends of the plane are sharply tapered from the rear,  the actual surface is reduced to 150 square feet.
 Projecting from  the main frame is an elongated tail (shown in the illustration) which  carries the horizontal and vertical rudders.
 The former is made in three  sections.
 The center piece is 6 feet 1 inch in spread, and 2 feet 10  inches in depth, containing 17 square feet of surface.
 The end sections,  which are made movable for warping purposes, are each 2 feet 10 inches  square, the combined surface area in the entire horizontal rudder  being 33 square feet.
 The vertical rudder contains 4 1/2 square feet of  surface, making the entire supporting area 187 1/2 square feet.
    From the outer end of the propeller shaft in front to the extreme rear  edge of the vertical rudder, the machine is 25 feet deep.
 Deducting  the 6-foot depth of the main plane leaves 19 feet as the length of the  rudder beam and rudders.
 The motor equipment consists of a 3-cylinder,  air-cooled engine of about 30 h.
 p.
 placed at the front end of the body  frame, and carrying on its crankshaft a two-bladed propeller 6 feet 8  inches in diameter.
 The engine speed is about 1,250 r.
 p.
 m.
 at which  the propeller develops a thrust of over 200 pounds.
    The Bleriot XI complete weighs 484 pounds, and with operator and fuel  supply ready for a 25- or 30-mile flight, 715 pounds.
 One peculiarity of  the Bleriot construction is that, while the ribs of the main plane are  curved, there is no preliminary bending of the pieces as in other forms  of construction.
 Bleriot has his rib pieces cut a little longer than  required and, by springing them into place, secures the necessary  curvature.
 A good view of the Bleriot plane framework is given on page  63.
    Combined Triplane and Biplane.
    At Norwich, Conn.
, the Stebbins-Geynet Co.
, after several years of  experiment, has begun the manufacture of a combination triplane and  biplane machine.
 The center plane, which is located about midway  between the upper and lower surfaces, is made removable.
 The change  from triplane to biplane, or vice versa, may be readily made in a few  minutes.
 The constructors claim for this type of air craft a large  supporting surface area with the minimum of dimensions in planes.
  Although this machine has only 24-foot spread and is only 26 feet over  all, its total amount of supporting area is 400 square feet; weight, 600  pounds in flying order, and lifting capacity approximately 700 pounds  more.
    The frame is made entirely of a selected grade of Oregon spruce,  finished down to a smooth surface and varnished.
 All struts are  fish-shaped and set in aluminum sockets, which are bolted to top and  lower beams with special strong bolts of small diameter.
 The middle  plane is set inside the six uprights and held in place by aluminum  castings.
 A flexible twisted seven-strand wire cable and Stebbins-Geynet  turnbuckles are used for trussing.
    The top plane is in three sections, laced together.
 It has a 24-foot  spread and is 7 feet in depth.
 The middle plane is in two sections each  of 7 1/2 feet spread and 6 feet in depth.
 The center ends of the middle  plane sections do not come within 5 feet of joining, this open space  being left for the engine.
 The bottom plane is of 16 feet spread and 5  feet in depth.
 It will thus be seen that the planes overhang one another  in depth, the bottom one being the smallest in this respect.
 The planes  are set at an angle of 9 degrees, and there is a clear space of 3 1/2  feet between each, making the total distance from the bottom to the top  plane a trifle over 7 feet.
 The total supporting surface in the main  planes is 350 square feet.
 By arranging the three plane surfaces at  an angle as described and varying their size, the greatest amount of  lifting area is secured above the center of gravity, and the greatest  weight carried below.
    The ribs are made of laminated spruce, finished down to 1/2x3/4-inch  cross section dimensions, with a curvature of about 1 in 20, and  fastened to the beams with special aluminum castings.
 Number 2 Naiad  aeroplane cloth is used in covering the planes, with pockets sewn in for  the ribs.
    Two combination elevating rudders are set up well in front, each having  18 square feet of supporting area.
 These rudders are arranged to work  in unison, independently, or in opposite directions.
 In the Model B  machine, there are also two small rear elevating rudders, which work in  unison with the front rudders.
 One vertical rudder of 10 square feet is  suspended in the rear of a small stationary horizontal plane in Model A,  while the vertical rudder on Model B is only 6 square feet in size.
 The  elevating rudders are arranged so as to act as stabilizing planes when  the machine is in flight.
 The wing tips are held in place with a special  two-piece casting which forms a hinge, and makes a quick detachable  joint.
 Wing tips are also used in balancing.
    Model A is equipped with a Cameron 25-30 h.
 p.
, 4-cylinder, air-cooled  motor.
 On Model B a Holmes rotary 7-cylinder motor of 4x4-inch bore and  stroke is used.
    Positive control is secured by use of the Stebbins-Geynet "auto-control"  system.
 A pull or push movement operates the elevating rudders, while  the balancing is done by means of side movements or slight turns.
 The  rear vertical rudder is manipulated by means of a foot lever.
    New Cody Biplane.
    Among the comparatively new biplanes is one constructed by Willard F.
  Cody, of London, Eng.
, the principal distinctive feature of which is an  automatic control which works independently of the hand levers.
 For the  other control a long lever carrying a steering wheel furnishes all the  necessary control movements, there being no footwork at all.
 The lever  is universally jointed and when moved fore and aft operates the two  ailerons as if they were one; when the shaft is rotated it moves the  tail as a whole.
 The horizontal tail component is immovable.
 When the  lever is moved from side to side it works not only the ailerons and  the independent elevators, but also through a peculiar arrangement, the  vertical rear rudder as well.
    The spread of the planes is 46 feet 6 inches and the width 6 feet 6  inches.
 The ailerons jut out 1 foot 6 inches on each side of the machine  and are 13 feet 6 inches long.
 The cross-shaped tail is supported by an  outrigger composed of two long bamboos and of this the vertical plane  is 9 feet by 4 feet, while the horizontal plane is 8 feet by 4 feet.
 The  over-all length of the machine is 36 feet.
 The lifting surface is 857  square feet.
 It will weigh, with a pilot, 1,450 pounds.
 The distance  between the main planes is 8 feet 6 inches, which is a rather notable  feature in this flyer.
    The propeller has a diameter of 11 feet and 2 inches with a 13-foot  6-inch pitch; it is driven at 560 revolutions by a chain, and the gear  reduction between the chain and propeller shaft is two to one.
    The machine from elevator to tail plane bristles in original points.
 The  hump in the ribs has been cut away entirely, so that although the plane  is double surfaced, the surfaces are closest together at a point which  approximates the center of pressure.
 The plane is practically of two  stream-line forms, of which one is the continuation of the other.
  This construction, claims the inventor, will give increased lift, and  decreased head resistance.
 The trials substantiate this, as the angle of  incidence in flying is only about one in twenty-six.
    The ribs in the main planes are made of strips of silver spruce one-half  by one-half inch, while those in the ailerons are solid and one-fourth  inch thick.
 In the main planes the fabric is held down with thin wooden  fillets.
 Cody's planes are noted for their neatness, rigidity and  smoothness.
 Pegamoid fabric is used throughout.
    Pressey Automatic Control.
    Another ingenious system of automatic control has been perfected by Dr.
  J.
 B.
 Pressey, of Newport News, Va.
 The aeroplane is equipped with a  manually operated, vertical rudder, (3), at the stern, and a horizontal,  manually operated, front control, (4), in front.
 At the ends of the main  plane, and about midway between the upper and lower sections thereof,  there are supplemental planes, (5).
    In connection with these supplemental planes (5), there is employed a  gravity influenced weight, the aviator in his seat, for holding them in  a horizontal, or substantially horizontal, position when the main plane  is traveling on an even keel; and for causing them to tip when the main  plane dips laterally, to port or starboard, the planes (5) having  a lifting effect upon the depressed end of the main plane, and a  depressing effect upon the lifted end of the main plane, so as to  correct such lateral dip of the main plane, and restore it to an even  keel.
 To the forward, upper edge of planes (5) connection is made by  means of rod (13) to one arm of a bellcrank lever, (14) the latter being  pivotally mounted upon a fore and aft pin (15), supported from the main  plane; and the other arms of the port and starboard bellcrank levers  (16), are connected by rod (17), which has an eye (18), for receiving  the segmental rod (19), secured to and projecting from cross bar on seat  supporting yoke (7).
 When, therefore, the main plane tips downwardly on  the starboard side, the rod (17) will be moved bodily to starboard, and  the starboard balancing plane (5) will be inclined so as to raise its  forward edge and depress its rear edge, while, at the same time, the  port balancing plane (5), will be inclined so as to depress its forward  edge, and raise its rear edge, thereby causing the starboard balancing  plane to exert a lifting effect, and the port balancing plane to exert a  depressing effect upon the main plane, with the result of restoring the  main plane to an even keel, at which time the balancing planes (5), will  have resumed their normal, horizontal position.
    When the main plane dips downwardly on the port side, a reverse action  takes place, with the like result of restoring the main plane to an even  keel.
 In order to correct forward and aft dip of the main plane, fore  and aft balancing planes (20) and (23) are provided.
 These planes are  carried by transverse rock shafts, which may be pivotally mounted in  any suitable way, upon structures carried by main plane.
 In the present  instance, the forward balancing plane is pivotally mounted in extensions  (21) of the frame (22) which carries the forward, manually operated,  horizontal ascending and descending plane    It is absolutely necessary, in making a turn with an aeroplane, if that  turn is to be made in safety, that the main plane shall be inclined, or  "banked," to a degree proportional to the radius of the curve and to the  speed of the aeroplane.
 Each different curve, at the same speed, demands  a different inclination, as is also demanded by each variation in speed  in rounding like curves.
 This invention gives the desired result with  absolute certainty.
    The Sellers' Multiplane.
    Another innovation is a multiplane, or four-surfaced machine, built and  operated by M.
 B.
 Sellers, formerly of Grahn, Ky.
, but now located at  Norwood, Ga.
 Aside from the use of four sustaining surfaces, the novelty  in the Sellers machine lies in the fact that it is operated successfully  with an 8 h.
 p.
 motor, which is the smallest yet used in actual flight.
  In describing his work, Mr. Sellers says his purpose has been to develop  the efficiency of the surfaces to a point where flight may be obtained  with the minimum of power and, judging by the results accomplished,  he has succeeded.
 In a letter written to the authors of this book, Mr.  Sellers says:    "I dislike having my machine called a quadruplane, because the number of  planes is immaterial; the distinctive feature being the arrangement  of the planes in steps; a better name would be step aeroplane, or step  plane.
    "The machine as patented, comprises two or more planes arranged in step  form, the highest being in front.
 The machine I am now using has four  planes 3 ft.
 x 18 ft.
; total about 200 square feet; camber (arch) 1 in  16.
    "The vertical keel is for lateral stability; the rudder for direction.
  This is the first machine (so far as I know) to have a combination  of wheels and runners or skids (Oct.
 1908).
 The wheels rise up  automatically when the machine leaves the ground, so that it may alight  on the runners.
    "A Duthirt & Chalmers 2-cylinder opposed, 3 1/8-inch engine was used  first, and several hundred short flights were made.
 The engine gave  four brake h.
 p.
, which was barely sufficient for continued flight.
 The  aeroplane complete with this engine weighed 78 pounds.
 The engine now  used is a Bates 3 5/8-inch, 2-cylinder opposed, showing 8 h.
 p.
, and  apparently giving plenty of power.
 The weight of aeroplane with this  engine is now 110 pounds.
 Owing to poor grounds only short flights have  been made, the longest to date (Dec.
 31, 1910) being about 1,000 feet.
    "In building the present machine, my object was to produce a safe, slow,  light, and small h.
 p.
 aeroplane, a purpose which I have accomplished.
"        .

    AVIATION DEVELOPMENT.
    The wonderful progress made in the science of aviation during the  year 1911 far surpasses any twelve months' advancement recorded.
 The  advancement has not been confined to any country or continent, since  every part of the world is taking its part in aviation history making.
    The rapidly increasing interest in aviation has brought forth schools  for the instruction of flying in both the old and new world, and  licensed air pilots before they receive their sanctions from the  governing aero clubs of their country are required to pass an extremely  trying examination in actual flights.
 Exhibition flights and races  were common in all parts of the world during 1911, and touring aviators  visited India, China, Japan, South Africa, Australia and South America,  giving exhibitions and instruction.
    Europe was the scene of a number of cross-country races in which entries  ranging from ten to twenty aviators flew from city to city around a  given circuit, which in some instances exceeded 1,000 miles in distance.
  Cross-country flights with and without passengers became so common that  those of less than two hours' duration attracted little attention.
  There were fewer attempts at high altitude soaring, although the world's  record in this department of aviation was bettered several times.
 In  place of these high flights, the aviators devoted more attention to  speed, duration and spectacular manoeuvres, which appeared to satisfy  the spectators.
 The prize money won during 1911 exceeded $1,000,000, but  owing to the increased number of aviators the individual winnings were  not as large as in 1910.
    It is estimated that within the past twelve months more than 300,000  miles have been covered in aeroplane flights and more than seven  thousand persons, classed either as aviators or passengers, taken up  into the air.
 The aeroplane of today ranges through monoplane, biplane,  triplane and even quadraplane, and more than two hundred types of these  machines are in use.
    Aeroplanes are becoming a factor of international commerce.
 The records  of the Bureau of Statistics show that more than $50,000 worth of  aeroplanes were imported into, and exported from, the United States in  the months of July, August and September, 1911.
 The Bureau of Statistics  only began the maintenance of a separate record of this comparatively  new article of commerce with the opening of the fiscal year 1911-12.
    Two of the prominent developments of 1911 were the introduction of  the hydro-aeroplane and the motorless glider experiments of the  Wright brothers at Killdevil Hills, N.
 C.
, where during the two weeks'  experiments numerous flights with and against the wind were made,  culminating in the establishing of a record by Orville Wright on October  25, 1911, when in a 52-mile per hour blow he reached an elevation of 225  feet and remained in the air 10 minutes and 34 seconds.
 The search  for the secret of automatic stability still continues, and though some  remarkable progress has been made the solution has not yet been reached.
    NOTABLE CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHTS OF 1911.
    One of the important features of 1911 in aviation was the rapid increase  in the number and distance of cross-country flights made either for the  purpose of exhibition, testing, instruction or pleasure.
 Flights between  cities in almost every country of the world became common occurrences.
  So great was the number that only those of more than ordinary importance  because of speed, distance or duration are recorded.
 The flights of  Harry N.
 Atwood from Boston to Washington and from St.
 Louis to New  York, and C.
 P.
 Rodgers from New York to Los Angeles were the most  important events of the kind in this country.
 The St Louis to New York  flight was a distance by air route, 1,266 miles.
 Duration of flight, 12  days.
 Net flying time, 28 hours 53 minutes.
 Average daily flight, 105.
5  miles.
 Average speed, 43.
9 miles per hour.
    Transcontinental Flight of Calbraith P.
 Rodgers.
--All world records  for cross-country flying were broken during the New York to Los Angeles  flight of Calbraith P.
 Rodgers, who left Sheepshead Bay, N.
 Y.
, on  Sunday, September 17, 1911, and completed his flight to the Pacific  Coast on Sunday, November 5, at Pasadena, Cal.
 Rodgers flew a Wright  biplane, and during his long trip the machine was repeatedly repaired,  so great was the strain of the long journey in the air.
 Rodgers is  estimated to have covered 4,231 miles, although the actual route as  mapped out was but 4,017 miles.
 Elapsed time to Pasadena, Cal.
, 49 days;  actual time in the air, 4,924 minutes, equivalent to 3 days 10 hours 4  minutes; average speed approximating 51 miles per hour.
 Rodgers' longest  flight in one day was from Sanderson to Sierra Blanca, Texas, on October  28, when he covered 231 miles.
 On November 12, Rodgers fell at Compton,  Cal.
, and was badly injured, causing a delay of 28 days.
    European Circuit Race.
--Started from Paris on June 18, 1911.
 Distance,  1,073 miles, via Paris to Liege; Liege to Spa to Liege; Liege to  Utrecht, Holland; Utrecht to Brussels, Belgium; Brussels to Roubaix;  Roubaix to Calais; Calais to London; London to Calais and Calais to  Paris.
 Three aeronauts were killed either at the start or shortly after  the race was in progress.
 They were Capt.
 Princetau, M.
 Le Martin and  M.
 Lendron.
 Three others were injured by falls.
 Seven hundred thousand  spectators witnessed the start from the aviation field at Vincennes,  near Paris.
 There were more than forty starters, of which eight  finished.
 The winner, Lieut.
 Jean Conneau, who flies under the name of  "Andre Beaumont," completed the circuit on July 7; his actual net flying  time for the distance being 58h.
 38m.
 4-5s.
    Circuit of England Race--1,010 Miles in Five Sections.
--    Start, July 22.
 Finish, July 26.
 Prize, $50,000.
 Twenty-eight entries  and eighteen starters.
 Seventeen finished the first section from  Brooklands to Hendon, a distance of twenty miles.
 Five reached  Edinburgh, the second section, a distance of 343 miles, and four  completed the entire circuit.
    Paris to Madrid Race.
--This race was started at the Paris aviation  held at Issy-les-Moulineaux on Sunday, May 21.
 There were twenty-one  entrants, and fully 300,000 spectators gathered to witness the initial  flight of the aerial races.
 The race was divided into three stages as  follows: Paris to Angouleme, 248 miles; Angouleme to St.
 Sebastian, 208  miles, and from St.
 Sebastian to Madrid, 386 miles, a total distance  of 842 miles.
 After three of the entrants had safely left the field,  Aviator Train lost control of his plane, and in falling struck and  killed M.
 Berteaux, the French Minister of War, and seriously injured  Premier Monis.
 The accident caused the withdrawal of all but six of the  original entrants, and of these but one finished.
 The race called for  a flight over the Pyrenees Mountains, and Vedrines, the winner, had to  rise to a height of more than 7,000 feet to pass the mountain barrier  near Somosierra Pass.
 Both Vedrines and Gibert, another competitor, were  attacked by eagles during the latter stages of the flight.
 Vedrines,  who started from Paris on Monday, May 22, finished the long and perilous  race at 8:06 a.
 m.
 Friday, May 26.
 Vedrines net flying time, all  controls and enforced stops subtracted, was 14h.
 55m.
 18s.
 The various  prizes to the winner aggregated $30,000.
    The Paris-Rome-Turin Race.
--The conditions of this race called for a  flight between the cities of Paris, Rome and Turin, covering a distance  of 1,300 miles.
 The aviators were permitted by the rules to alight  whenever and wherever they desired and the time limit was set from  May 28 to June 15.

    AEROPLANES AND DIRIGIBLE BALLOONS IN WARFARE.
    Wonderful progress has been made in the development of the aeroplane in  this country and in Europe since 1903, and within the last two or three  years the leading powers of the world have entered upon extensive tests  and experiments to determine its availability and usefulness in land and  naval warfare.
    At the present time all the great powers are building or purchasing  aeroplanes on an extensive scale.
 They have established government  schools for the instruction of their army and navy officers and for  experimental work.
 So-called "Airship Fleets" have been constructed and  placed in commission as auxiliaries to the armies and navies.
 The fleets  of France and Germany are about equal and are larger by far than those  of any of the other powers.
 The length of the dirigibles composing these  fleets runs from 150 to 500 feet; they are equipped with engines of from  50 to 500 horse-power, with a rate of speed ranging from 20 to 30 miles  per hour.
 Their approximate range is from 200 to 900 miles; the longest  actual run (made by the Zeppelin II, Germany) is 800 miles.
    A British naval airship, one of the largest yet built, was completed  last summer.
 It has cost over $200,000, and it was in course of  designing and construction two years.
 It is 510 feet long; can carry 22  persons, and has a lift of 21 tons.
    The relative value of the dirigible balloon and the aeroplane in actual  war is yet to be determined.
 The dirigible is considered to be the  safer, yet several large balloons of this class in Germany and France  have met with disaster, involving loss of lives.
 The capacity of the  dirigible for longer flights and its superior facilities for carrying  apparatus and operators for wireless telegraphy are distinct advantages.
    There has not yet been much opportunity to test the airship in actual  warfare.
 The aeroplane has been used by the Italians in Tripoli for  scouting and reconnoitering and is said to have justified expectations.
  On several occasions the Italian military aviators followed the  movements of the enemy, in one instance as far as forty miles inland.
 At  the time of the attack by the Turks a skillful aeroplane reconnaissance  revealed the approach of a large Turkish force, believed to be at the  time sixty miles away in the mountains.
    Aeroplanes and airships, as they exist today, would doubtless render  very valuable service in a time of war, both over land and water, in  scouting, reconnoitering, carrying dispatches, and as some experts  believe, in locating submarines and mines placed by the enemy in  channels of exits from ports.
 A "coast aeroplane" could fly out 30 or 40  miles from land, and rising to a great height, descry any hostile ships  on the distant horizon, observe their number, strength, formation and  direction, and return within two hours with a report to obtain which  would require several swift torpedo-boat destroyers and a much greater  time.
 The question as to whether it would be practicable to bombard an  enemy on land or sea with explosive bombs dropped or discharged from  flying machines or airships, is one which is much discussed but hardly  yet determined.
    Aeroplanes have been constructed with floats in the place of runners and  several attempts have been made, in some cases successfully, to light  with them on and to rise from the water.
 Mr. Curtiss did this at San  Francisco, in January, 1911.
 Attempts have also been made with the  aeroplane to alight on and to take flight from the deck of a warship.
  Toward the end of 1910 Aviator Ely flew to land from the cruiser  Birmingham, and in January, 1911, he flew from land and alighted on the  cruiser Pennsylvania.
 But in these cases special arrangements were made  which would be hardly practicable in a time of actual war.
    In November, 1911, a test was made at Newport, R.
 I.
, by Lieut.
 Rodgers,  of the navy, of a "hydro-areoplane" as an auxiliary to a battleship.
 The  idea of the test was to alight alongside of the ship, hoist the machine  aboard, put out to sea and launch the machine again with the use of a  crane.
 Lieut.
 Rodgers came down smoothly alongside the Ohio, his machine  was easily drawn aboard with a crane, and the Ohio steamed down to  the open sea, where it was blowing half a gale.
 But, owing to the  misjudgment of the ship's headway, one of the wings of the machine when  it struck the water after being released from the crane, went under the  water and was snapped off.
 Lieut.
 Rodgers was convinced that this method  was too risky and that some other must be devised.
