\section{Resources}\label{sec:resources}
For our initial training and testing of our neural language model on fairly small
subsets of our data, we plan to request a dedicated lab machine in CMC 307.
This machine will eventually also allow us to serve our webapp until we agree
upon a longer-term solution.

As the computational requirements of the training process become clearer to us
over the second half of fall term, we will likely need more processing power
than a single iMac can offer.  There are two possible ways for us to get this
increased power. First, we can work with Mike Tie to gain access to the new
research cluster (summer18.dmz.carleton.edu).  This option is limited due to the
cluster being primarily intended for faculty research, but we may be able to get
our tasks in at a lower priority. Second, we plan on using the Jetson TX2 Dev Kit
for our more advanced training. Itâ€™s a machine-learning-specific graphics card
developed by Nvidia and will allow us to train more advanced neural networks
faster and better than our other options. Malcolm has access to this resource
through the St. Olaf - Carleton Engineering team, which has two available for use.

To build mockups for our web UI (as well as for any other platforms we may extend
onto), we plan on using Balsamiq, a wireframing program.  We should be able to
get by with free trial options, but if we end up relying on it more than expected
during our UI design process, we might request a month-or-two-long subscription
to its cloud service (at \$9 per month).
