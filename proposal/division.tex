\section{Division of work}\label{sec:division}
We plan on working together as a full group on the most critical parts of the
implementation of our RNN.  This neural language model will be the conceptual
core of our project, so it is important that every group member has the opportunity
to develop a high-level understanding of how it works.  However, Malcolm and 
Tenzin will take the lead on figuring out the lower-level details of the RNN
and optimizing its performance.  Ben will focus on finding and processing our
training data, while Galen will begin developing the front-facing elements of
our project like our UI and web framework.
