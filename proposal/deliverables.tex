\section{Deliverables}\label{sec:deliverables}
\subsection{Minimumm Viable Product}\label{subsec:mvp}
Our most basic possible deliverable will be a webapp with a simple interface that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prompts the user with an image
  \item Takes input from the user one sentence at a time
  \item After each sentence of input:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Generates a reasonable next sentence using a context-sensitive neural
        language model
    \item Displays it to the user for review and editing
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Extensions}\label{subsec:extensions}
Below are a selection of possible improvements to our minimum deliverable as
described above, ranging from trivial to wildly optimistic. Depending on how
closely we are able to follow our roadmap, we expect to implement at least 2-4 of these.
\subsubsection{Core Improvements}\label{subsubsec:core_imp}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Modern, professional-looking interface design
  \item Variable context-sensitivity in the language model, so it can take more than the previous sentence into account when generating the next sentence
  \item Additional language models trained on different genres
  \item More in-depth writing prompt generator (possibly using our language model or the beam search approach\cite{clark})
  \item Opt-in account system to save users’ stories and preferences (and to facilitate the implementation of several additional features below)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Extended Functionality}\label{subsubsec:ext_fun}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Export a completed story in multiple formats
  \item Save a story in progress and come back to it later
  \item Share a completed story on social media
  \item Option to choose when to ask AI for a suggestion rather than automatically
  getting one after every sentence
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Extra Modes}\label{subsubsec:extra_modes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Multiplayer mode to allow collaboration with another human rather than
  the AI
  \item Timed mode to help break down writer’s block
  \item AI mode to watch multiple AI collaborate on a story without human input
  (for entertainment value)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Additional Platforms}\label{subsubsec:addtnl_pltfm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item iOS
  \item Android
  \item Desktop app(MacOS or Windows)
\end{itemize}
