\section{Individual tasks}\label{sec:indiv}
Although we will be working as a group on much of the project, we have each set
individual goals for the remainder of Fall Term, in alignment with our general
directions as discussed above. These goals are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Malcolm: have a RNN that compiles and runs to completion in Tensorflow
  \item Tenzin: deliver a write up of the possible optimization strategies to improve the efficiency of the neural network
  \item Galen: design a basic web interface for the application using Balsamiq,
        set up a simple webapp with Django for the RNN to slot into
  \item Ben: Develop data sources via a webscraper and efficiently manage RNN
  training.
\end{itemize}
