\section{Vision}\label{sec:vison}
There is not a single writer who hasn’t dealt with the issue of writer's block. It’s a problem that can destroy someone's creative potential for extended periods of time with seemingly little recourse.  Writers often try to overcome this hurdle and to generate inspiration for their stories with collaborative writing games, which require the participation of multiple people in order to help break down the participants’ creative barriers. Our project seeks to provide an alternative to these cooperative writing games by providing solo writers with an artificial writing partner.

We propose a neural network that will generate inspiration during the creative writing process to help mitigate the effects of or even prevent writer's block (Clark et. al). This neural network, under the working title of WriterBot, will function as an in-the-loop aid to the writer in an interactive system where both parties take turns writing sentences. The writer will write a sentence and WriterBot will generate another sentence based on the writer’s input to serve as the next line of the story. The writer will then have a chance to edit or delete WriterBot’s sentence before continuing onto their own next sentence, ultimately creating a story that is the product of both machine and human inspiration.

We hope to extend Clark et al.’s human-centric approach by giving users the option to choose when to seek suggestions from the machine (Roemmele et al.) in contrast to suggestions being automatically generated by the machine after each sentence input, thereby giving people the ability to control the level of machine intrusiveness in their writing process.  We will also try to generalize the original paper’s approach by exploiting information from a larger context outside of just the user’s previous sentence, as well as by training the machine with data from different genres of fiction.  Finally, we would like to extend the original paper by providing a more robust suite of related tools, including prompt generation and the ability to save and share WriterBot-generated stories. We hope WriterBot will be able to inspire writers to take their stories in new and creative directions, and to provide an enjoyable way to get unstuck in the creative writing process.
