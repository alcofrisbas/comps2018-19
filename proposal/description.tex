\section{Description}\label{sec:description}
To generate WriterBotâ€™s suggestions, we will use a recurrent neural network based
language model (RNN LM). RNNs are very efficient in predicting results in sequential
data. They allow information to cycle inside the network for a very long time,
allowing access to more contextual information than just the previous sentence
to predict the next sentence, and provide output from the entire as input to
processing subsequent data.

We will use a simple recurrent neural network architecture\cite{RNN_language_model},
which is relatively easy to implement and train. We will also explore different
optimization techniques to improve the performance of the neural network.
