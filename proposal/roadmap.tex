\section{Roadmap}\label{sec:roadmap}
We have two general phases of work, and we will divide them by term.
This term is our neural network phase, and winter term will be our UI/UX and
feature phase.

By the end of this term, we want to have a working CLI for our RNN, as well
as a useable dataset that fits our needs. We plan on writing the majority of
our code in Python, so our first step will be to determine which libraries to
use for numerical computation and the neural net. Our larger step will be to
decide and implement the inner structure of the RNN,  which we plan to have
done by the end of the term. Concurrently, we will get access to data.
Unfortunately, we are unable to use the fiction database that the original
paper\cite{clark} used, so finding decent data and scraping it is a priority,
because training will require that data. Our current solution is to use
alternative data in our preliminary models as a stand-in while better data
is found.

Our winter term agenda is to implement a UI for our CLI. Since our code will
be in Python, our plan is to use Django to create a web app. We want this done
in the first few weeks of winter term so we can work on further feature development.
These features are fleshed out more fully, as is our main goal in the Section \ref{sec:deliverables}.

We view the RNN as the more technically difficult task in this project, which
is why we are placing very heavy priority on its completion as soon as possible.
While not trivial, a UI is something that all of us have some experience with,
and will require less technical time than perfecting our language model, which,
again, is the core of our project.
